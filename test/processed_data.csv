as well as india , the middle east and africa . greater china includes china mainland , hong kong and taiwan . rest of asia pacific includes australia and those asian countries not included in the company ’s other reportable segments . although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services , each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the company ’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region . markets and distribution the company ’s customers are primarily in the consumer , small and mid - sized business , education , enterprise and government markets . the company sells its products and resells third - party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force . the company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels , such as third - party cellular network carriers , wholesalers , retailers and resellers . during [XXXX] , the company ’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for [XX] % and [XX] % , respectively , of total net sales . competition the markets for the company ’s products and services are highly competitive , and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins , frequent introduction of new products and services , short product life cycles , evolving industry standards , continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics , rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors , and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses . many of the company ’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures , and by imitating the company ’s products and infringing on its intellectual property . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company ’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products , services and technologies to the marketplace . the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products , including the hardware , operating system , numerous software applications and related services . principal competitive factors important to the company include price , product and service features ( including security features ) , relative price and performance , product and service quality and reliability , design innovation , a strong third - party software and accessories ecosystem , marketing and distribution capability , service and support , and corporate reputation . the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones , personal computers , tablets , wearables and accessories , and services . the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical , marketing , distribution and other resources , as well as established hardware , software , and service offerings with large customer bases . in addition , some of the company ’s competitors have broader product lines , lower - priced products and a larger installed base of active devices . competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins . certain competitors have the resources , experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss . the company ’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third - party digital content and applications . the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company ’s product features and applications within their products , or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer . supply of components although most components essential to the company ’s business are generally available from multiple sources , certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources . the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones , personal computers , tablets , wearables and accessories . therefore , many components used by the company , including those that are available from multiple sources , are at times subject to industry - wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations . the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors , and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source . when a component or product uses new technologies , initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers ’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased . the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices , or at all , may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company ’s requirements . the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components ; however , there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms , or at all . research and development because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances , the company ’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products , services and technologies to the marketplace . the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services , and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development ( “ r&d ” ) , licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third - party businesses and technology . intellectual property the company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices , accessories , software and services . this includes patents , designs , copyrights , trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the u.s . and various foreign countries . although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership , the company relies primarily on the innovative skills , technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel . the company regularly files patent , design , copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research , development , design and marketing , and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world . over time , the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world . no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company ’s products and services . the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services . in addition to company - owned intellectual property , many of the company ’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties . it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company ’s products , processes and services . while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past , there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] business seasonality and product introductions the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand . additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses . the timing of product introductions can also impact the company ’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch , and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches . net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction . human capital the company believes it has a talented , motivated and dedicated team , and works to create an inclusive , safe and supportive environment for all of its team members . as of september [XX] , [XXXX] , the company had approximately [XXX,XXX] full - time equivalent employees . workplace practices and policies the company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination . compensation and benefits the company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable , and should enable employees to share in the company ’s success . the company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives . in support of this , the company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees ’ individual growth and development . inclusion and diversity the company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves . the company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level , foster an inclusive culture , and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees . engagement the company believes that open and honest communication among team members , managers and leaders helps create an open , collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute , grow and succeed . team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions , feedback or concerns , and the company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development , manager performance and inclusivity . health and safety the company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates . the company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards . the company supports employees with general safety , security and crisis management training , and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high - hazard environments . additionally , the company works to protect the safety and security of its team members , visitors and customers through its global security team . available information the company ’s annual reports on form [XX] - k , quarterly reports on form [XX] - q , current reports on form [X] - k , and amendments to reports filed pursuant to sections 13(a ) and 15(d ) of the securities exchange act of [XXXX] , as amended ( the “ exchange act ” ) , are filed with the u.s . securities and exchange commission ( the “ sec ” ) . such reports and other information filed by the company with the sec are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such reports are available on the sec ’s website . the company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website , and its investor relations website , investor.apple.com . this includes press releases and other information about financial performance , information on environmental , social and governance matters , and details related to the company ’s annual meeting of shareholders . the information contained on the websites referenced in this form [XX] - k is not incorporated by reference into this filing . further , the company ’s references to website urls are intended to be inactive textual references only . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X]","item 1a . risk factors the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations , financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors , whether currently known or unknown , including those described below . when any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time , the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations , financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected . because of the following factors , as well as other factors affecting the company ’s results of operations and financial condition , past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance , and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods . this discussion of risk factors contains forward - looking statements . this section should be read in conjunction with part ii , item [X] , “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in part ii , item [X] , “ financial statements and supplementary data ” of this form [XX] - k. macroeconomic and industry risks the company ’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company has international operations with sales outside the u.s . representing a majority of the company ’s total net sales . in addition , the company ’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the company ’s supplier facilities , including manufacturing and assembly sites , are located outside the u.s . as a result , the company ’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions . adverse macroeconomic conditions , including slow growth or recession , high unemployment , inflation , tighter credit , higher interest rates , and currency fluctuations , can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the company ’s products and services . in addition , consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy , financial market volatility , declines in income or asset values , and other economic factors . in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company ’s products and services , uncertainty about , or a decline in , global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the company ’s suppliers , contract manufacturers , logistics providers , distributors , cellular network carriers and other channel partners , and developers . potential outcomes include financial instability ; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations ; and insolvency . adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company ’s trade receivables ; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions ; limitations on the company ’s ability to issue new debt ; reduced liquidity ; and declines in the fair values of the company ’s financial instruments . these and other impacts can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations , financial condition and stock price . the company ’s business can be impacted by political events , trade and other international disputes , war , terrorism , natural disasters , public health issues , industrial accidents and other business interruptions . political events , trade and other international disputes , war , terrorism , natural disasters , public health issues , industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy , and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers , suppliers , contract manufacturers , logistics providers , distributors , cellular network carriers and other channel partners . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company has a large , global business with sales outside the u.s . representing a majority of the company ’s total net sales , and the company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade . substantially all of the company ’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in china mainland , india , japan , south korea , taiwan and vietnam . restrictions on international trade , such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods , technology or data , can materially adversely affect the company ’s operations and supply chain and limit the company ’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers . the impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations . restrictive measures can require the company to take various actions , including changing suppliers , restructuring business relationships , and ceasing to offer third - party applications on its platforms . changing the company ’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive , time - consuming and disruptive to the company ’s operations . such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures . for example , tensions between governments , including the u.s . and china , have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the company ’s business . if disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future , actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the company ’s business . political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending , which could adversely affect the company ’s business . many of the company ’s operations and facilities , as well as critical business operations of the company ’s suppliers and contract manufacturers , are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters . in addition , such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire , power shortages , nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents , terrorist attacks and other hostile acts , ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks , labor disputes , public health issues , including pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic , and other events beyond the company ’s control . global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters , such as droughts , floods , hurricanes and wildfires , occurring more frequently or with more intense effects . such events can make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers , create delays and inefficiencies in the company ’s supply and manufacturing chain , and result in slowdowns and outages to the company ’s service offerings , and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas . following an interruption to its business , the company can require substantial recovery time , experience significant expenditures to resume operations , and lose significant sales . because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components , a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company . the company ’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers . while the company ’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations , an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life , disruption to the company ’s business , and harm to the company ’s reputation . major public health issues , including pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic , have adversely affected , and could in the future materially adversely affect , the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products ; the imposition of protective public safety measures , such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions ; and disruptions in the company ’s operations , supply chain and sales and distribution channels , resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services , and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services . while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses , such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise . global markets for the company ’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change , and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets . the company ’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins , frequent introduction of new products and services , short product life cycles , evolving industry standards , continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics , rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors , and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses . the company ’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products , services and technologies to the marketplace . the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products , including the hardware , operating system , numerous software applications and related services . as a result , the company must make significant investments in r&d . there can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns , and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company currently holds a significant number of patents , trademarks and copyrights and has registered , and applied to register , additional patents , trademarks and copyrights . in contrast , many of the company ’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures , and by imitating the company ’s products and infringing on its intellectual property . effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the company operates . if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company ’s intellectual property , the company ’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected . the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone , personal computer and tablet markets . the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical , marketing , distribution and other resources , as well as established hardware , software and digital content supplier relationships . in addition , some of the company ’s competitors have broader product lines , lower - priced products and a larger installed base of active devices . competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins . certain competitors have the resources , experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss . some of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall . additionally , the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company ’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer . the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the company ’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions . the company ’s services also face substantial competition , including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases . the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free . the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third - party digital content and applications . the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the company ’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages . there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively . business risks to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand , the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services . due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the company competes , the company must continually introduce new products , services and technologies , enhance existing products and services , effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services , and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services . the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors , including timely and successful development , market acceptance , the company ’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp - up issues , the availability of application software for the company ’s products , the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand , the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand , and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies . there can be no assurance the company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services . the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners , many of which are located outside of the u.s . substantially all of the company ’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in china mainland , india , japan , south korea , taiwan and vietnam , and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners , often in single locations . changes or additions to the company ’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties . the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management . while these arrangements can lower operating costs , they also reduce the company ’s direct control over production and distribution . such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided , or adversely affect the company ’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions . although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement , the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out - of - warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time . while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct , violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company relies on single - source outsourcing partners in the u.s . , asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components , and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia , for final assembly of substantially all of the company ’s hardware products . any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the company ’s cost or supply of components or finished goods . in addition , manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons , including natural and man - made disasters , information technology system failures , commercial disputes , armed conflict , economic , business , labor , environmental , public health or political issues , or international trade disputes . the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment , much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners , and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long - term supply agreements . while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods , if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business , such continued supply can be reduced or terminated , and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted . future operating results depend upon the company ’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms . because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources , the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks . many components , including those that are available from multiple sources , are at times subject to industry - wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . for example , the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply , which adversely affected the company ’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all . such disruptions could occur in the future . while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components , there can be no assurance the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms , or at all . component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions , which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry , further limiting the company ’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all . the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company ’s suppliers , described in “ the company ’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition , ” above , can also affect the company ’s ability to obtain components . therefore , the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source . when a component or product uses new technologies , initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers ’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased . the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices , or at all , can be affected for any number of reasons , including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company ’s requirements . when the company ’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained , or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the company , the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source , or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source . the company ’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company ’s business and result in harm to the company ’s reputation . the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects . sophisticated operating system software and applications , such as those offered by the company , often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services . defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties . component defects could make the company ’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury . these risks may increase as the company ’s products are introduced into specialized applications , including health . in addition , the company ’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages , service slowdowns or errors . as a result , from time to time the company ’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations . there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware , software and services it offers . failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company ’s products and services . in addition , the company can be exposed to product liability claims , recalls , product replacements or modifications , write - offs of inventory , property , plant and equipment or intangible assets , and significant warranty and other expenses , including litigation costs and regulatory fines . quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company ’s products and services , and result in harm to the company ’s reputation , loss of competitive advantage , poor market acceptance , reduced demand for products and services , delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company is exposed to the risk of write - downs on the value of its inventory and other assets , in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk . the company records a write - down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand , or for which cost exceeds net realizable value . the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components . the company reviews long - lived assets , including capital assets held at its suppliers ’ facilities and inventory prepayments , for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable . if the company determines that an impairment has occurred , it records a write - down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value . although the company believes its inventory , capital assets , inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable , there can be no assurance the company will not incur write - downs , fees , impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes . the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments . manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company ’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements , typically for periods up to [XXX] days . because the company ’s markets are volatile , competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products , or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments . the company relies on access to third - party intellectual property , which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all . the company ’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties , which requires licenses from those third parties . in addition , because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete , current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents , the company ’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others . from time to time , the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties . based on experience and industry practice , the company believes licenses to such third - party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms . however , there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all . failure to obtain the right to use third - party intellectual property , or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms , can preclude the company from selling certain products or services , or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s future performance depends in part on support from third - party software developers . the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third - party software applications and services . there can be no assurance third - party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company ’s products . if third - party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company ’s products , customers may choose not to buy the company ’s products . the company believes the availability of third - party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers ’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing , maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company ’s products compared to competitors ’ platforms , such as android for smartphones and tablets , windows for personal computers and tablets , and playstation , nintendo and xbox for gaming platforms . this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products , the anticipated revenue that may be generated , expected future growth of product sales , and the costs of developing such applications and services . the company ’s minority market share in the global smartphone , personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company ’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors ’ products with larger market share . when developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms , the availability and quality of applications for the company ’s devices can suffer . the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products . the company ’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change , and when third - party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change , their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences , can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the company ’s products . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company distributes third - party applications for its products through the app store . for the vast majority of applications , developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the app store . the company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application . from time to time , the company has made changes to its app store , including actions taken in response to competition , market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements . the company expects to make further business changes in the future , including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the app store , such as the european union ( “ eu ” ) digital markets act , which the company is required to comply with by march [XXXX] . the company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the app store , which have resulted in changes to the company ’s business practices , and may in the future result in further changes . changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms . future changes could also affect what the company charges developers for access to its platforms , how it manages distribution of apps outside of the app store , and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms . this could reduce the volume of sales , and the commission that the company earns on those sales , would decrease . if the rate of the commission that the company retains on such sales is reduced , or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated , the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected . failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the company ’s customers , or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms , could have a material adverse impact on the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers . this includes the right to sell , or offer subscriptions to , third - party content , as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the company ’s own services . the licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms , or at all . some third - party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services , and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content . other content owners , providers or distributors may seek to limit the company ’s access to , or increase the cost of , such content . the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules . the company also produces its own digital content , which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent , content and subscribers , and may fail to appeal to the company ’s customers . some third - party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions . if requirements change , the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions . there can be no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner . the company ’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members , the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees , including key personnel , and the company ’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture . much of the company ’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel , including its chief executive officer , executive team and other highly skilled employees . experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense , especially in silicon valley , where most of the company ’s key personnel are located . in addition to intense competition for talent , workforce dynamics are constantly evolving . if the company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively , it could materially adversely affect the company ’s culture , reputation and operational flexibility . the company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success . if the company is unable to nurture its culture , it could materially adversely affect the company ’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success , and could otherwise materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company depends on the performance of carriers , wholesalers , retailers and other resellers . the company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers , wholesalers , retailers and resellers , many of which distribute products and services from competitors . the company also sells its products and services and resells third - party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers , small and mid - sized businesses , and education , enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force . some carriers providing cellular network service for the company ’s products offer financing , installment payment plans or subsidies for users ’ purchases of the device . there can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales , including staffing selected resellers ’ stores with company employees and contractors , and improving product placement displays . these programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales . the financial condition of these resellers could weaken , these resellers could stop distributing the company ’s products , or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company ’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company ’s products . the company ’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions . the company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters , accidents , power disruptions , telecommunications failures , acts of terrorism or war , computer viruses , physical or electronic break - ins , ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents , or other events or disruptions . system upgrades , redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate , and the company ’s or its vendors ’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities . such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company ’s business by , among other things , preventing access to the company ’s online services , interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company ’s products . these events could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information , including personal information , could subject the company to significant reputational , financial , legal and operational consequences . the company ’s business requires it to use and store confidential information , including personal information , with respect to the company ’s customers and employees . the company devotes significant resources to network and data security , including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data . but these measures can not provide absolute security , and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties . the company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations . although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the company ’s behalf , such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to , or releases of , confidential information occur . such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis . these attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality , integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations , and can , among other things , impair the company ’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services , impact the company ’s stock price , materially damage commercial relationships , and expose the company to litigation or government investigations , which could result in penalties , fines or judgments against the company . globally , attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls , avoid detection , and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence , all of which hinders the company ’s ability to identify , investigate and recover from incidents . in addition , attacks against the company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict . although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information , including personal information , affect many companies across various industries , the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates , owns , manages , stores and processes . the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data , and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access , including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies . as with all companies , these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking , ransomware attacks , employee error , malfeasance , system error , faulty password management or other irregularities . for example , third parties can fraudulently induce the company ’s or its vendors ’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames , passwords or other sensitive information , which can , in turn , be used for unauthorized access to the company ’s or its vendors ’ systems and services . to help protect customers and the company , the company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication , monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances , which , among other things , can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company ’s products and services . while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks , such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company ’s ongoing business , present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company has invested , and in the future may invest , in new business strategies or acquisitions . such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties , including distraction of management from current operations , greater - than - expected liabilities and expenses , economic , political , legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses , regions or countries , inadequate return on capital , potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets , and significant write - offs . investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks , including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all , or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the company ’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction . these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful . the failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties . the company ’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition , including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity . other factors include the company ’s ability to : manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation ; manage relationships with existing retail partners ; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory ; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost . legal and regulatory compliance risks the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations . the company is subject to various claims , legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved , and new matters may arise in the future . in addition , agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party . the number of claims , legal proceedings and government investigations involving the company , and the alleged magnitude of such claims , proceedings and government investigations , has generally increased over time and may continue to increase . the company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular - enabled products , and new claims may arise in the future , including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks . for example , technology and other patent - holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights . the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several u.s . jurisdictions , as well as internationally in various countries . the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages . regardless of the merit of particular claims , defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive , time - consuming and disruptive to the company ’s operations . in recognition of these considerations , the company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges . there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur . these agreements can also significantly increase the company ’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the company to change its business practices and limit the company ’s ability to offer certain products and services . except as described in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k under the heading “ legal proceedings ” and in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note [XX] , “ commitments , contingencies and supply concentrations ” under the heading “ contingencies , ” in the opinion of management , there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss , or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual , concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims . the outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain . if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management ’s expectations , the company ’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected . further , such an outcome can result in significant compensatory , punitive or trebled monetary damages , disgorgement of revenue or profits , remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company , and has from time to time required , and can in the future require , the company to change its business practices and limit the company ’s ability to offer certain products and services , all of which could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims , such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] the company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide , which exposes the company to potential liabilities , increased costs and other adverse effects on the company ’s business . the company ’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects , including antitrust ; privacy , data security and data localization ; consumer protection ; advertising , sales , billing and e - commerce ; financial services and technology ; product liability ; intellectual property ownership and infringement ; digital platforms ; machine learning and artificial intelligence ; internet , telecommunications and mobile communications ; media , television , film and digital content ; availability of third - party software applications and services ; labor and employment ; anticorruption ; import , export and trade ; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions ; anti – money laundering ; foreign ownership and investment ; tax ; and environmental , health and safety , including electronic waste , recycling , product design and climate change . compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive . new and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the company ’s business by increasing the company ’s costs , limiting the company ’s ability to offer a product , service or feature to customers , imposing changes to the design of the company ’s products and services , impacting customer demand for the company ’s products and services , and requiring changes to the company ’s supply chain and its business . new and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied . these risks and costs may increase as the company ’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications , including health and financial services . the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations , but there can be no assurance the company ’s employees , contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company ’s policies and procedures . if the company is found to have violated laws and regulations , it could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the company ’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures . for example , the company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products . although the company has programs , policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements , there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation . as a result , the company ’s products could be banned , delayed or prohibited from importation , which could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . expectations relating to environmental , social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the company to potential liabilities , increased costs , reputational harm , and other adverse effects on the company ’s business . many governments , regulators , investors , employees , customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental , social and governance considerations relating to businesses , including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions , human and civil rights , and diversity , equity and inclusion . in addition , the company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non - financial reports , information provided on its website , press statements and other communications . responding to these environmental , social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties , requires investments , and depends in part on third - party performance or data that is outside the company ’s control . the company can not guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental , social and governance goals and initiatives . in addition , some stakeholders may disagree with the company ’s goals and initiatives . any failure , or perceived failure , by the company to achieve its goals , further its initiatives , adhere to its public statements , comply with federal , state or international environmental , social and governance laws and regulations , or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the company and materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations , financial condition and stock price . the technology industry , including , in some instances , the company , is subject to intense media , political and regulatory scrutiny , which exposes the company to increasing regulation , government investigations , legal actions and penalties . from time to time , the company has made changes to its app store , including actions taken in response to litigation , competition , market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements . the company expects to make further business changes in the future , including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the app store , such as the eu digital markets act , which the company is required to comply with by march [XXXX] , or similar laws in other jurisdictions . changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms . future changes could also affect what the company charges developers for access to its platforms , how it manages distribution of apps outside of the app store , and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] the company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world , which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could , individually or in the aggregate , have a materially adverse impact on the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . for example , the company is the subject of investigations in europe and other jurisdictions relating to app store terms and conditions . if such investigations result in adverse findings against the company , the company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its app store business , all of which could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company is also subject to litigation relating to the app store , which has resulted in changes to the company ’s business practices , and may in the future result in further changes . further , the company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that , if resolved against those other companies , could materially adversely affect the company ’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . for example , the company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the company ’s platforms and applications , and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings . there can be no assurance the company ’s business will not be materially adversely affected , individually or in the aggregate , by the outcomes of such investigations , litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future . changes to the company ’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the company ’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the company ’s products and services , and result in harm to the company ’s reputation , loss of competitive advantage , poor market acceptance , reduced demand for products and services , and lost sales . the company ’s business is subject to a variety of u.s . and international laws , rules , policies and other obligations regarding data protection . the company is subject to an increasing number of federal , state and international laws relating to the collection , use , retention , security and transfer of various types of personal information . in many cases , these laws apply not only to third - party transactions , but also restrict transfers of personal information among the company and its international subsidiaries . several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area , and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending . these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the company to change its business practices . noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability . the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy , information provided on its website , press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers . any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal , state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others . in addition to reputational impacts , penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability . in addition to the risks generally relating to the collection , use , retention , security and transfer of personal information , the company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws , such as health data , financial data and biometric data . health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy , security and breach notification requirements , and the company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company ’s compliance with these obligations . if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements , or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company ’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions , the company can be subject to litigation or government investigations , and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses , and can also incur significant fees or fines . payment card data is also subject to additional requirements . under payment card rules and obligations , if cardholder information is potentially compromised , the company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards . the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards , which could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] financial risks the company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate . the company ’s profit margins vary across its products , services , geographic segments and distribution channels . for example , the gross margins on the company ’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time . the company ’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors , including : continued industry - wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures ; increased competition ; the company ’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services ; compressed product life cycles ; supply shortages ; potential increases in the cost of components , outside manufacturing services , and developing , acquiring and delivering content for the company ’s services ; the company ’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively ; shifts in the mix of products and services , or in the geographic , currency or channel mix , including to the extent that regulatory changes require the company to modify its product and service offerings ; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates ; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures ; and the introduction of new products or services , including new products or services with higher cost structures . these and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the company ’s results of operations and financial condition . the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand . additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses . further , the company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales . the company could also be subject to unexpected developments , such as lower - than - anticipated demand for the company ’s products or services , issues with new product or service introductions , information technology system failures or network disruptions , or failure of one of the company ’s logistics , components supply , or manufacturing partners . the company ’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s . dollar relative to local currencies . the company ’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non – u.s . dollar – denominated sales , cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide . gross margins on the company ’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations . the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s . dollar adversely affects the u.s . dollar value of the company ’s foreign currency – denominated sales and earnings , and generally leads the company to raise international pricing , potentially reducing demand for the company ’s products . in some circumstances , for competitive or other reasons , the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the u.s . dollar ’s strengthening , which would adversely affect the u.s . dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency – denominated sales . conversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s . dollar , while generally beneficial to the company ’s foreign currency – denominated sales and earnings , could cause the company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments , thereby limiting the benefit . additionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company ’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies , thus adversely affecting gross margins . the company uses derivative instruments , such as foreign currency forward and option contracts , to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates . the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any , or more than a portion , of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place . the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio . the company ’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity , credit deterioration , financial results , market and economic conditions , political risk , sovereign risk , interest rate fluctuations or other factors . as a result , the value and liquidity of the company ’s cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially . therefore , although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities , future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the company ’s results of operations and financial condition . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable , vendor non - trade receivables and prepayments related to long - term supply agreements , and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen . the company distributes its products and certain of its services through third - party cellular network carriers , wholesalers , retailers and resellers . the company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid - sized businesses and education , enterprise and government customers . a substantial majority of the company ’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral , third - party bank support or financing arrangements , or credit insurance , and a significant portion of the company ’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers . the company ’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited . the company also has unsecured vendor non - trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company . in addition , the company has made prepayments associated with long - term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components . as of september [XX] , [XXXX] , the company ’s vendor non - trade receivables and prepayments related to long - term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia . while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non - trade receivables , as well as long - term prepayments , there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses . the company is subject to changes in tax rates , the adoption of new u.s . or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities . the company is subject to taxes in the u.s . and numerous foreign jurisdictions , including ireland and singapore , where a number of the company ’s subsidiaries are organized . due to economic and political conditions , tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non - income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change . for example , the organisation for economic co - operation and development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules , including the introduction of global minimum tax standards . the company ’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates , changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities , the introduction of new taxes , and changes in tax laws or their interpretation . the application of tax laws may be uncertain , require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations . the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u.s . internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies . the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes . there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations . if the company ’s effective tax rates were to increase , or if the ultimate determination of the company ’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued , the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected . general risks the price of the company ’s stock is subject to volatility . the company ’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future . additionally , the company , the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have , from time to time , experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies ’ operating performance . price volatility may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock ’s price at a given point in time . the company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability . the company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow , and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated . future dividends are subject to declaration by the company ’s board of directors , and the company ’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares . if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth , profitability , dividends , share repurchases or other market expectations , the price of the company ’s stock may decline significantly , which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention ."

students , and consumers be more productive . growth in devices is dependent on total pc shipments , the ability to attract new customers , our product roadmap , and expanding into new categories . gaming our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content , community , and cloud services . our exclusive game content is created through xbox game studios , a collection of first - party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences . we continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators . these unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of xbox game pass , a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over [XXX] first- and third - party console and pc titles . the gamer remains at the heart of the xbox ecosystem . we are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points through our first- and third - party content and business diversification across subscriptions , ads , and digital stores . we ’ve seen new devices from third - party manufacturers along with key pc and mobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them . we are focused on growing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible . xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on xbox consoles , windows - enabled devices , and other devices . xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base . xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third - party content , as well as advertising . growth of our gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through xbox enabled content , availability of games , providing exclusive game content that gamers seek , the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services , and the ability to create new experiences through first - party content creators . part i item [X] search and news advertising our search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search , native , and display advertising to a global audience . our microsoft edge browser and bing chat capabilities are key tools to enable user acquisition and engagement , while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions . in addition to first - party tools , we have several partnerships with companies , such as yahoo , through which we provide and monetize search offerings . growth depends on our ability to attract new users , understand intent , and match intent with relevant content on advertising offerings . competition windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices , mainly from apple and google . we believe windows competes effectively by giving customers choice , value , flexibility , security , an easy - to - use interface , and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications , including those that enable productivity . devices face competition from various computer , tablet , and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high - quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points . these manufacturers , many of which are also current or potential partners and customers , include apple and our windows oems . xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services , including those operated by amazon , apple , meta , and tencent . we also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms . our gaming platform competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony , both of which have a large , established base of customers . we believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against , and uniquely differentiated from , competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture , user interface , developer tools , online gaming and entertainment services , and continued strong exclusive content from our own first - party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings . our search and news advertising business competes with google and a wide array of websites , social platforms like meta , and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users . operations we have regional operations service centers that support our operations , including customer contract and order processing , billing , credit and collections , information processing , and vendor management and logistics . the center in ireland supports the african , asia - pacific , european , and middle east regions ; and the centers in arlington , virginia , atlanta , georgia , charlotte , north carolina , fargo , north dakota , fort lauderdale , florida , redmond , washington , reno , nevada , and puerto rico support the american regions . in addition to our operations centers , we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions . we continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers , particularly given the growing demand for ai services . our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land , predictable energy , networking supplies , and servers , including graphics processing units ( “ gpus ” ) and other components . our devices are primarily manufactured by third - party contract manufacturers . for the majority of our products , we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements . however , some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers . extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand . part i item [X] research and development product and service development , and intellectual property we develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups . • cloud and ai – focuses on making it professionals , developers , partners , independent software vendors , and their systems more productive and efficient through development of azure ai platform and cloud infrastructure , server , database , crm , erp , software development tools and services ( including github ) , ai cognitive services , and other business process applications and services for enterprises . • strategic missions and technologies – focuses on incubating technical products and support solutions with transformative potential for the future of cloud computing and continued company growth across quantum computing , azure space & missions engineering , telecommunications , and microsoft federal sales and delivery . • experiences and devices – focuses on delivering high value end - user experiences across our products , services , and devices , including microsoft [XXX] , windows , microsoft teams , search ( including microsoft edge and bing chat ) and other advertising - based services , and the surface line of devices . • microsoft security – focuses on delivering a comprehensive portfolio of services that protect our customers ’ digital infrastructure through cloud platform and application security , data protection and governance , identity and network access , and device management . • technology and research – focuses on fundamental research , product and business incubations , and forward - looking ai innovations that span infrastructure , services , and applications . • linkedin – focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs and the way businesses hire , market , sell , and learn . • gaming – focuses on developing hardware , content , and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction . internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services . it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented . we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design . before releasing new software platforms , and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms , we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development , training , and testing . generally , we also create product documentation internally . we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways . we work actively in the u.s . and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright , trademark , trade secret , and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products , services , business plans , and branding . we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over [XX,XXX] u.s . and international patents issued and over [XX,XXX] pending worldwide . while we employ much of our internally - developed intellectual property in our products and services , we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees ’ products . from time to time , we enter into broader cross - license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents . we may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services . at times , we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective , such as promoting industry standards , advancing interoperability , supporting societal and/or environmental efforts , or attracting and enabling our external development community . our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations . while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services , we believe , based upon past experience and industry practice , such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms . we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products . part i item [X] investing in the future our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products , services , and experiences for our users , to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends , to enter new geographic and product markets , and to drive broad adoption of our products and services . we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company . based on our assessment of key technology trends , we maintain our long - term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies , tools , and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences , cloud computing , ai , devices , and operating systems . while our main product research and development facilities are located in redmond , washington , we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the u.s . and around the world . this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world . we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities , and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the company . in addition to our main research and development operations , we also operate microsoft research . microsoft research is one of the world ’s largest corporate research organizations , often working in close collaboration with top universities around the world , and is focused on advancing the state - of - the - art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines . our investment in fundamental research provides us a unique perspective on future trends and contributes to our innovation . distribution , sales , and marketing we market and distribute our products and services through the following channels : oems , direct , and distributors and resellers . our sales organization performs a variety of functions , including working directly with commercial enterprises and public - sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements ; managing oem relationships ; and supporting system integrators , independent software vendors , and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales , consulting , and fulfillment functions for our products and services . oems we distribute our products and services through oems that pre - install our software on new devices and servers they sell . the largest component of the oem business is the windows operating system pre - installed on devices . oems also sell devices pre - installed with other microsoft products and services , including applications such as office and the capability to subscribe to office [XXX] . there are two broad categories of oems . the largest category of oems are direct oems as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between microsoft and the oem . we have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational oems , including dell , hewlett - packard , lenovo , and with many regional and local oems . the second broad category of oems are system builders consisting of lower - volume pc manufacturers , which source microsoft software for pre - installation and local redistribution primarily through the microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with microsoft . direct many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through enterprise agreements and enterprise services contracts , with sales support from system integrators , independent software vendors , web agencies , and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ( “ enterprise agreement software advisors ” or “ esa ” ) . microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small , medium , and corporate customers , in addition to those offered through the reseller channel . a large network of partner advisors support many of these sales . we also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers , such as cloud services , search , and gaming , through our digital marketplaces and online stores . additionally , our microsoft experience centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries . part i item [X] distributors and resellers organizations also license our products and services indirectly , primarily through licensing solution partners ( “ lsp ” ) , distributors , value - added resellers ( “ var ” ) , and retailers . although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes , lsps are primarily engaged with large organizations , distributors resell primarily to vars , and vars typically reach small and medium organizations . esas are also typically authorized as lsps and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs . microsoft cloud solution provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services . we distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non - exclusive distributors , authorized replicators , resellers , and retail outlets . individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets . we distribute our devices through third - party retailers . we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support . our dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services . licensing options we offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services , on - premises software , and sa . we license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels . we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes . while these programs may differ in various parts of the world , generally they include those discussed below . sa conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period . it also provides support , tools , training , and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently . sa is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others . volume licensing programs enterprise agreement enterprise agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement . enterprise agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on - premises software organization - wide over a three - year period . organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses . sa is included . microsoft customer agreement a microsoft customer agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented , accepted , and stored through a digital experience . a microsoft customer agreement is a non - expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers over time , whether purchasing through a partner or directly from microsoft . microsoft online subscription agreement a microsoft online subscription agreement is designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to , activate , provision , and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web . the agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud - based services . microsoft products and services agreement microsoft products and services agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on - premises software as needed , with no organization - wide commitment , under a single , non - expiring agreement . organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses . sa is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses . part i item [X] open value open value agreements are a simple , cost - effective way to acquire the latest microsoft technology . these agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on - premises software over a three - year period . under open value agreements , organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and sa is included . select plus a select plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on - premises licenses at any affiliate or department level , while realizing advantages as one organization . organizations purchase perpetual licenses and sa is optional . partner programs the microsoft cloud solution provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value - added services offered by their systems integrator , managed services provider , or cloud reseller partner . partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision , manage , and support their customer subscriptions . the microsoft services provider license agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers . partners license software over a three - year period and are billed monthly based on consumption . the independent software vendor royalty program enables partners to integrate microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users . customers our customers include individual consumers , small and medium organizations , large global enterprises , public - sector institutions , internet service providers , application developers , and oems . our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers ; consequently , backlog is not significant . information about our executiv e officers our executive officers as of july [XX] , [XXXX] were as follows : # # table_start name age position with the company satya nadella chairman and

post on the social media channels listed on our investor relations website . part i item 1a","item 1a . ris k factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , cash flows , and the trading price of our common stock . strategic and competitive risks we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services , which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins . competition in the technology sector our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small , specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical , marketing , and financial resources . barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies , shifting user needs , and frequent introductions of new products and services . our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products , devices , and services that appeal to businesses and consumers . competition among platform - based ecosystems an important element of our business model has been to create platform - based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions . a well - established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users , application developers , and the platform provider that can accelerate growth . establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins . we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms . • a competing vertically - integrated model , in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services , has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers , tablets , phones , gaming consoles , wearables , and other endpoint devices . competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform , including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces . they may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer . we also offer some vertically - integrated hardware and software products and services . to the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins . • we derive substantial revenue from licenses of windows operating systems on pcs . we face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers . these devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform . users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers . even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer , the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our pc operating system platforms . competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our pc operating system margins . popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength . in addition , some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer ( “ oem ” ) partners , which may affect their commitment to our platform . • competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases . the variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions . users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms . to compete , we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality , security , customer appeal , and value . efforts to compete with competitors ’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins . competitors ’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives . part i item 1a business model competition companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models . • even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure- , platform- , and software - as - a - service business model , the license - based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue . we bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development , offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products . many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model . • we are investing in artificial intelligence ( “ ai ” ) across the entire company and infusing generative ai capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings . we expect ai technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market . we will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the ai capabilities , products , and services necessary to meet the needs of our customers . to compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change , potential regulatory developments , and public scrutiny . • other competitors develop and offer free applications , online services , and content , and make money by selling third - party advertising . advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost , competing directly with our revenue - generating products . • some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users , using open source ai models , and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services . these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products . some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products . the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes , price reductions , and/or increased operating costs , such as for research and development , marketing , and sales incentives . this may lead to lower revenue , gross margins , and operating income . our increasing focus on cloud - based services presents execution and competitive risks . a growing part of our business involves cloud - based services available across the spectrum of computing devices . our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best - in - class platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains . at the same time , our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud - based services for consumers and business customers . pricing and delivery models are evolving . devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user ’s choice of which cloud - based services to use . certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks . we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud - based strategies . the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment . we embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation . our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the internet of things ( “ iot ” ) , a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors , data , and computing capabilities , including ai . our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure , azure ai , and azure iot edge . we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives . besides software development costs , we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services . these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved . whether we succeed in cloud - based services depends on our execution in several areas , including : • continuing to bring to market compelling cloud - based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share . • maintaining the utility , compatibility , and performance of our cloud - based services on the growing array of computing devices , including pcs , smartphones , tablets , gaming consoles , and other devices , as well as sensors and other iot endpoints . • continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third - party developers . • ensuring our cloud - based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs . • making our suite of cloud - based services platform - agnostic , available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems , including those of our competitors . part i item 1a it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed . if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation , or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services , we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above . this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income . some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud - based services . these include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials , use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles , failure to pay for services accessed , or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks . if our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective , we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage . risks relating to the evolution of our business we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns . we will continue to make significant investments in research , development , and marketing for existing products , services , and technologies , including the windows operating system , microsoft [XXX] , bing , sql server , windows server , azure , office [XXX] , xbox , linkedin , and other products and services . in addition , we are focused on developing new ai platform services and incorporating ai into existing products and services . we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity , communication , and entertainment , including pcs , tablets , gaming devices , and hololens . investments in new technology are speculative . commercial success depends on many factors , including innovativeness , developer support , and effective distribution and marketing . if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value , they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades , unfavorably affecting revenue . we may not achieve significant revenue from new product , service , and distribution channel investments for several years , if at all . new products and services may not be profitable , and even if they are profitable , operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically . we may not get engagement in certain features , like microsoft edge , bing , and bing chat , that drive post - sale monetization opportunities . our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny . perceptions of mismanagement , driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences , could negatively impact product and feature adoption , product design , and product quality . developing new technologies is complex . it can require long development and testing periods . significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue . acquisitions , joint ventures , and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business . we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long - term business strategy . for example , in march [XXXX] we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc . for $ [X.X] billion , and in march [XXXX] we completed our acquisition of nuance communications , inc . for $ [XX.X] billion . in january [XXXX] we announced a definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard , inc . for $ [XX.X] billion . in january [XXXX] we announced the third phase of our openai strategic partnership . acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks , including that they do not advance our business strategy , that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment , that they raise new compliance - related obligations and challenges , that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees , business systems , and technology , that they distract management from our other businesses , or that announced transactions may not be completed . if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party , it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement . the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones , as well as acquired companies ’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance , privacy , and cybersecurity . it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies , or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected . these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements . part i item 1a if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired , we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings . we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions , which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles . we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable . we test goodwill for impairment at least annually . factors that may be a change in circumstances , indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable , include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization , reduced future cash flow estimates , and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate . we have in the past recorded , and may in the future be required to record , a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined , negatively affecting our results of operations . cybersecurity , data privacy , and platform abuse risks cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue , increased costs , liability claims , or harm to our reputation or competitive position . security of our information technology threats to it security can take a variety of forms . individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations , including state - sponsored organizations or nation - states , continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it . these actors may use a wide variety of methods , which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware , software , or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters , using social engineering techniques to induce our employees , users , partners , or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users ’ or customers ’ data , or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks . nation - state and state - sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks . nation - state attacks against us , our customers , or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict , such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine . inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data . for example , system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate . employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users ’ security or systems or reveal confidential information . malicious actors may employ the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware . cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex , increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them . we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods , which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time . cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers . breaches of our facilities , network , or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications , impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data , result in product development delays , compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position , result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets , subject us to ransomware attacks , require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks , or otherwise adversely affect our business . we are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider ’s customers , including us , through software updates . in addition , our internal it environment continues to evolve . often , we are early adopters of new devices and technologies . we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer - oriented technologies . increasing use of generative ai models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries . our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge , or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide . part i item 1a security of our products , services , devices , and customers ’ data the security of our products and services is important in our customers ’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on - premises environments . security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others . threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers . customers using our cloud - based services rely on the security of our infrastructure , including hardware and other elements provided by third parties , to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data . adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems , programs , and services , including many of ours , and we expect that to continue . in addition , adversaries can attack our customers ’ on - premises or cloud environments , sometimes exploiting previously unknown ( “ zero day ” ) vulnerabilities , such as occurred in early calendar year [XXXX] with several of our exchange server on - premises products . vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates , or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers ’ systems . adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation . adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users ’ accounts , including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords . inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access , and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer ’s use of our products or services . we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products . there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks . additionally , we are actively adding new generative ai features to our services . because generative ai is a new field , understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop ; features that rely on generative ai may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries . our customers operate complex it systems with third - party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years . they expect our products and services to support all these systems and products , including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards . as a result , we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product , service , standard , or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available . failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers ’ vulnerability to attack . further , customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology , and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies . in addition , we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services , including security default settings , as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of it operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults . cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised . we are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves . we are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection , tracking , and remediation . we may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack , especially where an attack involves on - premises software such as exchange server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers ’ computing environments . development and deployment of defensive measures to defend against security threats to our internal it systems , our cloud - based services , and our customers ’ systems , we must continuously engineer more secure products and services , enhance security , threat detection , and reliability features , improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others , develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed , maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network , products , and services , and provide security tools such as firewalls , anti - virus software , and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so . customers in certain industries such as financial services , health care , and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services . part i item 1a the cost of measures to protect products and customer - facing services could reduce our operating margins . if we fail to do these things well , actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services , data corruption issues , or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services , or to use competing products or services . customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack , which could delay adoption of additional products or services . customers , and third parties granted access to their systems , may fail to update their systems , continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support , or may fail timely to install or enable security patches , or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices . any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue . actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us . our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability , but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges . at times , to achieve commercial objectives , we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers . our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties . if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components , and if there is a security exploit targeting it , we could face increased costs , liability claims , reduced revenue , or harm to our reputation or competitive position . disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation . as we continue to grow the number , breadth , and scale of our cloud - based offerings , we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users . the continued occurrence of high - profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security . despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies , it is possible our security controls over personal data , our training of employees and third parties on data security , and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage . in addition , third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways . improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation , lead to legal exposure to customers or users , or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data , resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue . our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on - premises or , increasingly , in a cloud - based environment we host . government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders . in the u.s . and elsewhere , we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure . despite our efforts to protect customer and user data , perceptions that the collection , use , and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud - based solutions by consumers , businesses , and government entities . additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns , or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions , may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services . we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures . in certain cases , we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information . changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit , thus diminishing the value of our products and services . abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement . advertising , professional , marketplace , and gaming platform abuses for platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties , including github , linkedin , microsoft advertising , microsoft news , microsoft store , bing , and xbox , our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate . this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of ai technologies , dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users , or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends . preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful , adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements . part i item 1a other digital safety abuses our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law . we may not proactively discover such content due to scale , the limitations of existing technologies , and conflicting legal frameworks . when discovered by users and others , such content may negatively affect our reputation , our brands , and user engagement . regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted , and we expect this to continue . we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight , civil or criminal liability , or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations , adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements . the development of the iot presents security , privacy , and execution risks . to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge , we are developing products , services , and technologies to power the iot . the iot ’s great potential also carries substantial risks . iot products and services may contain defects in design , manufacture , or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes . an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware , sensors , processors , software , and firmware , several of which we may not develop or control . each layer , including the weakest layer , can impact the security of the whole system . many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched . iot solutions may collect large amounts of data , and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements . iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety . if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended , violate the law , or harm individuals or businesses , we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions . these risks , if realized , may increase our costs , damage our reputation or brands , or negatively impact our revenues or margins . issues in the development and use of ai may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability . we are building ai into many of our offerings , including our productivity services , and we are also making ai available for our customers to use in solutions that they build . this ai may be developed by microsoft or others , including our strategic partner , openai . we expect these elements of our business to grow . we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices , applications , and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives . as with many innovations , ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption , and therefore our business . ai algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed . datasets may be overbroad , insufficient , or contain biased information . content generated by ai systems may be offensive , illegal , or otherwise harmful . ineffective or inadequate ai development or deployment practices by microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of ai solutions or cause harm to individuals , customers , or society , or result in our products and services not working as intended . human review of certain outputs may be required . as a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies , our implementation of ai systems could subject us to competitive harm , regulatory action , legal liability , including under new proposed legislation regulating ai in jurisdictions such as the european union ( “ eu ” ) , new applications of existing data protection , privacy , intellectual property , and other laws , and brand or reputational harm . some ai scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society . if we enable or offer ai solutions that have unintended consequences , unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners , or are controversial because of their impact on human rights , privacy , employment , or other social , economic , or political issues , we may experience brand or reputational harm , adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements . part i item 1a operational risks we may have excessive outages , data losses , and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure . our increasing user traffic , growth in services , and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power . we spend substantial amounts to build , purchase , or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters . our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land , predictable energy , networking supplies , and servers , including graphics processing units ( “ gpus ” ) and other components . the cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors , including the transition to a clean energy economy , local and regional environmental regulations , and geopolitical disruptions . these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as bing , azure , microsoft account services , microsoft [XXX] , microsoft teams , dynamics [XXX] , onedrive , sharepoint online , skype , xbox , and outlook.com through the incorporation of ai features and/or functionality . we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back - end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users . maintaining , securing , and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex , and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks . it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve . inefficiencies or operational failures , including temporary or permanent loss of customer data , insufficient internet connectivity , insufficient or unavailable power supply , or inadequate storage and compute capacity , could diminish the quality of our products , services , and user experience resulting in contractual liability , claims by customers and other third parties , regulatory actions , damage to our reputation , and loss of current and potential users , subscribers , and advertisers , each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements . we may experience quality or supply problems . our hardware products such as xbox consoles , surface devices , and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design , manufacture , or associated software . we could incur significant expenses , lost revenue , and reputational harm as a result of recalls , safety alerts , or product liability claims if we fail to prevent , detect , or address such issues through design , testing , or warranty repairs . our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems . the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation . our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads . many of our products and services are interdependent with one another . each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues . any defects we do not detect and fix in pre - release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue , damage to our reputation , repair or remediation costs , delays in the release of new products or versions , or legal liability . although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability , there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge . there are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components . our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us . if components are delayed or become unavailable , whether because of supplier capacity constraint , industry shortages , legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources , or other reasons , we may not obtain timely replacement supplies , resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services . component shortages , excess or obsolete inventory , or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue . xbox consoles , surface devices , datacenter servers , and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain , resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins . legal , regulatory , and litigation risks government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products . government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s . and foreign competition laws . governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations , and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the eu , the u.s . , and china . some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti - competitive conduct . u.s . federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business . part i item 1a for example , the european commission ( “ the commission ” ) closely scrutinizes the design of high - volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products , such as file formats , programming interfaces , and protocols , available to other companies . flagship product releases such as windows can receive significant scrutiny under eu or other competition laws . our portfolio of first - party devices continues to grow ; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms . as a result , increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners , creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules . regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase . certain foreign governments , particularly in china and other countries in asia , have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property . competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses , reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them . new competition law actions could be initiated , potentially using previous actions as precedent . the outcome of such actions , or steps taken to avoid them , could adversely affect us in a variety of ways , including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets , decreasing the value of our assets , adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products , or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value . laws and regulations relating to anti - corruption and trade could result in increased costs , fines , criminal penalties , or reputational damage . the foreign corrupt practices act ( “ fcpa ” ) and other anti - corruption laws and regulations ( “ anti - corruption laws ” ) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees , vendors , or agents , and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls . from time to time , we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s . and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s . and our compliance with anti - corruption laws . periodically , we receive such reports directly and investigate them , and also cooperate with investigations by u.s . and foreign law enforcement authorities . an example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the eu whistleblower directive , initiated in [XXXX] , which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by eu member states . most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves . while we devote substantial resources to our u.s . and international compliance programs and have implemented policies , training , and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity , our employees , vendors , or agents may violate our policies . our failure to comply with anti - corruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties , criminal sanctions against us , our officers , or our employees , prohibitions on the conduct of our business , and damage to our reputation . increasing trade laws , policies , sanctions , and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the u.s . relating to trade and investment . economic sanctions in the u.s . , the eu , and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries . u.s . export controls restrict microsoft from offering many of its products and services to , or making investments in , certain entities in specified countries . u.s . import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries . supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny . periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict , such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine , may result in ( [X] ) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions , which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries , and ( [X] ) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers , partners , and us . non - compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm , operational delays , monetary fines , loss of revenues , increased costs , loss of export privileges , or criminal sanctions . part i item 1a laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs , legal claims , fines against us , or reputational damage . the growth of our internet- and cloud - based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries . legal requirements relating to the collection , storage , handling , and transfer of personal data continue to evolve . for example , while the eu - u.s . data privacy framework ( “ dpf ” ) has been recognized as adequate under eu law to allow transfers of personal data from the eu to certified companies in the u.s . , the dpf is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu to be uncertain . eu data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain u.s.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the u.s . in the eu and other markets , potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services . in addition , the eu general data protection regulation ( “ gdpr ” ) , which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu , imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data . more recently , the eu has been developing new requirements related to the use of data , including in the digital markets act , the digital services act , and the data act , that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services . engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects . we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations , or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive . compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them . if we fail to comply , or if regulators assert we have failed to comply ( including in response to complaints made by customers ) , it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions , which can result in significant monetary penalties , private lawsuits , reputational damage , blockage of international data transfers , and loss of customers . the highest fines assessed under gdpr have recently been increasing , especially against large technology companies . jurisdictions around the world , such as china , india , and states in the u.s . have adopted , or are considering adopting or expanding , laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection , handling , and transfer of personal data . our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services , including ai services , we deliver to customers , to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization , and to customer perceptions of quality . our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment . ongoing legal analyses , reviews , and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices , or relevant practices of other organizations , may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements , including data sovereignty and localization requirements , affecting the location , movement , collection , and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data . compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services , business practices , or internal systems that result in increased costs , lower revenue , reduced efficiency , or greater difficulty in competing with foreign - based firms . compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate . failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity , as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort . existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations . we are subject to a wide range of laws , regulations , and legal requirements in the u.s . and globally , including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings , and those that impose requirements related to user privacy , telecommunications , data storage and protection , advertising , and online content . laws in several jurisdictions , including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code , increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services . this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection , security , law enforcement surveillance , and other obligations . regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection , use , and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations , including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies . new environmental , social , and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure , reporting , and diligence requirements . legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop , implement , or secure our products and services . compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more . legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of ai and content moderation , which could increase costs or restrict opportunity . for example , in the eu , an ai act is being considered , and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our ai services in the european market . part i item 1a how these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear , subject to change over time , and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . in addition , governments ’ approach to enforcement , and our products and services , are continuing to evolve . compliance with existing , expanding , or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations . noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity . in addition , there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups , regulators , competitors , customers , and other stakeholders across many of these areas . if our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements , we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions . we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes . we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits . these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives , including major new product releases such as windows , ai services , significant business transactions , warranty or product claims , employment practices , and regulation . adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business . the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management ’s view of these matters may change in the future . a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable . our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties . we derive substantial revenue from government contracts . government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements . for instance , we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts , we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor , we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties , and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded . some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses . some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval , reductions , cancellations , or delays which could adversely impact public - sector demand for our products and services . these events could negatively impact our results of operations , financial condition , and reputation . we may have additional tax liabilities . we are subject to income taxes in the u.s . and many foreign jurisdictions . significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes . in the course of our business , there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain . for example , compliance with the [XXXX] united states tax cuts and jobs act ( “ tcja ” ) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company , the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements , and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions . as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja or possible future legislative changes , and as we gather more information and perform more analysis , our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements . we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions . although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable , tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken . in addition , economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult . we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years , with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing . the final resolution of those audits , and other audits or litigation , may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made . we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s . a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates , changes in our business or structure , or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company . in addition , changes in u.s . federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals , other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries , including in the u.s . , and changes in taxing jurisdictions ’ administrative interpretations , decisions , policies , and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements . part i item 1a intellectual property risks we face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed . protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult . similarly , the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights . changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents . additionally , licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations . finally , our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations . if we are unable to protect our intellectual property , our revenue may be adversely affected . source code , the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs , is critical to our business . if our source code leaks , we might lose future trade secret protection for that code . it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality , which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results . unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors . third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property . from time to time , others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights . to resolve these claims , we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available , stop selling or redesign affected products or services , or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers . adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing , marketing , and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies . we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk , and may continue to do so . general risks if our reputation or our brands are damaged , our business and operating results may be harmed . our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business . our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer , business , and public - sector customers . there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged . these include product safety or quality issues , our environmental impact and sustainability , supply chain practices , or human rights record . we may experience backlash from customers , government entities , advocacy groups , employees , and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions . damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from , among other things : • the introduction of new features , products , services , or terms of service that customers , users , or partners do not like . • public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy , data practices , or content . • data security breaches , compliance failures , or actions of partners or individual employees . the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood , speed , and magnitude of negative brand events . if our brands or reputation are damaged , it could negatively impact our revenues or margins , or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees . adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business . worsening economic conditions , including inflation , recession , pandemic , or other changes in economic conditions , may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue . if demand for pcs , servers , and other computing devices declines , or consumer or business spending for those products declines , our revenue will be adversely affected . our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network . oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution . the impact of economic conditions on our partners , such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor , oem , or retailer , could cause sales channel disruption . challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased . as a result , allowances for doubtful accounts and write - offs of accounts receivable may increase . part i item 1a we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings , types , and maturities . these investments are subject to general credit , liquidity , market , and interest rate risks , which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets . a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s . government securities . if global financial markets decline for long periods , or if there is a downgrade of the u.s . government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt , our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value , requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements . catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business . a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake , weather event , cyberattack , terrorist attack , pandemic , or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales , providing services , or performing other critical functions . our corporate headquarters , a significant portion of our research and development activities , and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle , washington area , and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california , both of which are seismically active regions . a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems , or the infrastructure or systems they rely on , such as power grids , could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations . providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements . abrupt political change , terrorist activity , and armed conflict , such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine , pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries , which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets . these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers . geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies , access to national , regional , and global markets , hiring , and profitability . geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public - sector customers . any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues . the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic , such as covid-19 , may adversely affect our operations , financial condition , and results of operations . the extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic ; governmental , business , and individuals ' actions in response to the pandemic ; and the impact on economic activity , including the possibility of recession or financial market instability . measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these risk factors . we may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business . if we are unsuccessful , it may adversely impact our revenues , cash flows , market share growth , and reputation . the long - term effects of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear . environmental regulations or changes in the supply , demand , or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services , including natural resources , necessary to run our business . changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud - based services . part i item 1a our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks . our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales . the global nature of our business creates operational , economic , and geopolitical risks . our results of operations may be affected by global , regional , and local economic developments , monetary policy , inflation , and recession , as well as political and military disputes . in addition , our international growth strategy includes certain markets , the developing nature of which presents several risks , including deterioration of social , political , labor , or economic conditions in a country or region , and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations . emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights , the environment , and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments . changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism , protectionism , or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs , local sourcing initiatives , and non - local sourcing restrictions , export controls , investment restrictions , or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries . disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services , impair our ability to operate in certain regions , or increase operating costs . although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure , significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s . dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations . our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees . our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds , experiences , and skill sets . the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive . maintaining our brand and reputation , as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive , are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees . we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws . changes to u.s . immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts . if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts , or if we can not retain highly skilled workers and key leaders , our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected . effective succession planning is also important to our long - term success . failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution . how employment - related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs . our global workforce is predominantly non - unionized , although we do have some employees in the u.s . and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils . in the u.s . , there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union . the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives . part i item 1b , [X] , [X] , [X]"

"" that unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history , inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots . it led us to be a pioneer in the development of ai and , since [XXXX] , an ai - first company . we continue this work under the leadership of alphabet and google ceo , sundar pichai . alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is google . we report google in two segments , google services and google cloud , and all non - google businesses collectively as other bets . alphabet 's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence . access and technology for everyone the internet is one of the world ’s most powerful equalizers ; it propels ideas , people , and businesses large and small . our mission to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in [XXXX] . since then , we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done . we are focused on building an even more helpful google for everyone , and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge , health , happiness , and success . google search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways , with trillions of searches on google every year . youtube provides people with entertainment , information , and opportunities to learn something new . google assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices , providing intelligent help throughout a person 's day , no matter where they are . google cloud helps customers solve today ’s business challenges , improve productivity , reduce costs , and unlock new growth engines . we are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users , partners , customers , and communities and have invested more than $ [XXX] billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts . making ai helpful for everyone ai is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world , and for our business . at google , we have been bringing ai into our products and services for more than a decade and making them available to our users . our journey began in [XXXX] , when machine learning was first incorporated into google search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web . today , ai in our products is [X] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end used by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in google search ; translation across [XXX] languages in google translate ; and organization , searching , and editing in google photos . large language models ( llms ) are an exciting aspect of our work in ai based on deep learning architectures , such as the transformer , a neural network architecture that we introduced in [XXXX] that helped with language understanding . this led to the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers , or bert , in [XXXX] that helped search understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before . google was a company built in the cloud , and we continue to invest in our google cloud offerings , including google cloud platform and google workspace , to help organizations stay at the forefront of ai innovation with our ai - optimized infrastructure , mature ai platform and world - class models , and assistive agents . we believe ai can solve some of the hardest societal , scientific and engineering challenges of our time . for example , in [XXXX] , google deepmind ’s alphafold system solved a [XX] - year - old protein folding challenge . since then , we have open - sourced to the scientific community [XXX] million of alphafold ’s protein structures which are used to work on everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic - eating enzymes . as another example , ai can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful information , predicting climate - related events , and optimizing climate action . using advanced ai and geospatial analysis , google research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real - time flooding information to communities and individuals . as ai continues to improve rapidly , we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we deliver on our mission to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful . with a bold and responsible approach , we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone . deliver the most advanced , safe , and responsible ai we aim to build the most advanced , safe , and responsible ai with models that are developed , trained , and rigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in ai technical infrastructure . in december [XXXX] , we launched gemini , our most capable and general model . it was built from the ground up to be multimodal , which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand , operate across , and combine different types of information , including text , code , audio , images , and video . our teams across alphabet will leverage gemini , as well as other ai models we have previously developed and announced , across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users , advertisers , partners , customers , and developers . we believe our approach to ai must be both bold and responsible . that means developing ai in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges , guided by our ai principles . we published these in [XXXX] , as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use , users , safety , and avoidance of harms above business considerations . while there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible , we believe it is possible — and in fact critical — to embrace that tension productively . enable organizations and developers to innovate on google cloud ai is not only a powerful enabler , it is also a major platform shift . globally , businesses from startups to large enterprises , and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation . that is why we are focused on making it easy and scalable for others to innovate , and grow , with ai . that means providing the most advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to google ’s latest ai models that have been rigorously tested in our own products . our vertex ai platform gives developers the ability to train , tune , augment , and deploy applications using generative ai models and services such as enterprise search and conversations . duet ai for google cloud provides pre - packaged ai agents that assist developers to write , test , document , and operate software . improve knowledge , learning , creativity , and productivity things that we now consider routine – like spell check , mobile check deposit , or google search , google translate , and google maps – all use ai . as ai continues to improve rapidly , we are focused on giving helpful features to our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful . while we have been integrating ai into our products for years , we are now embedding the power of generative ai to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done . for example , duet ai in google workspace helps users write , organize , visualize , accelerate workflows , and have richer meetings . bard allows users to collaborate with experimental ai with new features that include image capabilities , coding support , and app integration . dream screen , a new experimental feature in youtube , allows for the creation of ai - generated video or image backgrounds to shorts by typing an idea into a prompt . [X] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end we also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on google ads to find customers and grow their businesses — and we make that even easier with ai . with performance max , advertisers simply tell us their campaign goals and share their creative assets , and ai will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across all of google ’s properties , to meet their budget . product studio brings the benefits of ai to businesses of all sizes , helping them easily create uniquely - tailored imagery featuring their products — for free . additionally , we are experimenting with search and shopping ads that are directly integrated into the ai - powered snapshot and conversational mode in search generative experience . build the most helpful personal computing platforms and devices over the years , our pixel phones have incorporated ai compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it . our latest pixel devices were built around ai , bringing the best ai - assistive experiences to our users , such as best take , magic editor , and audio magic eraser . as we look ahead , we are designing our android and chrome operating systems with new ai - forward user experiences . moonshots many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done , making only incremental changes . this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time , especially in technology , where change tends to be revolutionary , not evolutionary . people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome , but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer , popular browser . our early investments in ai started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments . we continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term , most notably for the application of ai to our products and services , as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing . as we said in the original founders ' letter , we will not shy away from high - risk , high - reward projects that we believe in , as they are the key to our long - term success . privacy and security we make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products , users , and customers , even if there are near - term financial consequences . we do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default ; strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design ; and building easy - to - use settings that put people in control . we are continually enhancing these efforts over time , whether by enabling users to auto - delete their data , giving them tools , such as my ad center , to control their ad experience , or advancing anti - malware , anti - phishing , and password security features . google for reporting purposes google comprises two segments : google services and google cloud . google services serving our users we have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide . our product innovations are what make our services widely used , and our brand one of the most recognized in the world . google services ' core products and platforms include ads , android , chrome , devices , gmail , google drive , google maps , google photos , google play , search , and youtube , with broad and growing adoption by users around the world . our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than [XX] years ago . while google search started as a way to find web pages , organized into ten blue links , we have driven technical advancements and product innovations that have transformed google search into a dynamic , multimodal experience . we first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search , making it easier to navigate on smaller screens . as new types of content surfaced on the internet , universal search made it possible to search multiple content types , like news , images , videos , and more , to deliver rich , relevant results . the introduction of new search modalities , like voice and visual search , made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways . we took that a step further with multisearch , which lets people search with text and images at the same time . large language models like bert and multitask unified models , or mums , have made it possible to express more natural language queries , vastly improving the quality of results . each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for . this drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like google play and youtube . people are consuming many forms of digital content , including watching videos , streaming tv , playing games , listening to music , [X] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end reading books , and using apps . working with content creators and partners , we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content . fueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices . that is why we continue to invest in platforms like our android mobile operating system , chrome browser , and chrome operating system , as well as growing our family of devices . we see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people 's lives easier by combining the best of our ai , software , and hardware . this potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices , such as the new pixel [X] and pixel [X] pro , and the pixel watch [X] . creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long - term . how we make money we have built world - class advertising technologies for advertisers , agencies , and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses . our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats , and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies . ai has been foundational to our advertising business for more than a decade . products like performance max and product studio use the full power of our ai to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities . google services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on google search & other properties , youtube , and google network partners ' properties ( "" google network properties "" ) . we continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns . • performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers . performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results . our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text - based ads . • brand advertising helps enhance users ' awareness of and affinity for advertisers ' products and services , through videos , text , images , and other interactive ads that run across various devices . we help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand - building marketing campaigns . we have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web . we focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways , including filtering out invalid traffic , removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year , and closely monitoring the sites , apps , and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content . in addition , google services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising , including : • consumer subscriptions , which primarily include revenues from youtube services , such as youtube tv , youtube music and premium , and nfl sunday ticket , as well as google one ; • platforms , which primarily include revenues from google play from the sales of apps and in - app purchases ; and • devices , which primarily include sales of the pixel family of devices . google cloud through our google cloud platform and google workspace offerings , google cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption - based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure , platform , collaboration tools and other cloud services . customers use five key capabilities from google cloud . • ai - optimized infrastructure : provides open , reliable , and scalable compute , networking , and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere — on our cloud , at the edge , or in their data centers . it can be used to migrate and modernize it systems and to train and serve various types of ai models . • cybersecurity : helps customers detect , protect , and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats , with ai integrated to further strengthen security outcomes , prioritize which threats to investigate , and identify attack paths , as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats . • databases and analytics : provides a variety of different types of databases — relational , key - value , in - memory — to store and manage data for different types of applications . our data cloud also unifies data lakes , data warehouses , data governance , and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud . [X] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end • collaboration tools : google workspace and duet ai in google workspace provide easy - to - use , secure communication and collaboration tools , including apps like gmail , docs , drive , calendar , meet , and more . these tools enable secure hybrid and remote work , boosting productivity and collaboration . ai has been used in google workspace for years to improve grammar , efficiency , security , and more with features like smart reply , smart compose , and malware and phishing protection in gmail . duet ai in google workspace helps users write , organize , visualize , accelerate workflows , and have richer meetings . • ai platform and duet ai for google cloud : our vertex ai platform gives developers the ability to train , tune , augment , and deploy applications using generative ai models and services such as enterprise search and conversations . duet ai for google cloud provides pre - packaged ai agents that assist developers to write , test , document , and operate software . other bets across alphabet , we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change . alphabet ’s investment in the portfolio of other bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development , ranging from those in the r&d phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization . our goal is for them to become thriving , successful businesses . other bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors . while these early - stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty , some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries . revenues from other bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare - related services and internet services . competition our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies . we face formidable competition in every aspect of our business , including , among others , from : • general purpose search engines and information services ; • vertical search engines and e - commerce providers for queries related to travel , jobs , and health , which users may navigate directly to rather than go through google ; • online advertising platforms and networks ; • other forms of advertising , such as billboards , magazines , newspapers , radio , and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media , both online and offline ; • digital content and application platform providers ; • providers of enterprise cloud services ; • developers and providers of ai products and services ; • companies that design , manufacture , and market consumer hardware products , including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms ; • providers of digital video services ; • social networks , which users may rely on for product or service referrals , rather than seeking information through traditional search engines ; • providers of workspace communication and connectivity products ; and • digital assistant providers . competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses . for example , for advertising , competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining : • users , for whom other products and services are literally one click away , largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising , as well as the general usefulness , security , and availability of our products and services ; • advertisers , primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads , and ultimately customers , and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels ; and • content providers , primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base , our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising , and the terms of our agreements with them .

zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain , by [XXXX] . to accomplish this , we aim to reduce [XX] % of our combined scope [X] , scope [X] ( market - based ) , and scope [X] absolute emissions ( versus our [XXXX] baseline ) before [XXXX] , and plan to invest in nature - based and technology - based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions . we have formally committed to the science based targets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target . one of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy . since [XXXX] , we have matched [XXX] % of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual basis . however , because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the regions where we operate — and because of the variable supply of these resources — we still need to rely on carbon - emitting energy sources that power local grids . that is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon - free energy ( cfe ) on every grid where we operate by [XXXX] . achieving net - zero emissions and 24/7 cfe by [XXXX] are extremely ambitious goals . we also know that our path to net - zero emissions will not be easy or linear . some of our plans may take years to deliver results , particularly where they involve building new large - scale infrastructure with long lead times . so as our business continues to evolve , we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target . to benefit the people and places where we operate , we have set goals to replenish [XXX] % of the freshwater volume we consume , on average , across our offices and data centers by [XXXX] and to help restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate . we also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations , products , and supply chains . our circularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start , keeping materials in use for as long as possible , and promoting healthy materials — for our data centers , workplaces , and products . more information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports , including google ’s environmental report . the contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form [XX] -

climate change and sustainability ; competition ; consumer protection ; content moderation ; data privacy and security ; news publications ; and reporting on human capital and diversity , we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations , as well as related enforcement actions and investigations , being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world . our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could , individually or in the aggregate , increase our cost of doing business , make our products and services less useful , limit our ability to pursue certain business models , cause us to change our business practices , affect our competitive position relative to our peers , and/or otherwise harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . for additional information about government regulation applicable to our business , see item 1a risk factors ;

party digital advertising . failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . in addition , expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions . adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected , and may in the future affect , the demand for advertising , resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising , which could harm our financial condition and operating results . we face intense competition . if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users , customers , and other partners , we may not remain competitive , which could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive . our businesses face changing technologies , shifting user needs , and frequent introductions of rival products and services . to compete successfully , we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative , relevant and useful products , services , and technologies in a timely manner . as our businesses evolve , the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services . we must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and r&d , including through acquisitions , in order to enhance our technology , products , and services . we have many competitors in different industries . our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start - ups . some competitors have longer operating histories and well - established relationships in various sectors . they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position , including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic arrangements ; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure , r&d , and in talent ; initiating intellectual property and competition claims ( whether or not meritorious ) ; and continuing to compete for users , advertisers , customers , and content providers . further , discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny , thereby affording them competitive advantages . our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do . we are expanding our investment in ai across the entire company . this includes generative ai and continuing to integrate ai capabilities into our products and services . ai technology and services are highly competitive , rapidly evolving , and require significant investment , including development and operational costs , to meet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users . our ability to deploy certain ai technologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third - party equipment and technical infrastructure . additionally , other companies may develop ai products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost - effective to deploy . other companies may also have ( or in the future may obtain ) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent , limit , or interfere with our ability to make , use , or sell our own ai products and services . our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the evolving needs and desires of our users , advertisers , publishers , customers , and content providers . as new and existing technologies continue to develop , competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are , or [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end that are seen to be , substantially similar to or better than ours . these technologies could reduce usage of our products and services , and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services . competitors ’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users , advertisers , publishers , customers , and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results . our ongoing investment in new businesses , products , services , and technologies is inherently risky , and could divert management attention and harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses , products , services , and technologies in a wide range of industries beyond online advertising . the investments that we are making across our businesses , such as building ai capabilities into new and existing products and services , reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are helpful to users , advertisers , publishers , customers , and content providers . our investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and , in pursuing new strategies , we may incur unanticipated liabilities . innovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends . these endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties , including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations , different monetization models , and the use of alternative investment , governance , or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives . within google services , we continue to invest heavily in devices , including our smartphones , home devices , and wearables , which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services , rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors , increased market saturation in developed countries , short product life cycles , evolving industry standards , continual improvement in performance characteristics , and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses . there can be no assurance we will be able to provide devices that compete effectively . within google cloud , we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise - ready cloud services , including google cloud platform and google workspace , and we are advancing our ai platforms and models to support these tools and technologies . we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services , invest in cybersecurity , and hire talent , particularly to support and scale our sales force . at the same time , our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud - based services . pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving , and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives . further , our business with public sector customers may present additional risks , including regulatory compliance risks . for instance , we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews , and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal , financial , and/or reputational risks . evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments , build new products , and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries , and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements . within other bets , we are investing significantly in the areas of health , life sciences , and transportation , among others . these investment areas face intense competition from large , experienced , and well - funded competitors , and our offerings , many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies , may not be successful , or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability . in addition , new and evolving products and services , including those that use ai , raise ethical , technological , legal , regulatory , and other challenges , which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services . because all of these investment areas are inherently risky , no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation , financial condition , and operating results . our revenue growth rate could decline over time , and we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin in the future . our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors , including changes in the devices and modalities used to access our products and services ; changes in geographic mix ; deceleration or declines in advertiser spending ; competition ; customer usage and demand for our products ; decreases in our pricing of our products and services ; ongoing product and policy changes ; and shifts to lower priced products and services . in addition , we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors , such as an increase in the mix of lower - margin products and services , in particular from the continued expansion of our business into new fields , including products and services such as our devices , google cloud , and consumer subscription products , as well as significant investments in other bets , all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising . in particular , margins on our devices have had , and may continue to have , an adverse effect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales . we may also experience [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations , increasing competition , and increasing costs for many aspects of our business . further , certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue . we may also not be able to execute our efforts to re - engineer our cost base successfully or in a timely manner . due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business , our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance . for additional information , see trends in our business and financial effect and revenues and monetization metrics in part ii , item [X] of this annual report on form [XX] - k. our intellectual property rights are valuable , and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products , services , and brands as well as affect our ability to compete . our patents , trademarks , trade secrets , copyrights , and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us . various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights , as well as to our products , services , and technologies . for example , effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet . also , the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective . although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations , it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations . moreover , we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important . there is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable . we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets . the secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised , which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets . we also face risks associated with our trademarks . for example , there is a risk that the word “ google ” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “ search . ” some courts have ruled that "" google "" is a protectable trademark , but it is possible that other courts , particularly those outside of the u.s . , may reach a different determination . if this happens , we could lose protection for this trademark , which could result in other people using the word “ google ” to refer to their own products , thus diminishing our brand . any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete . also , protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming . any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results . our business depends on strong brands , and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users , advertisers , customers , content providers , and other partners . our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business . maintaining and enhancing the brands within google services , google cloud , and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users , advertisers , customers , content providers , and other partners . our brands have been , and may in the future be , negatively affected by a number of factors , including , among others , reputational issues , third - party content shared on our platforms , data privacy and security issues and developments , and product or technical performance failures . for example , if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers , or otherwise to adequately address user concerns , our users may lose confidence in our brands . furthermore , failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high - quality , trustworthy , innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings . we face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management , which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our services . we rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure , and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to assemble the devices and equipment . we also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and distribution of our products and services . our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms , or if those we engage fail to meet their [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end obligations ( whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons ) , or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them . we have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages , price increases , quality issues , and/or longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations , driven by raw material , component availability , manufacturing capacity , labor shortages , industry allocations , logistics capacity , inflation , foreign currency exchange rates , tariffs , sanctions and export controls , trade disputes and barriers , forced labor concerns , sustainability sourcing requirements , geopolitical tensions , armed conflicts , natural disasters or pandemics , the effects of climate change ( such as sea level rise , drought , flooding , heat waves , wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire prevention , and increased storm severity ) , power loss , and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers . some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources , and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption . a significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability . we may enter into long - term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions . we may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand , technological change , changed consumer preferences , quality , product recalls , and warranty issues . for instance , because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume - based pricing or minimum purchase requirements , if the volume of sales of our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets , we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating results . furthermore , certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply . our devices have had , and in the future may have , quality issues resulting from design , manufacturing , or operations . sometimes , these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers . if the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective or require a recall , it could harm our reputation , financial condition , and operating results . we require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and , where applicable , our company policies and practices , such as the google supplier code of conduct , regarding workplace and employment practices , data security , environmental compliance , and intellectual property licensing , but we do not control them or their practices . violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions , canceled orders , harm to key relationships , and damage to our reputation . their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims . interruption to , interference with , or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services , which could harm our reputation , financial condition , and operating results . the availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems . our systems are vulnerable to damage , interference , or interruption from modifications or upgrades , terrorist attacks , state - sponsored attacks , natural disasters or pandemics , geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts , export controls and sanctions , the effects of climate change ( such as sea level rise , drought , flooding , heat waves , wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire prevention , and increased storm severity ) , power loss , utility outages , telecommunications failures , computer viruses , software bugs , ransomware attacks , supply - chain attacks , computer denial of service attacks , phishing schemes , or other attempts to harm or access our systems . some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters . our data centers are also subject to break - ins , sabotage , and intentional acts of vandalism , and , in some cases , to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area . some of our systems are not fully redundant , and disaster recovery planning can not account for all eventualities . the occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic , closure of a facility , or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service . in addition , our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past , and may contain in the future , errors or vulnerabilities , which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems . any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing services , which could harm our reputation , financial condition , and operating results . our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income , and we plan to continue to grow internationally . international revenues accounted for approximately [XX] % of our consolidated revenues in [XXXX] . in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section , our international operations expose us to other risks , including the following : • restrictions on foreign ownership and investments , and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s . ; • sanctions , import and export controls , other market access barriers , political unrest , geopolitical tensions , changes in regimes , or armed conflict ( such as ongoing conflicts in the middle east and ukraine ) , any of which may affect our business continuity , increase our operating costs , limit demand for our products and services , limit our ability to source components or final products , or prevent or impede us from operating in certain jurisdictions , complying with local laws , or offering products or services ; • longer payment cycles in some countries , increased credit risk , and higher levels of payment fraud ; • an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation , new regulatory costs and challenges ( including new customer requirements ) , uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes , and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent ; • anti - corruption laws , such as the u.s . foreign corrupt practices act , and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials , violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties ; and • different employee / employer relationships , existence of works councils and differing labor practices , and other challenges caused by distance , language , local expertise , and cultural differences , increasing the complexity of doing business in multiple jurisdictions . because we conduct business in currencies other than u.s . dollars but report our financial results in u.s . dollars , we have faced , and will continue to face , exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure , significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s . dollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings . hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results . we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and , in some instances , our financial statements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies . the fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be , and certain investments have been in the past , negatively affected by liquidity , credit deterioration or losses , performance and financial results of the underlying entities , foreign exchange rates , changes in interest rates , including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates , the effect of new or changing regulations , the stock market in general , or other factors . we measure certain of our non - marketable equity and debt securities , certain other instruments including stock - based compensation awards settled in the stock of other bet companies , and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination , at fair value on a nonrecurring basis , which is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation . all gains and losses on non - marketable equity securities are recognized in oi&e , which increases the volatility of our oi&e . the unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value remeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments . as a result of these factors , the value of our investments could decline , which could harm our financial condition and operating results . risks related to our industry people access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences . if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces , our business could be harmed . people access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers , mobile phones , smartphones , laptops and tablets , video game consoles , voice - activated speakers , wearables ( including virtual reality and augmented reality devices ) , automobiles , and television - streaming devices . our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces . each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices , and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result . some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices . in addition , search queries may be undertaken via voice - activated search , apps , [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end social media or other platforms , which could harm our business . it is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services . we expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices . failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers , suppliers , distributors , developers , and users , or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms , could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities . issues in the development and use of ai may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure . our evolving ai - related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content , inaccuracies , discrimination , intellectual property infringement or misappropriation , defamation , data privacy , cybersecurity , and other issues . as a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies , our implementation of ai systems could subject us to competitive harm , regulatory action , legal liability ( including under new and proposed legislation and regulations ) , new applications of existing data protection , privacy , intellectual property , and other laws , and brand or reputational harm . some uses of ai will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society . in order to implement ai responsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects , we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant resources to develop , test , and maintain our products and services , but we may not be able to identify or resolve all ai - related issues , deficiencies , and/or failures before they arise . unintended consequences , uses , or customization of our ai tools and systems may negatively affect human rights , privacy , employment , or other social concerns , which may result in claims , lawsuits , brand or reputational harm , and increased regulatory scrutiny , any of which could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation , cause us to incur significant liability , and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services . computer viruses , software bugs or defects , security breaches , and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users ’ and customers ’ ability to use our products and services , harming our business and reputation . concerns about , including the adequacy of , our practices with regard to the collection , use , governance , disclosure , or security of personal data or other data - privacy - related matters , even if unfounded , could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change . our products and services involve the storage , handling , and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information . software bugs , theft , misuse , defects , vulnerabilities in our products and services , and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information , which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities , including regulatory fines and penalties , as well as reputational harm . additionally , our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies , and thus our technologies and software have contained , and are likely in the future to contain , undetected errors , bugs , and/or vulnerabilities . we continue to add new features involving ai to our offerings and internal systems , and features that rely on ai may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our and the market ’s understanding of ai - centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop . we have in the past discovered , and may in the future discover , some errors in our software code only after we have released the code . systems and control failures , security breaches , failure to comply with our privacy policies , and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure , seriously harm our reputation , brand , and business , and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers . such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services . while there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage , we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs , theft , misuse , and security vulnerabilities or breaches . we experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis . cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume , and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time . we have seen , and will continue to see , industry - wide software supply chain vulnerabilities , which could affect our or other parties ’ systems . we expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future . our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack . in addition , we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation - states and state - sponsored actors . these attacks may target us or our customers , particularly our public sector customers ( including federal , state , and local governments ) . geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts , such as the ongoing conflict in the middle east and ukraine , may increase these risks . we may experience security issues , whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance , system errors , or vulnerabilities in our or other parties ’ systems . while we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end time they occur and may remedy them quickly , there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal , financial , and reputational harm , including government inquiries , enforcement actions , litigation , and negative publicity . there is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate , even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence . because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to , disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target , even taking all reasonable precautions , including those required by law , we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures . further , if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data - security practices , fail to comply with our terms and policies , or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach , our users ’ data may be improperly accessed , used , or disclosed . if an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners ’ or service providers ’ security occurs , the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed , we could lose users and customers , our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised , and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks , including legal claims ( which may include class - action litigation ) and regulatory actions , fines , and penalties . any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . while we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities , including dedicated worldwide incident response teams , our response process , particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic , may not be adequate , may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident , may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm , or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident . as a result , we may suffer significant legal , reputational , or financial exposure , which could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . for additional information , see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘ risks related to laws , regulations , and policies ’ below . our ongoing investments in safety , security , and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data . in addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks , we are making significant investments in safety , security , and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties , including investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services . as a result of these efforts , we have in the past discovered , and may in the future discover , incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties . however , we may not have discovered , and may in the future not discover , all such incidents or activity , whether as a result of our data limitations , including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services , the scale of activity on our platform , or other factors , including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic , and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties . such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms , contracts or policies , the existence of false or undesirable user accounts , election interference , improper ad purchases , activities that threaten people ’s safety on- or off - line , or instances of spamming , scraping , or spreading disinformation . while we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly , there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal , financial , and reputational harm , including government inquiries and enforcement actions , litigation , and negative publicity . there is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate , even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence . we may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents . any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement , harm our reputation and brands , require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations , and adversely affect our business and financial results . any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries , which could result in monetary penalties and damages , divert management ’s time and attention , and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight . problematic content on our platforms , including low - quality user - generated content , web spam , content farms , and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services , which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services . we , like others in the industry , face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms , including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues , or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent . while we invest significantly in efforts to promote high - quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low - quality content and invalid traffic , we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end uniformly high - quality content . increased use of ai in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of abuse for bad actors . many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines , including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine 's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them . such efforts have affected , and may continue to affect , the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false , misleading , or undesirable content . although english - language web spam in our search results has been reduced , and web spam in most other languages is limited , we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings . although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms , there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful , and our users may have negative experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended , which may affect our users ' decisions in continuing to use our platforms . we also face other challenges from low - quality and irrelevant content websites , including content farms , which are websites that generate large quantities of low - quality content to help them improve their search rankings . we are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from low - quality websites , but we may not always be successful . we also face other challenges on our platforms , including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference , activities that threaten the safety and/or well - being of our users on- or off - line , and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation . if we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high - quality content , it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms , harming our financial condition and operating results . it may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions , which could result in monetary penalties and damages and divert management ’s time and attention . our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users . internet access providers may be able to restrict , block , degrade , or charge for access to certain of our products and services , which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers . our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet , and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively . currently , this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace , including incumbent telephone companies , cable companies , mobile communications companies , and government - owned service providers . some of these providers have taken , or have stated that they may take , measures that could degrade , disrupt , or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings , by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings , or by providing our competitors preferential access . some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers ; however , substantial uncertainty exists in the u.s . and elsewhere regarding such protections . for example , in [XXXX] the u.s . federal communications commission repealed net neutrality rules , which could permit internet access providers to restrict , block , degrade , or charge for access to certain of our products and services . in addition , in some jurisdictions , our products and services have been subject to government - initiated restrictions or blockages . these could harm existing key relationships , including with our users , customers , advertisers , and/or content providers , and impair our ability to attract new ones ; harm our reputation ; and increase costs , thereby negatively affecting our business . risks related to laws , regulations , and policies we are subject to a variety of new , existing , and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business , and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business . we are subject to numerous u.s . and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects , and our introduction of new businesses , products , services , and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations . in recent years , governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy , particularly in the areas of data privacy and security , competition , environmental , social and governance ( esg ) requirements , ai , and online content . the costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future . new or changing laws and regulations , or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices , have resulted in , and may continue to result in , less useful products and services , altered business practices , limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services , substantial costs , and civil or criminal liability . examples include laws and regulations regarding : • competition and technology platforms ’ business practices : laws and regulations focused on large technology platforms , including the digital markets act in the european union ( eu ) ; regulations and legal [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end settlements in the u.s . , south korea , and elsewhere that affect google play ’s billing policies , fees , and business model ; as well as litigation and new regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions . • ai : laws and regulations focused on the development , use , and provision of ai technologies and other digital products and services , which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions . for example , while legislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved , provisional political agreement on a proposed eu ai act was reached between co - legislators in december [XXXX] , including that specific transparency and other requirements would be introduced for general purpose ai systems and the models on which those systems are based . in addition , the white house 's executive order on the safe , secure , and trustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence devises a framework for the u.s . government , among other things , to regulate private sector use and development of certain foundation models . • data privacy , collection , and processing : laws and regulations further restricting the collection , processing , and/or sharing of user or advertising - related data , including privacy and data protection laws ; laws affecting the processing of children 's data ( as discussed further below ) , data breach notification laws , and laws limiting data transfers ( including data localization laws ) . • copyright and other intellectual property : copyright and related laws , including the eu directive on copyright in the digital single market and european economic area transpositions , which may introduce new licensing regimes , increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms , or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers , which may result in other regulatory actions . • content moderation : various laws covering content moderation and removal , and related disclosure obligations , such as the eu 's digital services act , florida ’s senate bill [XXXX] and texas ’ house bill [XX] , and laws and proposed legislation in singapore , australia , and the united kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms , which may make it harder for services like google search and youtube to detect and deal with low - quality , deceptive , or harmful content . • consumer protection : consumer protection laws , including the eu ’s new deal for consumers , which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations . in addition , the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations , as interpreted by courts , regulators , or administrative bodies , remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business . for example , we rely on statutory safe harbors , like those set forth in the digital millennium copyright act and section [XXX] of the communications decency act in the u.s . and the e - commerce directive in europe , to protect against liability for various linking , caching , ranking , recommending , and hosting activities . legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges . there are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the u.s . , eu , and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms . our development , use , and commercialization of ai products and services ( including our implementation of ai in our offerings and internal systems ) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability , including under specific legislation regulating ai , as well as new applications of existing data protection , cybersecurity , privacy , intellectual property , and other laws . we are and may continue to be subject to claims , lawsuits , regulatory and government investigations , enforcement actions , consent orders , and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . we are subject to claims , lawsuits , regulatory and government investigations , other proceedings , and orders involving competition , intellectual property , data privacy and security , tax and related compliance , labor and employment , commercial disputes , content generated by our users , goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms , personal injury , and other matters . we are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty , product liability , and consumer protection claims related to product defects , among other litigation , and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety , hazardous materials usage , other environmental effects , ai training , development , and commercialization , or service disruptions or failures . claims have been brought , and we expect will continue to be brought , against us for defamation , negligence , breaches of contract , copyright and trademark infringement , unfair competition , unlawful activity , torts , privacy rights violations , fraud , or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services , the design and effect of our products and services , or due to our involvement in hosting , transmitting , marketing , branding , or providing access to content created by third parties . [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end for example , in december [XXXX] , a california jury delivered a verdict in epic games v. google finding that google violated antitrust laws related to google play 's billing practices . the presiding judge will determine remedies in [XXXX] and the range of potential remedies vary widely . we plan to appeal . in addition , the u.s . department of justice , various u.s . states , and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business , including our advertising technologies and practices , the operation and distribution of google search , and the operation and distribution of the android operating system and play store . other regulatory agencies in the u.s . and around the world , including competition enforcers , consumer protection agencies , and data protection authorities , have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations . we are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate . various laws , regulations , investigations , enforcement lawsuits , and regulatory actions have involved in the past , and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties , injunctive relief , ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations , changes to our products and services , alterations to our business models and operations , including divestiture , and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences , all of which could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . any of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs , diversion of management resources , negative publicity and other harms to our business . estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex , fact - specific , and speculative process that requires significant judgment , and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our estimates . the resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in , and may in the future result in , additional substantial fines , penalties , injunctions , and other sanctions that could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . for additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject , see legal proceedings in part i , item [X] of this annual report on form [XX] - k. privacy , data protection , and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas . any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection , data usage , and encryption of user data . adverse legal rulings , legislation , or regulation have resulted in , and may continue to result in , fines and orders requiring that we change our practices , which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services , harming our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation , and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business . examples of these laws include : • the general data protection regulation and the united kingdom general data protection regulations , which apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or the united kingdom , respectively , or related to products and services that we offer to eu or the united kingdom users or customers , respectively , or the monitoring of their behavior in the eu or the uk , respectively . • various comprehensive u.s . state and foreign privacy laws , which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents ( including , in california , a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices ) and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data . • state laws governing the processing of biometric information , such as the illinois biometric information privacy act and the texas capture or use of biometric identifier act , which impose obligations on businesses that collect or disclose consumer biometric information . • various federal , state , and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to children and minors , including the collection and processing of children and minor ’s data . these include the children ’s online privacy protection act of [XXXX] , and the united kingdom age - appropriate design code , all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children . • the california internet of things security law , which regulates the security of data used in connection with internet - connected devices . • the eu ’s digital markets act , which will require in - scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies , among other changes . [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end further , we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether , how , and under what circumstances we can transfer , process and/or receive personal data , as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory authorities related to cross - border transfers of personal data . the validity of various data transfer mechanisms we currently rely upon remains subject to legal , regulatory , and political developments in both europe and the u.s . , which may require us to adapt our existing arrangements . we face , and may continue to face , intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend , result in significant damage awards or other costs ( including indemnification awards ) , and limit our ability to use certain technologies . we , like other internet , technology , and media companies , are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights , including patent , copyright , trade secrets , and trademarks . parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in u.s . and international courts and the u.s . international trade commission ( itc ) for exclusion and cease - and - desist orders . in addition , patent - holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us . as we continue to expand our business , the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products , services , and technologies . adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages , costly royalty or licensing agreements ( if licenses are available at all ) , or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the u.s . or elsewhere , including by preventing us from offering certain features , functionalities , products , or services in certain jurisdictions . they may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business . many of our agreements with our customers and partners , including certain suppliers , require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them , which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims . such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products , services , and technologies , as a result of injunctions or otherwise , which could result in loss of revenues and harm our business . moreover , intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers , when obtainable , may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims . furthermore , in connection with our divestitures , we have agreed , and may in the future agree , to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities , including those associated with intellectual property claims . regardless of their merits , intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle . to the extent such claims are successful , they could harm our business , including our product and service offerings , financial condition , and operating results . expectations relating to esg considerations could expose us to potential liabilities , increased costs , and reputational harm . we are subject to laws , regulations , and other measures that govern a wide range of topics , including those related to matters beyond our core products and services . for instance , new laws , regulations , policies , and international accords relating to esg matters , including sustainability , climate change , human capital , and diversity , are being developed and formalized in europe , the u.s . , and elsewhere , which may entail specific , target - driven frameworks and/or disclosure requirements . we have implemented robust esg programs , adopted reporting frameworks and principles , and announced a number of goals and initiatives . the implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments , and our goals , with all of their contingencies , dependencies , and in certain cases , reliance on third - party verification and/or performance , are complex and ambitious , and may change . we can not guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all , and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate . any failure , or perceived failure , by us to adhere to our public statements , comply fully with developing interpretations of esg laws and regulations , or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . we could be subject to changes in tax rates , the adoption of new u.s . or international tax legislation , or exposure to additional tax liabilities . we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the u.s . and numerous foreign jurisdictions . our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors , including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates , net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program , changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation , changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities , and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws , regulations , or accounting principles ( including changes in the interpretation of existing laws ) . further , if we are [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers , employees and partners as the withholding agent , we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties . we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities . as a result , we have received , and may in the future receive , assessments in multiple jurisdictions , on various tax - related assertions , such as transfer - pricing adjustments or permanent - establishment claims . any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial condition and operating results , require adverse changes to our business practices , or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries . in addition , the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty . although we believe our estimates are reasonable , the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made . furthermore , due to shifting economic and political conditions , tax policies , laws , or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results . for example , various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue - based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted taxes , which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes . the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) is coordinating negotiations among more than [XXX] countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies , including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of [XX] % . o ur effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years as a result of these changes . risks related to ownership of our stock we can not guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long - term stockholder value , and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves . we engage in share repurchases of our class a and class c stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the board of directors of alphabet . our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares . further , our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices , increase their volatility , reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time , which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock . the concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ’ ability to influence corporate matters . our class b stock has [XX] votes per share , our class a stock has one vote per share , and our class c stock has no voting rights . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , larry page and sergey brin beneficially owned approximately [XX.X] % of our outstanding class b stock , which represented approximately [XX.X] % of the voting power of our outstanding common stock . through their stock ownership , larry and sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval , including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions , such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets , for the foreseeable future . in addition , because our class c stock carries no voting rights ( except as required by applicable law ) , the issuance of the class c stock , including in future stock - based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs , could continue larry and sergey ’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders . the share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect larry and sergey ’s relative voting power . this concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders ’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial , which could reduce the market price of our class a stock and our class c stock . provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable . provisions in alphabet ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management . these provisions include the following : • our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation , death , or removal of a director . • our stockholders may not act by written consent , which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders ' meeting . • our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors . this limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates . [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end • stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders ’ meeting . these provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer 's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company . • our board of directors may issue , without stockholder approval , shares of undesignated preferred stock , which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us . as a delaware corporation , we are also subject to certain delaware anti - takeover provisions . under delaware law , a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of [XX] % or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or , among other things , the board of directors has approved the transaction . our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us . the trading price for our class a stock and non - voting class c stock may continue to be volatile . the trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile . in addition to the factors discussed in this report , the trading prices of our class a stock and class c stock have fluctuated , and may continue to fluctuate widely , in response to various factors , many of which are beyond our control , including , among others , the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world . these broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our class a stock and our class c stock , regardless of our actual operating performance . general risks our operating results may fluctuate , which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations . our operating results have fluctuated , and may in the future fluctuate , as a result of a number of factors , many outside of our control , including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events . as a result , comparing our operating results ( including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues ) on a period - to - period basis may not be meaningful , and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance . consequently , our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations . acquisitions , joint ventures , investments , and divestitures could result in operating difficulties , dilution , and other consequences that could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . acquisitions , joint ventures , investments , and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital , and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results . we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements , which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures . some of the areas where we face risks include : • diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic arrangements ; • failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis , if at all , from governmental authorities , or conditions placed upon approval that could , among other things , delay or prevent us from completing a transaction , or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction ; • failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations , technologies , services , and personnel ( including cultural integration and retention of employees ) and further develop the acquired business or technology ; • implementation of controls ( or remediation of control deficiencies ) , procedures , and policies at the acquired company ; • integration of the acquired company ’s accounting and other administrative systems , and the coordination of product , engineering , and sales and marketing functions ; • transition of operations , users , and customers onto our existing platforms ; • in the case of foreign acquisitions , the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic , currency , political , and regulatory risks associated with specific countries ; • failure to accomplish commercial , strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments , joint ventures , and other strategic arrangements ; • failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity ; [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end • liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition , including patent and trademark infringement claims , data privacy and security issues , violations of laws , commercial disputes , tax liabilities , warranty claims , product liabilities , and other known and unknown liabilities ; and • litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company , including claims from terminated employees , customers , former stockholders , or other third parties . our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits , incur unanticipated liabilities , and harm our business generally . our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities , the incurrence of debt , contingent liabilities , or amortization expenses , or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long - lived assets , and restructuring charges , any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results . also , the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize . in connection with our divestitures , we have agreed , and may in the future agree , to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities , which could harm our financial condition and operating results . we rely on highly skilled personnel and , if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel , hire qualified personnel , or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture , we may not be able to grow or operate effectively . our performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as well as members of our senior management team . for instance , sundar pichai is critical to the overall management of alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology , maintaining our culture , and setting our strategic direction . our ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify , hire , develop , motivate , and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization . competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense , and certain of our competitors have directly targeted , and may continue to target , our employees . in addition , our compensation arrangements , such as our equity award programs , may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees . restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire , mobilize , or retain some of our global talent . all of our executive officers and key employees are at - will employees , and we do not maintain any key - person life insurance policies . in addition , we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation , creativity , and teamwork . as our organization grows and evolves , we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever - changing circumstances , such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic , and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture . under our hybrid work models , we may experience increased costs and/or disruption , in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture ."

[XXXX] vs. [XXXX] [XXXX] revenue was $ [XX.X] billion , down $ [XX.X] billion , or [XX] % , from [XXXX] . ccg revenue was down [XX] % from [XXXX] due to lower notebook and desktop volume in the consumer and education market segments , and lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our [X] g smartphone modem business and lower demand for our wireless and connectivity products . notebook volume decreased , driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments , while asps increased due to the resulting product mix . desktop volume decreased , driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments while asps increased due to an increased mix of commercial products . dcai revenue decreased [XX] % from [XXXX] due to lower server demand from enterprise customers , and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening data center market . the decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from our fpga business . server asps decreased due to customer and product mix . nex revenue increased [XX] % from [XXXX] , driven by higher ethernet asps and increased demand for [X] g products , partially offset by lower demand for network xeon . mobileye revenue increased [XX] % from [XXXX] , primarily driven by higher demand for eyeq products and mobileye supervision systems . the decrease in our "" all other "" revenue was due to revenue from the divested nand memory business of $ [X.X] billion recognized in [XXXX] , for which historical results are recorded in “ all other , ” and $ [XXX] million of revenue recognized in [XXXX] from a prepaid customer supply agreement . incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes , particularly in ccg , contributed approximately $ [X.X] billion to our revenue during q4 [XXXX] . # # table_start md&a # # table_end gross margin we derived most of our overall gross margin in [XXXX] from the sale of products in the ccg and dcai operating segments . our overall gross margin dollars in [XXXX] decreased by $ [X.X] billion , or [XX] % , compared to [XXXX] , and in [XXXX] decreased by $ [XX.X] billion , or [XX] % , compared to [XXXX] . # # table_start gross margin $ b ( percentages in chart indicate gross margin as a percentage of total revenue ) # # table_end # # table_start ( in millions ) $ [XX,XXX] [XXXX] gross margin ( [X,XXX] ) lower product margin primarily due to lower server revenue ( [X,XXX] ) lower product margin driven by lower revenue across nex product lines ( [X,XXX] ) lower product margin primarily from lower notebook and desktop revenue ( [X,XXX] ) higher unit cost primarily from increased mix of intel [X] products ( [XXX] ) higher period charges related to excess capacity charges [X,XXX] lower period charges driven by the sell -

in - progress assets are placed into service , we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and , ultimately , cost of sales . to the extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset these production costs , our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected . additionally , we could incur asset impairments on property , plant , and equipment assets if our idm [X.X] strategy is not successful . effective january [XXXX] , we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from [X] to [X] years . when compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of [XXXX] , we estimate total depreciation expense in [XXXX] was reduced by $ [X.X] billion . we estimate this change resulted in an approximately $ [X.X] billion increase to gross margin , $ [XXX] million decrease in r&d expenses , and $ [X.X] billion decrease in ending inventory values . these estimates are based on the assets in use and under construction as of the beginning of [XXXX] and are calculated at that point in time . most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life change is included in overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into service after this calculation was performed , for which such costs are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process . as a result , the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is included in our [XXXX] operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year - over - year basis . operating expenses total r&d and mg&a expenses for [XXXX] were $ [XX.X] billion , down [XX] % compared to [XXXX] . these expenses represent [XX.X] % of revenue for [XXXX] and [XX.X] % of revenue for [XXXX] . in support of our strategy , we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap . this requires increased investments in r&d and focused efforts to attract and retain talent . we have implemented certain cost -

us jurisdictions . our benefit from income taxes increased in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] primarily due to a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non - us jurisdictions . the [XXXX] shift in income was attributable to the [XXXX] tax costs associated with the gains recognized from the equity sale of mcafee and the divestiture of our nand memory business . our effective tax rate decreased in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] , primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non - us jurisdictions and a change in tax law from [XXXX] tax reform related to the capitalization of r&d expenses that went into effect in january [XXXX] . in [XXXX] we recognized a benefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in [XXXX] as the higher proportion of our income being taxed in non - us jurisdictions and the change in tax law from [XXXX] tax reform were only partially offset by the tax costs associated with the gains recognized from the equity sale of mcafee and the divestiture of our nand memory business . in [XXXX] the oecd announced an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting including pillar two model rules defining the global minimum tax , which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of [XX] % . subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued . many non - us tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the pillar two model rules beginning in [XXXX] ( including the european union member states ) with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years . we are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact pillar two model rules in the non - us tax jurisdictions we operate in . liquidity and capital resources we believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next [XX] months and in the longer term . cash generated by operations , supplemented by our total cash and investments [X] , is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements . these sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other smart capital initiatives that we have undertaken . our short - term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test , including investments in our process technology roadmap ; working capital requirements ; and potential and pending acquisitions , strategic investments , and dividends . our long - term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology . these plans include expanding existing operations in arizona , ireland , israel , new mexico , and oregon , and investing in new leading - edge manufacturing facilities in germany and ohio . we also expect to continue to benefit from government incentives and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our investments . conversely , incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements . we expect our planned capital investments to continue to put pressure on our adjusted free cash flow in the short term . as we invest in multiple expansions , we expect our capital expenditures to continue to be higher than historical levels for the next several years . we expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had commitments for capital expenditures of $ [XX.X] billion for [XXXX] and had $ [X.X] billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , other purchase obligations and commitments in [XXXX] under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $ [X.X] billion , with an additional $ [X.X] billion committed in the long term . we have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business , beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services . for example , see "" note [XX] : commitments and contingencies "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our lease obligations , which include supply agreements structured as leases ; "" note [X] : income taxes "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our tax obligations , including impacts from tax reform enacted in [XXXX] for the one - time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings ; and "" note [XX] : borrowings "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our debt obligations . the expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information . timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different , depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services , or changes to agreed - upon amounts for some obligations . in addition , some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above . for example , some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons . # # table_start md&a # # table_end when assessing our current sources of liquidity , we include our total cash and investments [X] as follows : # # table_start ( in millions ) dec [XX] , [XXXX] dec [XX] , [XXXX] cash and cash equivalents $ [X,XXX] $ [XX,XXX] short -

recourse factoring arrangements with third - party financial institutions . under our commercial paper program , we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ [XX.X] billion and , as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding . during [XXXX] , we issued a total of $ [XX.X] billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes , including , but not limited to , refinancing our outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures . we also amended both our five - year $ [X.X] billion variable - rate revolving credit facility agreement , extending that maturity date by one year to march [XXXX] , and our [XXX] - day $ [X.X] billion credit facility agreement , extending the maturity date to march [XXXX] . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities . in q1 [XXXX] , we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock . this dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation , is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy , and is designed to position us to create long - term value . in january [XXXX] , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $ [X.XXX] per share on the company 's common stock , which will be payable on march [X] , [XXXX] to stockholders of record as of february [X] , [XXXX] . future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our board of directors . our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity , among other factors , for our strategic business requirements . in [XXXX] these actions included , among others , negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions , adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections , managing inventory levels and purchasing practices , and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non - recourse basis to third - party financial institutions . while such actions have benefited , and may further benefit , cash flow in the near term , we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these actions reverse or normalize . our cash flows for each period were as follows : # # table_start years ended ( in millions ) dec [XX] , [XXXX] dec [XX] , [XXXX] dec [XX] , [XXXX] net cash provided by operating activities $ [XX,XXX] $ [XX,XXX] $ [XX,XXX] net cash used for investing activities ( [XX,XXX] ) ( [XX,XXX] ) ( [XX,XXX] ) net cash provided by ( used for ) financing activities [X,XXX] [X,XXX] ( [X,XXX] ) net increase ( decrease ) in cash and cash equivalents $ ( [X,XXX] ) $ [X,XXX] $ ( [X,XXX] ) # # table_end operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non - cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . for [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] , the $ [X.X] billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower [XXXX] net income after adjusting for non - cash items , partially offset by [XXXX] cash - favorable working capital changes compared to [XXXX] . for [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] , the $ [XX.X] billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower [XXXX] net income after adjusting for non - cash items , including the gain on the sale of mcafee and the pre - tax gain from the divestiture of our nand business , partially offset by [XXXX] cash - favorable working capital changes compared to [XXXX] . # # table_start md&a # # table_end investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures ; investment purchases , sales , maturities , and disposals ; proceeds from capital - related government incentives ; and proceeds from divestitures . our capital expenditures were $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] ( $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] and $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] ) . the increase in cash used for investing activities in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] was primarily due to a lack of proceeds from the divestiture of our nand business and from the sale of our remaining mcafee share that occurred in [XXXX] , lower maturities and sales of short - term investments , and increased capital expenditures . these unfavorable cash flow impacts during [XXXX] were partially offset by higher [XXXX] proceeds from capital - related government incentives and by other cash favorable investment activities , including lower acquisitions during [XXXX] . the decrease in cash used for investing activities in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] was primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short - term investments , proceeds from the divestiture of our nand business , and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of mcafee , partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures . financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders , issuance and repayment of short - term and long - term debt , and proceeds from partner contributions and equity - related issuances . the increase in cash provided by financing activities in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] was primarily due to higher debt issuances along with lower repayment of long - term debt , decreased dividend payments to stockholders , and increased proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares , partially offset by commercial paper issuances in [XXXX] that were subsequently repaid in [XXXX] . our total dividend payments were $ [X.X] billion in [XXXX] , compared to $ [X.X] billion in [XXXX] . we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past [XXX] quarters . cash provided by financing activities in [XXXX] compared to cash used for financing activities in [XXXX] was primarily due to higher commercial paper and debt issuances , our [XXXX] curtailment of common stock repurchases , proceeds from the mobileye ipo , and partner contributions for joint investments , partially offset by higher [XXXX] debt repayments . critical accounting estimates the methods , assumptions , and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . we consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if : ( [X] ) we must make assumptions that are uncertain when the judgment is made , and ( [X] ) changes in the estimate assumptions , or selection of a different estimate methodology , could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements . while we believe that our estimates , assumptions , and judgments are reasonable , they are based on information available when the estimate was made . refer to "" note [X] : accounting policies "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates , which are as follows , as well as our significant accounting policies : ▪ inventories — the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory , net of factory excess capacity costs . inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering forecasted future demand and market conditions ; ▪ long - lived assets — the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment and evaluation of useful lives of property , plant , and equipment ; identified intangibles ; and impairment of goodwill , including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units ; and ▪ loss contingencies — the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable . # # table_start md&a # # table_end non - gaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with us gaap , this document contains references to the non - gaap financial measures below . we believe these non - gaap financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance , enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance , and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance . these non - gaap financial measures are used in our performance - based rsus and our cash bonus plans . our non - gaap financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items , as well as the related income tax effects . beginning in [XXXX] , income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long - term projected tax rate of [XX] % across all adjustments . we project this long - term non - gaap tax rate on an annual basis using a five - year non - gaap financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment . the projected non - gaap tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure , our tax positions in various jurisdictions , and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate . this long - term non - gaap tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons , including the rapidly evolving global tax environment , significant changes in our geographic earnings mix , or changes to our strategy or business operations . management uses this non - gaap tax rate in managing internal short- and long - term operating plans and in evaluating our performance ; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance . prior - period non - gaap financial measures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this updated approach . our non - gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for , or superior to , financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap , and the financial results calculated in accordance with us gaap and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated . # # table_start non -

gaap measures . while the second closing of the sale is still pending and subject to closing conditions , we deconsolidated this business in q1 [XXXX] and management does not view the historical results of the business as a part of our core operations . we believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view , through the eyes of management , of our core business model and how management currently evaluates core operational performance . in making these adjustments , we have not made any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or other financial statement amounts . acquisition - related adjustments amortization of acquisition - related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology , brands , and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations . charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and mg&a in our us gaap financial statements . amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset , and thus are generally recorded over multiple years . we exclude amortization charges for our acquisition - related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions . these adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends . share - based compensation share - based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans . we exclude charges related to share - based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because we believe these adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance . we believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view , through the eyes of management , of our core business model , how management currently evaluates core operational performance , and additional means to evaluate expense trends , including in comparison to other peer companies . # # table_end # # table_start md&a # # table_end # # table_start non -

gaap measures because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past operating results and provides a useful evaluation of our current operating performance . optane inventory impairment a charge in [XXXX] as we initiated the wind - down of our intel optane memory business . we exclude these impairments for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because these charges do not reflect our current operating performance . this adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results . restructuring and other charges restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements . other charges may include periodic goodwill and asset impairments , certain pension charges , and costs associated with restructuring activity . [XXXX] includes a benefit as a result of developments in the vlsi litigation in q4 [XXXX] , an ec - imposed fine , and a fee related to the termination of our agreement to acquire tower . [XXXX] includes a benefit related to the annulled ec fine and [XXXX] includes a charge related to the vlsi litigation . we exclude restructuring and other charges , including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods , for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance . these adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends . ( gains ) losses on equity investments , net ( gains ) losses on equity investments , net consists of ongoing mark - to - market adjustments on marketable equity securities , observable price adjustments on non - marketable equity securities , related impairment charges , and the sale of equity investments and other . we exclude these non - operating gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because it provides better comparability between periods . the exclusion reflects how management evaluates the core operations of the business . ( gains ) losses from divestiture ( gains ) losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture , or over a specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the time of closing . based on our ongoing obligation under the nand wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first closing of the sale of our nand memory business on december [XX] , [XXXX] , a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between first and second closing . we exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance . these adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results . adjusted free cash flow we reference a non - gaap financial measure of adjusted free cash flow , which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity , capital resources , and quality of earnings . adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for ( [X] ) additions to property , plant , and equipment , net of proceeds from capital - related government incentives and partner contributions , ( [X] ) payments on finance leases , and ( [X] ) proceeds from the mcafee equity sale in [XXXX] . this non - gaap financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business . since the [XXXX] divestiture , mcafee equity distributions and sales contributed to prior operating and free cash flow , and while the mcafee equity sale in q1 [XXXX] would have typically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as an equity sale , we believe including the sale proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better , more consistent comparison to current and past presentations of liquidity . total cash and investments total cash and investments is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity , which include cash and cash equivalents , short - term investments , and loans receivable and other . this non - gaap measure is helpful in understanding our capital resources and liquidity position . # # table_end # # table_start md&a # # table_end following are the reconciliations of our most comparable us gaap measures to our non -

k , including in the md&a and financial statements and supplemental details sections . we are in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry . the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological , geopolitical , and market developments ; changes in industry standards ; changes in customer and end - user needs , expectations , and preferences ; and frequent product introductions and improvements . when we do not anticipate or respond to these developments , our competitive position can weaken , and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete . our competitive environment has intensified in recent years , and we expect it to continue to do so in the future . if we are not able to compete effectively , or if our foundry strategy is unsuccessful , our financial results will be adversely affected , including through reduced revenue and gross margin , and we may be required to accelerate the write - down of the value of certain assets . we face intense competition across our product portfolio . our competitors include companies offering platform products , such as amd and qualcomm ; accelerator products such as gpus , including those offered by nvidia ; other accelerator products such as asics , application - specific standard products , and fpgas ; memory and storage products ; connectivity and networking products ; and other semiconductor products . some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms , such as the arm architecture * , and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale . for example , arm - based products are being used in pcs and servers , which could lead to further development and growth of the arm ecosystem . we also compete with internally developed semiconductors from oems , cloud service providers , and others , some of whom are customers . some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads . for example , in [XXXX] , apple introduced pc products utilizing its own internally developed arm - based semiconductor designs in place of our client cpus , and we face increasing competition from apple 's products and ecosystem . most of our competitors rely on third - party foundries , such as tsmc or samsung , for the manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products . manufacturing process and assembly and test improvements introduced by such foundries have contributed , and may continue to contribute , to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors . our process technology roadmap to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by [XXXX] is subject to a number of risks , and we could fail to realize our goals , including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps , changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology , and the risks described in the risk factor "" the development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties . "" as an idm , we have higher capital expenditures and r&d spending than many of our fabless competitors due to the high ongoing investments required to maintain leading - edge process technology and manufacturing capacity . we also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through , for example , acquisitions or business collaborations , as well as new entrants , including in china , which could have a significant impact on our competitive position . for example , we could face increased competition as a result of china 's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains . our products compete based on a number of factors , including performance , energy efficiency , ease - of - integration , ease - of - use , innovative design , features , workload optimization , price , quality , reliability , security , software ecosystem and developer support , time - to - market , reliable product roadmap execution , brand recognition , customer support and customization , and availability . the importance of these factors varies by product and market segment . to the extent our products do not meet our customers ' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape , our business and results of operations can be harmed . introduction of competitive new products and technologies , aggressive pricing , and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products , exert downward pricing pressure on our products , and adversely affect our business . for example , our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment . further , our dcai revenue , platform asps and market share were negatively impacted by the competitive environment and the shift of customer spend towards gpus during the past few years . additionally , a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred in recent years , and more could occur in the future . consolidation could also lead to fewer customers , partners , or suppliers , any of which could negatively affect our financial results . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we have limited experience in the highly competitive and capital - intensive third - party foundry business . as we pursue our strategy to establish ifs as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others , we will face intense competition from well - established competitors such as tsmc , samsung , global foundries ( gf ) , united microelectronics corporation ( umc ) , and semiconductor manufacturing international corporation ( smic ) . to succeed , we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time - to - market of manufacturing technology ; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance , performance per watt , and density ; multi - chip packaging ; system integration ; manufacturing capacity ; price ; margin ; ease of use ; quality ; yields ; customer satisfaction ; and ecosystem support . building and maintaining a competitive foundry business requires high ongoing investments to maintain leading - edge process technology and manufacturing capacity , which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped . moreover , many of the largest potential ifs customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own . as a result , our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality information , intellectual property , and foundry capacity , among other competitive concerns , to attract and retain such customers . our limited third - party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading - edge and legacy nodes . our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of , regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon , and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities . our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor , materials , and equipment . increasing demand for such sources , including from other foundries ; supply constraints , labor shortages , and other adverse market conditions ; issues with permits or approvals ; on - site incidents ; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects , as well as legal and reputational harm . these significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain . we are making significant , long - term and inherently risky investments in r&d and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return . to compete successfully , we must maintain an effective r&d program , develop new products and manufacturing processes , improve our products and processes , and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities , all ahead of competitors and market demand . the r&d efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies . we incurred r&d expenses of $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] , $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] , and $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] . we are focusing our r&d efforts across several key areas , including process and packaging technology , our xpu products and features , ai , and software . these include ambitious initiatives , such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies , or nodes , in four years and our unified oneapi portfolio of developer tools . our investments are typically long - term and , even where successful , often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years . we can not guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate , including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors . for example , we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our [XX] nm process technology , and during [XXXX] , we announced that our then [X] nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations . in such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance , performance per watt , transistor density , die utilization , core counts , and/or new features such as optimizations for ai and other workloads , with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency , relative to competing foundry processes , we have faced and will face cost , product performance , and time - to - market disadvantages relative to our competitors and adverse impacts to our financial condition as a result of higher operating costs , including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity , higher leverage and borrowing costs , and pressure on our credit ratings . further , we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products , including as a result of bugs , late changes to features due to customer requests , or other design challenges . for example , in [XXXX] , we announced that the release of intel 's 4th gen intel xeon scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of [XXXX] to the second half of [XXXX] . to the extent our r&d efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance , performance per watt , die utilization , and core counts , and/or with new features such as optimizations for ai and other workloads , our competitive position can be harmed . we have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products , in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package . this approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability , particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies , several of which are novel , have a limited manufacturing history , and/or have increased costs . delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products . for example , adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional r&d expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end the investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical levels . in recent years , the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utilizing leading process technologies , including as a result of the use of euv photolithography tools . our ownership and operation of such high - tech fabrication facilities , and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand , has resulted and will continue to result in our incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term . such capital outlays and costs include those related to utilization of existing facilities , facility construction and equipment , r&d , and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce . to the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver or demand for our products , foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately , our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure , which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors . we could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charges , which would also lower our gross margin and operating income . to the extent the demand decrease is prolonged , our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized , and we may be required to write down our long - lived assets , which would increase our expenses . we may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under - used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation . as we continue to make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our idm [X.X] strategy , these underutilization risks may be heightened . conversely , at times , demand may increase or we may fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded . to the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough , we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand , which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share , legal claims , and/or damage to customer relationships . the development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties . we are continually engaged in the development of next - generation technologies . forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging , and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process , challenges in using new materials or new production equipment , and other issues . diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time , as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes , and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially anticipated . we are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes . we experienced significant delays in implementing our [XX] nm process technology , and in [XXXX] , we encountered a defect mode in the development of our then [X] nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations . in [XXXX] , intel 's 4th gen intel xeon scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time . these delays have allowed competitors using third - party foundries , such as tsmc , to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us , including improvements in performance , energy efficiency , and other features , which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products . because of these prior delays in our process technologies , we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products . our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks , including difficulties in designing and developing next - generation process and packaging technologies , and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance . we can not guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next - generation process technologies , including the expected cost , performance , power , and density advantages , or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and r&d investments , particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive . in such circumstances , we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities , increasing our expenses . risks inherent in the development of next - generation process technologies include production timing delays , lower - than - anticipated manufacturing yields , longer manufacturing throughput times , failure to achieve expected performance , power , and area improvements , and product defects and errata ( deviations from published specifications ) . production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows , which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships . furthermore , when the introduction of next - generation process nodes is delayed , adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products , manufacturing supply constraints , and increased product costs . lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times , compared to previous process nodes , can increase our product costs , adversely affect our gross margins , and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints . a new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields , and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes . as the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk , our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata , which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products . our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges , particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies , including third - party foundries ' process technologies . to combine components in a single package , they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities , while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields , throughput times , and capacity constraints . we may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others . delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product . in addition , the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues . to the extent we are unable to manage these risks , our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end from time to time , disruptions in the production process result from errors ; defects in materials ; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses ; interruptions in our supply of materials , resources , or production equipment ; adverse changes in equipment productivity ; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents , maintenance issues , power interruptions , equipment malfunctions , or unsafe working conditions — all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in production timing delays . production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand , which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations . our implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses , products , and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed . our idm [X.X] strategy requires implementation of new business strategies , as well as many internal structural , systems and process changes . we have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand , ubiquitous compute , pervasive connectivity , cloud to edge infrastructure , ai , and sensing . in recent years , we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete gpus , mobility solutions , ai accelerators , ipu products , and silicon photonics . as part of our idm [X.X] strategy , we announced plans to establish ifs as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes , systems , and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product - based business units . the implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural , system , and process changes to support the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business , including a new erp system . in parallel , we are undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business , such as psg and ims , to raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities . significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful . for example , in [XXXX] , we wound down intel optane ; in [XXXX] , we agreed to sell our nand memory business to sk hynix ; and in [XXXX] , we exited the [X] g smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses . these new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity , and they also introduce new sources of competition , including , in some cases , incumbent competitors with established technologies , ecosystems , and customer bases , lower prices , margins , or costs , and greater brand recognition . these developing products and market segments require significant investment , do not always grow as projected or at all , or sometimes adopt competing technologies , and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments . for example , ai and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology , but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads , or if our customers use competing technologies , we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas . similarly , we expect intense competition related to the significant opportunity we see in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge and may not succeed in our efforts . to be successful , we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings . despite our ongoing efforts , there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments , which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges , as well as opportunity costs . our smart capital approach to capital spending , alternative financing arrangements and pursuit of government grants involves risks and may not be successful . as we pursue our idm [X.X] strategy , we have utilized our smart capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and scale our capital investments . to support our capital investments , we have pursued alternative financing arrangements , such as our [XXXX] joint investment with brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our arizona campus , and expect to enter into similar arrangements in the future . these transactions may fail to advance our business strategy , may include unfavorable pricing or other terms , and may fail to achieve their anticipated benefits . our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to resolve any potential disputes . any of these risks , including our ability to effectuate any additional transactions at all , could have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition , or cash flows , which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital for our required investments . in addition , as part of our smart capital approach , we have applied for , received , and expect to receive additional grants and incentives from domestic and foreign local , regional and national governments . legislation in the us and eu has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions , but there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to the conditions and restrictions that may apply to us as a recipient of such funding . for example , we expect to receive substantial grants from the us government under the chips act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in the us and the german government under the eu chips act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in germany . however , governments may choose not to award grants and incentives in sufficient amounts or in a timely manner to support our capital investment plans and to offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as compared to those of many of our competitors , or we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of such grants and incentives . to the extent such funding is below our expectations , we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements , or we are required to return any amounts received from any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations contained therein , our anticipated cash requirements would increase . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results . our products are used in different market segments , and demand for our products varies within or among them . it is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact . for example , we expect the pc tam to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base , demand for ai capabilities , new platforms , shorter replacement cycles , and adoption in new markets ; however , the pc industry has been highly cyclical in the past , and these growth expectations may not materialize , or we may fail to capitalize on them . changes in the demand for our products , particularly our ccg , dcai , and nex platform products , have in the past and may in the future reduce our revenue , lower our gross margin , or require us to write down the value of our assets . important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include : ▪ business conditions , including downturns in the market segments in which we operate , or in global or regional economies ; ▪ consumer confidence , income levels , and customer capital spending , which can be impacted by changes in market conditions , including changes in government borrowing or spending , taxation , interest rates , the credit market , current or expected inflation , employment , and energy or other commodity prices ; ▪ geopolitical conditions , including trade policies and geopolitical tensions and conflicts ; ▪ our ability to timely introduce competitive products ; ▪ competitive and pricing pressures , including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors ; ▪ the level of our customers ' inventories and computing capacity ; ▪ customer order patterns and order cancellations , including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products , customers ' products , and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles ; and disruptions affecting customers , such as the delays in obtaining tools , components , and other supplies as a result of covid-19 - related port shutdowns in china that negatively impacted demand for our business in [XXXX] , as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in [XXXX] ; ▪ market acceptance and industry support of our products and services , including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our products , such as software to harness the new ai capabilities of our latest cpus , as well as our foundry services offerings through ifs ; and ▪ customer product needs and emerging technology trends , including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end - user computing workloads , such as work- and learn - from - home trends . our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs . for example , our core product offerings range from lower - priced and entry - level platforms , such as those based on intel atom processors , to higher - end platforms based on intel xeon processors . our ancillary product offerings that extend beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher - priced products , and at times are not profitable . to the extent demand shifts from our higher - priced to lower - priced core products in any of our market segments , or our ancillary products represent a greater share of our mix of products sold , our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again . macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts , including changes to trade policies and regulations , present significant risks to us in many jurisdictions . we have manufacturing , assembly and test , r&d , sales , and other operations in many countries , and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas . our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed , and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more geographic areas . moreover , sales outside the us accounted for [XX] % of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december [XX] , [XXXX] , with revenue from billings to china contributing [XX] % of our total revenue . as a result , our operations and our financial results , including our ability to execute our business strategy , manufacture , assemble and test , design , develop , or sell products , and the demand for our products , are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control . adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur , including recession or slowing growth ; changes or uncertainty in fiscal , monetary , or trade policy ; higher interest rates ; tighter credit ; inflation ; lower capital expenditures by businesses , including on it infrastructure ; increases in unemployment ; and lower consumer confidence and spending . adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions , including regarding prioritization of investments in our business . an economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks , higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets , reduced liquidity , adverse impacts on our suppliers , failures of counterparties , including financial institutions and insurers , asset impairments , and declines in the value of our financial instruments . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs , trade barriers , and other protectionist measures , which can increase our manufacturing costs , make our products less competitive , reduce demand for our products , limit our ability to sell to certain customers , limit our ability to procure components or raw materials , or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders . increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations , domestic sourcing initiatives , or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in , or restrict our access to , some markets . they can also result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession , and could cause our customers to reduce , cancel , or alter the timing of their purchases with us . sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long - term changes in global trade and technology supply chains , domestic sourcing initiatives , and decoupling of global trade networks , which could make it more difficult to sell our products in , or restrict our access to , some markets and have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects . in particular , geopolitical and trade tensions between the us and china , one of our largest markets , have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions , including tariffs applicable to some of our products , and have affected customer ordering patterns . further , the us has imposed restrictions on the export of us - regulated products and technology to certain chinese technology companies , including certain of our customers . specifically , in [XXXX] the us significantly increased us export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and on artificial intelligence and advanced computing products . in [XXXX] , the us added to the restrictions in all three areas and also worked with japan and the netherlands to align on additional restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment . during this time , the us has increasingly added chinese companies to prohibited lists . in response , china has restricted us access to certain minerals and has blocked certain companies that provide products to taiwan 's military from selling products in china . these restrictions have in some instances reduced our sales and in a number of instances required specific governmental authorizations or exceptions - $ [X.X] billion , or [X] % , of our [XXXX] revenue was dependent upon us government export control authorizations , an amount that we expect may increase in future years . these and potential future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance and result in reputational harm to us . in addition , a number of semiconductor companies in china , including semiconductor manufacturing international corporation ( smic ) , are making significant investments , in many instances with the support of the chinese government , in advanced semiconductor technologies to enable such companies to develop products and technologies that compete with ours . it is difficult to predict what further trade - related actions governments may take , the extent to which we may be able to mitigate the effects of any such actions , and the longer - term implications of such actions on the market opportunities for us and the competition we may face . we can also be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur , including : ▪ geopolitical and security issues , such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest , political instability , human rights concerns , and terrorist activity , including , for example : ▪ russia ’s war with ukraine , initiated in [XXXX] , which resulted : in the imposition of financial and other sanctions and export controls against russia and belarus that caused us and other companies to limit or suspend russian operations ( we had no exports to russia in [XXXX] ) ; russia - imposed currency restrictions and regulations and other retaliatory trade and other actions ; increased supply , commodity , and other costs ; and increased risk of cyberattacks ; ▪ tensions and conflict affecting israel , where we have multiple semiconductor development centers and a leading - edge manufacturing facility and where our mobileye business is headquartered and has most of its operations , and in surrounding areas , such as past conflicts in lebanon and the current conflict in the red sea ; and ▪ rising tensions between china and taiwan ; ▪ natural disasters , public health issues ( including pandemics ) , and other catastrophic events ; ▪ inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions , such as supply chain interruptions , materials shortages or delays , and large - scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities , transportation , data hosting , or telecommunications providers ; ▪ formal or informal imposition of new or revised export , import , or doing - business regulations , including trade sanctions , tariffs , and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses , which could be changed without notice ; ▪ government restrictions on , or nationalization of , our operations in any country , or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from or distribute compensation or other funds in a particular country ; ▪ adverse changes relating to government grants , tax credits , or other government incentives , including more favorable incentives provided to competitors ; ▪ differing employment practices and labor issues , including restricted access to talent ; ▪ ineffective legal protection of our ip rights in certain countries ; ▪ local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices ; ▪ continuing uncertainty regarding social , political , immigration , and tax and trade policies in the us and abroad ; and ▪ fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments , and in the capital and credit markets , which can be negatively affected by liquidity , credit deterioration or losses , interest rate changes , financial results , political risk , sovereign risk , or other factors . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we are subject to numerous risks associated with the evolving market for products with ai capabilities . the markets and use cases for products with ai capabilities have been rapidly evolving , are difficult to predict and may impact demand for our products . for example , in the last few years the demand for high - end gpus for model training increased dramatically and has resulted and may continue to result in a significant shift in dcai customer spend . the significant investments we have made to develop products and software to address what we believe will be increasing demand for ai capabilities may be insufficient , and we face significant hurdles , including whether demand will materialize , whether third - party developers will develop the software to utilize the ai capabilities of our products , and whether we will be successful in developing products that can compete with offerings by established competitors . our use of ai technology may subject us to reputational , financial , legal , or regulatory risks . as we incorporate ai technology into our products and services , any failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of the evolving ai technology in our products and services may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability and , as such , may increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and issues . ai technology may create ethical issues , generate defective algorithms , and present other risks that create challenges with respect to its adoption . in addition , evolving rules , regulations , and industry standards governing ai may require us to expend significant resources to modify , maintain , or align our business practices or products to comply with us and non - us rules and regulations , the nature of which can not be determined at this time . several jurisdictions around the globe , including the eu and certain us states , have already proposed or enacted laws governing ai . us federal agencies are likely to release ai regulations in the near future in light of the biden administration ’s october [XX] , [XXXX] executive order on ai . the regulatory environment surrounding the impact of the implementation of ai on our products and services may adversely affect our ability to produce and export products and as a result may cause harm to our reputation and financial liability . we rely upon a complex global supply chain . we have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers . these suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes ; supply tools , equipment , and ip ( via licenses ) for our factories ; deliver logistics and packaging services ; and supply software , lab and office equipment , and other goods and services used in our business . we also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products . from time to time , we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues , including : ▪ suppliers extending lead times , experiencing capacity constraints , limiting or canceling supply , allocating supply to other customers including competitors , delaying or canceling deliveries , or increasing prices ; ▪ supplier quality issues ; ▪ cybersecurity events , ip or other litigation , man - made or natural disasters , public health issues ( including pandemics ) , operational failures , or other events that disrupt suppliers ; ▪ long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers , or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers ; and ▪ increased legislation , regulation , or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices , such as heightened reporting and other obligations with regard to environmental impacts , the risk of forced labor , or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards , which can result in supply chain disruptions , the loss of a supplier , and the government seizure of goods . these and other supply chain issues can increase our costs , disrupt or reduce our production , delay our product shipments , prevent us from meeting customer demand , damage our customer relationships , or negatively affect our reputation . they may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business , competitive position , results of operation , and financial condition . from time to time , our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products . during the past several years , macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions , as well as outbreaks of covid-19 , caused supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining tools and other components , and the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity . these shortages have previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses , and have adversely affected customer demand for our products , as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third - party components used together with our products to produce finished systems . it is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur . to obtain future supply of certain materials and components , particularly substrates , and third - party foundry manufacturing capacity , we have entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long - term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments . these arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements , or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all , or their financial condition may deteriorate . if future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements falls below our expectations , we could have excess or obsolete inventory , unneeded capacity , and increased costs , and our prepayments may not be fully utilized , and in some cases may not be fully recoverable . we utilize third - party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking , communications , graphics , programmable semiconductor solutions , and memory . as part of our idm [X.X] strategy , we expect to increase our use of third - party foundries . delays in the development of foundries ’ future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes , and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand . we typically have less control over delivery schedules , design and manufacturing co - optimization , yields , quality , product quantities , and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end where possible , we seek to have several sources of supply . however , for certain components , services , materials , and equipment , we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers , or upon suppliers in a single location , which can impact the nature , quality , availability , and pricing of the products and services available to us . for example , asml holding n.v . ( asml ) is currently the sole supplier of euv photolithography tools that we are deploying in our intel [X] and subsequent manufacturing process nodes . these tools are highly complex to develop and produce , and increasingly costly , and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability , which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes . as a further example , a limited number of third - party foundries offer leading - edge manufacturing processes , and these providers are geographically concentrated in asia . supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers . we are subject to the risks of product defects , errata , or other product issues . from time to time , we identify product defects , errata , and other product issues , which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes . components and products we purchase or license from third - party suppliers , or gain through acquisitions , can also contain defects . product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third - party products and software . we face risks if products that we design , manufacture , or sell , or that include our technology , cause personal injury or property damage , even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata . these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices , market segments , technologies , or applications , including transportation , autonomous driving , healthcare , communications , financial services , and other industrial , critical infrastructure , and consumer uses . costs from defects , errata , or other product issues could include : ▪ writing off some or all of the value of inventory ; ▪ recalling products that have been shipped ; ▪ providing product replacements or modifications ; ▪ providing consideration to customers , including reimbursement for certain costs they incur ; ▪ defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages ; ▪ paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies ; and ▪ reputational harm . these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin , and/or result in delay or loss of revenue . mitigation techniques designed to address product issues , including software and firmware updates , are not always available on a timely basis — or at all — and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications . we and third parties , such as hardware and software vendors , make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address , which can delay , limit , or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs . product defects , errata , or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures , adverse performance and power effects , reboots , system instability or unavailability , loss of functionality , data loss or corruption , unpredictable system behavior , decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features , and other issues . product issues can damage our reputation , negatively affect product demand , delay product releases or deployment , result in legal liability , or make our products less competitive , which could harm our business and financial results . subsequent events or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of a product issue . in addition , our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred . our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim , and losses not covered by insurance could be large , which could harm our financial condition . we face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products . we or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products , as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them . components and ip we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products , as well as industry - standard specifications we implement in our products , are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities . our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks , including applications that gather and process large amounts of data , such as the cloud or internet of things , and critical infrastructure and automotive applications . the security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side - channel vulnerabilities , such as the variants referred to as "" spectre "" and "" meltdown . "" additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified . publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in , and is expected to continue to result in , increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities . security and manageability features in our products can not make our products absolutely secure , and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities . vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known . we , our customers , and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability , including the extent , if any , to which a vulnerability has been exploited . subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability , including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates , become aware of additional variants , evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products , and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations , as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities in our products , including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures , are not always available on a timely basis — or at all — and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications . in addition , we are often required to rely on third parties , including hardware , software , and services vendors , as well as our customers and end users , to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques , and the availability , effectiveness , and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether , when , and how to develop and deploy mitigations . export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists , potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation . further , sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure , which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them . we and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address , which can delay , limit , or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation . security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects , reboots , system instability or unavailability , loss of functionality , data loss or corruption , unpredictable system behavior , decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features , and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties . security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations , financial condition , customer relationships , prospects , and reputation in a number of ways , any of which may be material . for example , whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits , they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations , writing down inventory value , defending against product claims and litigation , responding to regulatory inquiries or actions , paying damages , addressing customer satisfaction considerations , providing product replacements or modifications , or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties . adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services . these effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products . moreover , third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available , which , in turn , could lead to attempted or successful exploits , adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations , or otherwise harm our business and reputation . we are subject to increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks . we face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to : the breadth of geographies , networks , and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks ; the complexity , technical sophistication , value , and widespread use of our systems , products and processes ; the attractiveness of our systems , products and processes to threat actors ( including state - sponsored organizations ) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers ; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material cybersecurity incident ; and our use of third - party products , services and components . such an incident , whether or not successful , could result in our incurring significant costs related to , for example , rebuilding our internal systems , writing down inventory value , implementing additional threat protection measures , providing modifications to our products and services , defending against litigation or enforcement proceedings , paying damages , providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us , or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties , as well as incurring significant reputational harm . we regularly face attempts by malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers , customers , partners , end users , or other third parties ; steal proprietary , personal , or confidential information related to our business , products , employees , suppliers , or customers ; introduce malicious software to our systems or those of our suppliers , customers , partners , end users , or other third parties ; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers , customers , or others ; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services . as we grow certain emerging business lines , such as our foundry business and our cloud computing and software - as - a - service offerings , we expect to collect or host significant amounts of highly sensitive customer data , which may increasingly make us a target of attempts to steal or corrupt that data . individuals and organizations , including malicious hackers , state - sponsored organizations , insider threats including employees and third - party service providers , and intruders into our physical facilities , at times attempt to gain unauthorized access to and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services . we are also a frequent target of attackers that intend to sabotage , compromise , take control of , or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes , products , and services . in some instances , we , our suppliers , our customers , and the users of our products and services may be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects , or we may be unable to timely mitigate the impacts of an incident . cyber attack attempts are increasing in number , magnitude , and technical sophistication , and if successful may expose us and the affected parties to loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions to our business operations , including our manufacturing operations , and could impact our financial results . we expect emerging technologies to contribute to the increasing sophistication of attacks and to lead to new threats . for example , threat actors may leverage emerging ai technologies to develop new hacking tools and attack vectors , exploit vulnerabilities , obscure their activities , and increase the difficulty of threat attribution . as a developer of leading - node processes and widely utilized products , we have been , and expect to continue to be , the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries , including state - sponsored organizations , who seek to compromise our systems , disrupt our operations or those of users of our products , or steal trade secrets . as geopolitical or armed global conflicts escalate , attacks against us , our customers , or our strategic allies may similarly intensify . for example , from [XXXX] to [XXXX] , we , along with other companies with meaningful operations in israel , were targets of concerted cyberattacks . in the fourth quarter of [XXXX] , our habana labs subsidiary ’s network was breached in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack , resulting in unauthorized third - party access of certain confidential information . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we are also subject to risks associated with attacks on products , services and components in our supply chain , such as the [XXXX] compromise of it infrastructure management software provided by solarwinds corporation . these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products , or provide inadequate updates or support , which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information . since [XXXX] , we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain . in december [XXXX] , a vulnerability named “ log4shell ” was reported for the widely used java logging library , apache log4j * [X] , and similar vulnerabilities affecting commonly used programs and tools were reported in [XXXX] and [XXXX] . we are required to comply with stringent , complex , and evolving laws , rules , regulations , and standards in many jurisdictions , as well as contractual obligations , relating to cybersecurity and data privacy . our compliance efforts are complicated by the fact that these requirements and obligations may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement , and may conflict among various jurisdictions . any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws , rules , regulations , standards , certifications , or contractual obligations , or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to , or unauthorized loss , destruction , use , modification , acquisition , disclosure , release , or transfer of personal information , may result in outcomes such as : requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices ; the expenditure of substantial costs , time , and other resources ; proceedings or actions against us ; legal liability ; governmental investigations ; enforcement actions ; claims ; fines ; judgments ; awards ; penalties ; sanctions ; and potentially costly litigation ( including class actions ) . the theft , loss , or misuse of personal data collected , used , stored , or transferred by us to run our business , including data stored with vendors or other third parties , could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims . costs to comply with and implement privacy - related and data - protection measures are significant , and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties , damage to our reputation , suspension of online services or sites in certain countries , and even criminal sanctions . even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal , state , or international privacy - related or data - protection laws and regulations could result in audits , regulatory inquiries , or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties . we are subject to ip risks , including related litigation and regulatory proceedings . we can not always protect our ip or enforce our ip rights . we regard our patents , copyrights , trade secrets , and other ip rights as important to the success of our business . we rely on ip law — as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers , employees , technology development partners , and others — to protect our ip and ip rights . our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks , as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries and other geopolitical factors . we are not always able to obtain protection for our ip or enforce or protect our ip rights . when we seek to enforce our rights , we may be subject to claims that our ip rights are invalid , not enforceable , or licensed to an opposing party . our assertion of ip rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us , which could harm our business . from time to time , governments adopt regulations — and governments or courts render decisions — requiring compulsory licensing of ip rights , or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies . our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business . in some cases , our ip rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations . in addition , the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products ; as a result , the value of our investment in r&d , product development , and marketing could be reduced . this risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees . our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights . technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements . some of our competitors have in the past had , and may in the future have , licenses to some of our patents , and under current case law , some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances . our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry - standard specifications . depending on the rules of the organization , government regulations , or court decisions , we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost , and as a result , we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others , and the value of our ip rights may be impaired . third parties assert claims based on ip rights against us and our products , which could harm our business . we face claims based on ip rights from individuals , companies , investment litigation entities , other non - practicing entities , academic and research institutions , and other parties . we have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well - funded non - practicing entities , including entities funded by third - party investment firms . these lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business , impact our reputation or relationship with customers , and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products . the patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non - competitors . as a result , we believe we are facing a more hostile ip litigation environment than in past years . we are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving ip rights . claims that our products , technologies , or processes infringe the ip rights of others , regardless of their merits , cause us to incur large costs to respond to , defend , and resolve the claims , and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations . in addition , we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third - party trade secrets , confidential information , or end - user data that we obtain in conducting our business . any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business , and we could suffer losses , including the cost of product recalls and returns , and reputational harm . furthermore , in many instances we agree to indemnify customers for certain ip rights claims against them . ip rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers ' businesses , which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end as a result of ip rights claims , we could : ▪ pay monetary damages , payments to satisfy indemnification obligations , royalties , fines , or penalties ; ▪ stop manufacturing , using , selling , offering to sell , or importing products or technology subject to claims ; ▪ need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims , which could be time - consuming or costly ; and/or ▪ enter into settlement or license agreements , which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly . these ip rights claims could harm our competitive position , result in expenses , or require us to impair our assets . if we alter or stop production of affected items , our revenue could be harmed . we rely on access to third - party ip , which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms , if at all . many of our products are designed to include third - party technology or implement industry standards , which may require licenses from third parties . in addition , from time to time , third parties notify us that they believe we are using their ip . there is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our existing licenses to such third - party ip can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all . failure to obtain the right to use third - party technology , or to license ip on commercially reasonable terms , could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results . to the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open - source software , we may be required to make the software 's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open - source licensing terms . we are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters . from time to time , we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder , consumer , competition , commercial , ip , labor and employment , compliance , and other issues . as described in "" note [XX] : commitments and contingencies "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements , we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters . litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain , and adverse rulings , excessive verdicts , or other events could occur , including monetary damages , fines , penalties , or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products , engaging in certain business practices , or requiring other remedies , such as compulsory licensing of patents . an unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . regardless of the outcome , litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly , time - consuming , disruptive to our operations , harmful to our reputation , and distracting to management . we must attract , retain , and motivate key talent . we believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives , scientists , engineers , technical talent , sales representatives , and other professionals are critical to our business . the competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense , with the demand often exceeding supply . competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees , and the availability of flexible , hybrid , or work - from - home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition . in addition , changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent . from time to time , we have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent , such as during [XXXX] and 1h [XXXX] , and these efforts have increased our expenses . further , we may not be successful in attracting , retaining , and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy , and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring and reduce our workforce to respond to business conditions that differ from our expectations , which can be disruptive , compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goals , and impact our ability to recruit in the future . changes in employment - related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs . to help attract , retain , and motivate qualified employees , we use share - based awards , such as rsus , and performance - based cash incentive awards . sustained declines in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to our competitors have been reducing the retention value of our share - based awards , which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation . our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice . to the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive , or changes in our workforce and related restructuring , reduction - in - force or other initiatives are not viewed favorably , our ability to attract , retain , and motivate employees can be weakened , which could harm our results of operations . in addition , significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and culture , as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures , including due to the loss of historical , technical , and other expertise . changes in our management team and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations . to the extent we do not effectively hire , onboard , retain , and motivate key employees , our business can be harmed . we are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions and investments . we routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions , divestitures , and other strategic transactions , which are an important component of our financial allocation strategy . these transactions involve numerous risks , including : ▪ our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us ; ▪ failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize ; ▪ disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management 's attention ; ▪ failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely ; ▪ our inability to exercise sole decision - making authority regarding a project , property , or entity ; ▪ failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner , or at all , due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals on a timely basis or without materially burdensome conditions or mandated acquisitions , divestitures , or disposals , ip disputes or other litigation , difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us , or other unforeseen factors ; # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end ▪ our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment , potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets , and restructuring charges ; ▪ our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses ; ▪ our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority - owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating or separating employees , business systems , and technology or otherwise operating the acquired or majority - owned business ; ▪ controls , processes , and procedures of acquired or majority - owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations and create complexity and inconsistency in application of controls , processes and procedures , and our failure to identify and/or address compliance issues , including accounting errors , or liabilities ; ▪ our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners , including as a result of differences in our interests or goals ; ▪ our failure to identify , or our underestimation of , commitments , liabilities , accounting and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets , majority - owned businesses or novel transactions ; and ▪ the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt . any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition , or cash flows , particularly in the case of a large acquisition , divestiture or partial divestiture , or several concurrent strategic transactions . moreover , our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs ; accordingly , if we pursue a particular transaction , we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives . where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities , we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options . we may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms ; changes in market , macroeconomic , or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate ; changes in applicable laws ; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals ; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approvals , litigation , contractual terms , or other conditions ; delays in closing ; lack of support by third parties ; actions by competitors ; adverse effects on our business relationships , operating results , or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transactions ; and continued financial obligations , unanticipated liabilities , or transition costs associated with such transactions . in some cases , we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all . in addition , we make investments in public and private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives . these companies can include early - stage companies still defining their strategic direction . many of the instruments in which we invest are non - marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment , and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion , if at all . our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company , if any , is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event , such as a public offering or acquisition . to the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful , which at times includes bankruptcy , we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment . we are subject to sales - related risks . we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties . we sell a significant portion of our products through third parties , such as distributors , value - added resellers , and channel partners ( collectively referred to as distributors ) , as well as oems and odms . we depend on many distributors to help us create end - customer demand , provide technical support and other value - added services to customers , fill customer orders , and stock our products . at times , we rely on one or more key distributors for a product , and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue . our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited . in addition , our distributors ' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor ; as a result , end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor . using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks , including competitive pressure and concentration , credit , and compliance risks . distributors and other third parties often sell products that compete with our products , and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products . from time to time , they may face financial difficulties , including bankruptcy , which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results . further , any violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by distributors or other third - party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business , including subjecting us to litigation or regulatory risk . failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales , increase expenses , and weaken our competitive position . from time to time , our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized "" gray market . "" our policies and procedures designed to keep our products away from the gray market may not be successful in achieving this objective . gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies , which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities . gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging . gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged , and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard . we receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers . collectively , our three largest customers accounted for [XX] % of our net revenue in [XXXX] , [XX] % of our net revenue in [XXXX] and [XX] % of our net revenue in [XXXX] . we expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end industry trends , such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud , have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers , particularly hyperscalers , in some of our data center - focused businesses . the cloud and cloud applications represent an increasingly demanding computing environment . the further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud , and consolidation among cloud service providers , can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments ; optimization for cloud services and applications ; product performance ; energy efficiency ; feature differentiation ; product quality , reliability , and factors affecting server uptime ; and product security and security features . our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors . we are operating in an increasingly competitive environment , including serving cloud service provider customers , and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in dcai in [XXXX] and [XXXX] . some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed , and may continue to develop , their own semiconductors , including designs customized for their specific computing workloads . in addition , cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications , or they can abstract hardware under layers of software , which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users . the shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected , and may continue to affect , sales to enterprise customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads from their own internal data center infrastructures to cloud service providers . to the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications , order changes , delays , or cancellations may result in non - recoverable costs . the loss of key customers , a substantial reduction in sales to them , or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue , increase the volatility of our results , and harm our results of operations and financial condition . for information about our customers who accounted for greater than [XX] % of our net consolidated revenue , see "" note [X] : operating segments "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements . we face risks related to transactions with government entities . we receive proceeds from both us and non - us governments associated with grants , incentives , and sales of our products and services , and we are seeking to increase our sales of products and services to governmental entities in the future . government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations , including , with respect to us government contracts , congressional approval of appropriations , and can be adversely impacted by shutdowns of the us federal government . government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award , administration , and performance of those contracts , as well as oversight and penalties for violations . for example , certain agreements with the us government are subject to special rules on accounting , ip rights , expenses , reviews , information handling , security , customers , and/or employees , and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions , including termination of contracts , fines , and suspension or debarment from future business with the us government . we face risks related to our debt obligations . as we pursue our idm [X.X] strategy , we have incurred significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial condition , including our ability to fully implement our strategy . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had $ [XX.X] billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and other borrowings outstanding . in addition , we have a commercial paper program of up to $ [XX.X] billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to $ [XX.X] billion . as we continue to pursue our idm [X.X] strategy , we expect to incur additional indebtedness , refinance our existing debt , and issue additional notes or other debt securities in the future at a variety of interest rates , maturities , and terms . the semiconductor industry is a cyclical business and our revenue , cash flows , and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle , as well as prevailing macroeconomic conditions , our business strategy , and other risks described in these risk factors . these fluctuations , together with our debt level and related debt service obligations , could have the effect of , among other things , reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings that can potentially impact the value of our outstanding debt and increase our borrowing costs . we may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital , capital expenditures , debt service obligations , debt refinancing , future acquisitions , or other general corporate purposes , which will depend on , among other factors , our financial position and performance , as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control . consequently , we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us , or at all , which could adversely impact our ability to finance our business strategy and service and repay outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due , all of which could adversely impact our business , financial condition , and the cost of borrowing . we have significantly reduced our return of capital to stockholders in recent years . in recent years , we have not made repurchases of our stock and reduced the amount of our quarterly dividend . there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current level , or at all . in addition , we are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program and there can be no assurances as to the amount , timing , and execution of any future share repurchases , or that any repurchases will enhance long - term stockholder value . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business . we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions and affect our operations in areas including , but not limited to : ip ownership and infringement ; tax ; import and export requirements ; anti - corruption ; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions ; data privacy and localization requirements ; competition ; advertising ; employment and labor ; product regulations ; environment , health , and safety requirements ; and consumer laws . compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively . for example , unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to [X] g or autonomous driving technology and maas may limit global adoption , impede our strategy , or negatively impact our long - term expectations for our investments in these areas . expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy - related and data - protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services , particularly in cloud , internet of things , and ai applications , which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads . our policies , controls , and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws can not provide assurance that our employees , contractors , suppliers , or agents will not violate such laws or our policies . violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines ; criminal sanctions against us , our officers , or our employees ; prohibitions on the conduct of our business ; and damage to our reputation . the technology industry is subject to intense media , political , and regulatory scrutiny , which can increase our exposure to government investigations , legal actions , and penalties . we are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . we are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates . although most of our sales occur in us dollars , expenses may be paid in local currencies . an increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars , and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll , utilities , tax , and marketing expenses , as well as non - us dollar capital expenditures . we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies . our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any , or more than a portion , of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements ; therefore , changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition . changes in our effective tax rate may impact our net income . a number of factors can impact our future effective tax rate or cash payments , which could cause significant variability in our financial results including : ▪ changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates ; ▪ changes in our business or legal entity operating model ; ▪ the resolution of issues arising from tax audits , including payment of interest and penalties ; ▪ changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities , and in deferred tax valuation allowances ; ▪ adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of tax returns ; ▪ increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes , including impairments of goodwill ; ▪ changes in available tax credits , including non - us tax credits , r&d credits and refundable tax credits ; ▪ expirations or changes in our ability to secure new tax holidays and incentives ; ▪ changes in us federal , state , or foreign tax laws or their interpretation , including the global implementation of a minimum tax under pillar two of the oecd beps initiative ; ▪ changes in us gaap ; and ▪ our decision to repatriate non - us earnings for which we have not previously provided for incremental taxes including any local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation . catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results . our operations and business , and those of our customers and suppliers , can be disrupted by natural disasters ; industrial accidents ; public health issues and global pandemics such as covid [XX] ; cybersecurity incidents ; interruptions of service from utilities , transportation restrictions or disruptions , telecommunications , or it systems providers ; manufacturing equipment failures ; geopolitical conflict ; terrorism ; or other catastrophic events . for example , we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages , improperly functioning equipment , and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components , including cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers . our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters . global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity , such as drought , wildfires , storms , sea - level rise , and flooding , and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities , including our facilities located in water - sensitive regions such as arizona and israel . in addition , to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources , our reputation could be harmed . in recent years , the west coast of the us has experienced significant wildfires , including in oregon , where we have major manufacturing facilities , and in california , where we are headquartered . the long - term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end catastrophic events including global pandemics could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers , receive production materials from our suppliers , or perform critical functions , which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations . the covid-19 pandemic previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted historical patterns related to demand for our products and services that may impact our ability to accurately predict future demand , trends , or other matters that may impact our financial performance . while we maintain business recovery plans , some of our systems are not fully redundant and we can not be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions . furthermore , even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly , if our customers or suppliers can not timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event , we may experience reduced or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations . we are subject to risks associated with environmental , health , safety , and product regulations . the design , manufacturing , assembly and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental , health , and safety laws and regulations . our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor ( e.g. , mining conflict minerals ) , and restrictions on other materials , as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities , sale and distribution of our products , and use of our real property . the scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations , including the materials they govern , are complex and continue to evolve . the procedures and processes in place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and can not guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to whom such laws apply . the amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations , as well as our failure or inability to comply with them ( including as a result of acquired entities ) can result in regulatory penalties , fines , and legal liabilities ; increased costs ; additional remediation obligations ; suspension of production ; alteration , suspension , or termination of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes , including due to an inability to find , afford , or attain adequate substitute materials , equipment , or processes ; damage to our reputation ; and restrictions on our operations or sales . in addition , the failure or inability to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes and sources , and result in increased risks and costs . the failure or inability by us or our customers and suppliers to manage the use , transportation , emissions , discharge , storage , recycling , or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities . environmental regulations , including with respect to the materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and wastewater requirements , may impede our ability to manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future . environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment , modify product designs , cease the use of a particular material or process , remove or remediate hazardous substances , or incur other expenses or liabilities . regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements . for example , semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons , which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions . new or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds , or other greenhouse gas emissions , could require us to install additional abatement equipment , purchase carbon offsets , and/or alter , where feasible , our production processes and sources . in addition , new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs , for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities . regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( pfas ) , which are found in parts , components , process chemicals and other materials used in semiconductor manufacturing . such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited technically and commercially feasible alternatives to them . as we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our idm [X.X] strategy , the impacts of future regulation could be magnified . many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are also subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations . these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes . our initiatives and new legal requirements with respect to corporate responsibility matters present various risks . our corporate responsibility initiatives , including our rise strategy and related goals , could expose us to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial , legal , reputational , operational , compliance , and other risks , including lost customer opportunities , which could negatively impact us . our achievement of initiatives , aspirations , and goals related to corporate responsibility matters , including those related to sustainability , is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions , risks , and expectations ; as well as standards , processes , and methodologies that continue to evolve . further , any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders ' evolving expectations could also negatively impact us . in addition , we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate - related and other sustainability laws and regulations , including , for example , the state of california 's new climate change disclosure requirements , the eu 's new corporate sustainability reporting directive and proposed climate - change disclosure requirements from the sec . compliance with such laws and regulations , as well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from the sec and other regulators , investors , customers , vendors , employees , and other stakeholders concerning esg and climate matters , could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks , including resulting in changes to our current esg goals . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end sales and marketing customers we sell our products primarily to oems , odms , and cloud service providers . odms provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private - label resellers . in addition , our customers include other manufacturers and service providers , such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor , reseller , retail , and oem channels throughout the world . for information on customers who accounted for greater than [XX] % of our net consolidated revenue , see "" note [X] : operating segments "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements . our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers — systems builders that purchase intel processors and other products from our distributors . certain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets . sales arrangements our products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world . sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing , payment terms , and warranties , as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products , such as patent and copyright indemnities . because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis , they can typically cancel , change , or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty . from time to time , we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering , for example , changes from our standard terms and conditions , new product development and marketing , and private - label branding . our sales are routinely made using electronic and web - based processes that allow customers to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered . pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors . we also offer discounts , rebates , and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology . in accordance with contract terms , the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location , as determined by the agreed - upon shipping terms . our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date , usually [XX] days after shipment or delivery . we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis . from this analysis , we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices , such as obtaining a parent guarantee , standby letter of credit , or credit insurance . credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy , fraud , or other failure of the customer to pay . our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise . under the price protection program , we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer . our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection , nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted . the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor . distribution distributors typically handle a wide variety of products , including those that compete with our products , and fill orders for many customers . customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors . we have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers . seasonal trends historically , our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year , accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter . in [XXXX] , continued strong covid - driven notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe . in [XXXX] , we had a flatter trend than we historically observe as we experienced the uncertainty and impacts , including demand volatility and supply chain disruption , of macroeconomic conditions , the potential for a recession , and the risk for continued covid - related disruptions or shutdowns . in [XXXX] , our net revenue seasonality was more consistent with our historical pre - pandemic trend . marketing our global marketing objectives are to build a strong , well - known , differentiated , and meaningful intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers , and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases . the intel core processor family and the intel atom , celeron ® , pentium ® , intel ® movidius ™ , and intel xeon trademarks make up our key cpu brands . this year we introduced our new intel ® core ™ ultra processors , powering the latest ai pcs , and our 5th gen intel xeon processors , built with ai acceleration in every core . we also continue to bring to market new software services including independent attestation security with intel ® trust authority , intel ® granulate ™ for workload compute optimization , and intel developer cloud to accelerate ai development . our foundry services business aims to offer leading - edge packaging and process technology , geographically balanced manufacturing capacity and a world - class ip portfolio . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing , as well as through co - marketing programs . our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television , as well as consumer and trade events , industry and consumer communications , and press relations . we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products . our key messaging focuses on increased performance , improved energy efficiency , and other capabilities such as connectivity . certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs . these cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing . certain customers are licensed to place intel ® logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies , and to use our brands in their marketing activities . the program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands , subject to customers meeting defined criteria . these marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television , as well as press relations . we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates , as well as equity and commodity prices . our risk management programs are designed to reduce , but may not eliminate , the impacts of these risks . all of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december [XX] , [XXXX] and december [XX] , [XXXX] . actual results may differ materially . currency exchange rates we are exposed to currency exchange risks of non - us - dollar - denominated investments in debt and equity instruments , and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts , such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps . gains or losses on these non - us - currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments . substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars . however , a portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies , primarily the israeli shekel , the malaysian ringgit , the european union euro , the japanese yen , and the chinese yuan . we have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non - us - dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non - us - dollar monetary assets and liabilities . we may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency - denominated future investments . we may utilize foreign currency contracts , such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs . we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of [XX] % in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term . such an adverse change , after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of december [XX] , [XXXX] and december [XX] , [XXXX] , would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $ [XX] million and less than $ [XX] million , respectively . interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed - rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt . the primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields , which generally track the sofr . we generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed - rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into sofr - based returns . we also entered into swaps to convert fixed - rate coupon payments into floating - rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness . gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments . a hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of [X] % , after taking into account investment hedges , would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our investment portfolio of less than $ [XXX] million as of december [XX] , [XXXX] and as of december [XX] , [XXXX] . taking into account fixed - rate debt that is swapped to floating - rate debt , a hypothetical increase in interest rates of [X] % would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $ [XXX] million from debt outstanding as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ( a hypothetical increase of [X] % would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $ [XXX] million from debt outstanding as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ) . equity prices we are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities , which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $ [X.X] billion ( $ [X.X] billion as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ) . the substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of december [XX] , [XXXX] was concentrated in securities traded on the chinese shanghai stock exchange science and technology innovation board . to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities , we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio . assuming a decline of [XX] % in market prices , the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by $ [XXX] million , based on the value as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ( a decrease in value of $ [XXX] million , based on the value as of december [XX] , [XXXX] using an assumed decline of [XX] % ) . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements . gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities . many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non - marketable equity investments , although we can not always quantify the impacts directly . financial markets are volatile , which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in , their ability to raise additional capital , and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as ipos , mergers , and private sales . these types of investments involve a great deal of risk , and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful ; consequently , we could lose all or part of our investment . our non - marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $ [X.X] billion as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ( $ [X.X] billion as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ) and include our investment in beijing unisoc technology ltd . of $ [X.X] billion ( $ [X.X] billion as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ) . commodity price risk although we operate facilities that consume commodities , we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree . we have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices . we may use commodity derivatives contracts , such as commodity swaps , in these hedging programs . in addition , we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities . cybersecurity we face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to : the breadth of geographies , networks , and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks ; the complexity , technical sophistication , value , and widespread use of our systems , products and processes ; the attractiveness of our systems , products and processes to threat actors ( including state - sponsored organizations ) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers ; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material cybersecurity incident ; and our use of third - party products , services and components . we are committed to maintaining robust governance and oversight of these risks and to implementing mechanisms , controls , technologies , and processes designed to help us assess , identify , and manage these risks . while we have not , as of the date of this form [XX] - k , experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations , there can be no guarantee that we will not experience such an incident in the future . such incidents , whether or not successful , could result in our incurring significant costs related to , for example , rebuilding our internal systems , writing down inventory value , implementing additional threat protection measures , providing modifications or replacements to our products and services , defending against litigation , responding to regulatory inquiries or actions , paying damages , providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us , or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties , as well as incurring significant reputational harm . in addition , these threats are constantly evolving , thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures . we have seen an increase in cyberattack volume , frequency , and sophistication . we seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network , products , and services , and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services ; however , we remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats . in some instances , we , our suppliers , our customers , and the users of our products and services can be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects . further , there is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents , including reporting to regulators , which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm . see "" risk factors "" for more information on our cybersecurity risks and product vulnerability risks . we aim to incorporate industry best practices throughout our cybersecurity program . our cybersecurity strategy focuses on implementing effective and efficient controls , technologies , and other processes to assess , identify , and manage material cybersecurity risks . our cybersecurity program is designed to be aligned with applicable industry standards and is assessed annually by independent third - party auditors . we have processes in place to assess , identify , manage , and address material cybersecurity threats and incidents . these include , among other things : annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees ; mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual network activity ; and containment and incident response tools . we actively engage with industry groups for benchmarking and awareness of best practices . we monitor issues that are internally discovered or externally reported that may affect our products , and have processes to assess those issues for potential cybersecurity impact or risk . we also have a process in place to manage cybersecurity risks associated with third - party service providers . we impose security requirements upon our suppliers , including : maintaining an effective security management program ; abiding by information handling and asset management requirements ; and notifying us in the event of any known or suspected cyber incident . our board of directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk , which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program . that program is utilized in making decisions with respect to company priorities , resource allocations , and oversight structures . the board of directors is assisted by the audit & finance committee , which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program with management and reports to the board of directors . cybersecurity reviews by the audit & finance committee or the board of directors generally occur at least twice annually , or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable . a number of intel directors have experience in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end our cybersecurity program is run by our chief information security officer ( ciso ) , who reports to our executive vice president and chief technology officer ( cto ) . our ciso is informed about and monitors prevention , detection , mitigation , and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team , many of whom hold cybersecurity certifications such as a certified information systems security professional or certified information security manager , and through the use of technological tools and software and results from third party audits . our ciso and cto have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk . our ciso has served in that position since [XXXX] and , before intel , was previously the chief security officer at mcafee and the chief information officer and ciso for the us house of representatives . our cto joined intel in [XXXX] and was previously senior vice president and cto at vmware , with responsibility

status of any bank subsidiary . in certain instances , the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary . heightened supervisory standards . in the u.s . , the occ has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks , including minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk

insured depositary institution ( “ idi ” ) for administrative expense and the claims of holders of u.s . deposit liabilities ( including the fdic and deposits in non - u.s . branches that are dually

fee at the institution ’s cost to provide the product or at a benchmark determined by the cfpb . in october [XXXX] , the federal reserve board proposed to lower the maximum interchange fee that large

unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies on jpmorgan chase ’s workforce . • legal risks , including those relating to litigation and regulatory and government investigations . the above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below . regulatory jpmorgan chase ’s businesses are highly regulated , and the laws , rules and regulations that apply to jpmorgan chase have a significant impact on its business and operations . jpmorgan chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide . jpmorgan chase must comply with the laws , rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business , and financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase are subject to extensive and constantly - evolving regulation and supervision . the regulation and supervision of jpmorgan chase significantly affects the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations , and jpmorgan chase could be required to make changes to its business and operations in response to supervisory expectations or decisions or to new or changed laws , rules and regulations . these types of developments could result in jpmorgan chase incurring additional costs or experiencing a reduction in revenues to comply with applicable laws , rules and regulations , which could reduce its profitability . furthermore , jpmorgan chase ’s entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require jpmorgan chase to comply with additional laws , rules , and regulations . in response to new and existing laws , rules and regulations and expanded supervision , jpmorgan chase has in the past been and could in the future be , required to : • limit the products and services that it offers • reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market - making activities • refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue • pay higher taxes ( including as part of any minimum global tax regime ) , assessments , levies or other governmental charges , including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations • incur losses , including with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers • dispose of certain assets , and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous • impose restrictions on certain business activities , or • increase the prices that it charges for products and services , which could reduce the demand for them . any failure by jpmorgan chase to comply with the laws , rules and regulations to which it is subject could result in : • increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny • regulatory and governmental enforcement actions • the imposition of fines , penalties or other sanctions • increased exposure to litigation , or • harm to its reputation . differences and inconsistencies in financial services regulation and supervision can negatively impact jpmorgan chase ’s businesses , operations and financial results . the content and application of laws , rules and regulations affecting financial services firms can vary according to factors such as the size of the firm , the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates , and other criteria . for example : • larger firms such as jpmorgan chase are often subject to more stringent supervision , regulation and regulatory scrutiny • financial technology companies and other non - traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation , or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms , or • the financial services regulatory and supervisory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction . these types of differences in the regulatory and supervisory framework can result in jpmorgan chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation , especially with respect to unregulated financial products . # # table_start # # table_end there can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the u.s . and in other countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business . for example , when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory or supervisory standard , a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements , which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms , such as jpmorgan chase , that may be subject to those enhanced regulations . in addition , certain national and multi - national bodies and governmental agencies outside the u.s . have adopted laws , rules or regulations that may conflict with or prohibit jpmorgan chase from complying with laws , rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject , creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risk of non - compliance in those jurisdictions . legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the u.s . could require jpmorgan chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements . these include laws , rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed , as well as regulatory expectations , relating to : • the establishment of locally - based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries • requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally - based subsidiaries • the implementation of processes within locally - based subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory requirements or expectations • the separation ( or “ ring fencing ” ) of core banking products and services from markets activities • requirements for the orderly resolution of financial institutions • requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties ( “ ccps ” ) , or for depositing funds with other financial institutions or clearing and settlement systems • position limits and reporting rules for derivatives • governance and accountability regimes • conduct of business and control requirements , and • restrictions on compensation . these types of differences , inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require jpmorgan chase to : • divest assets or restructure its operations • maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity , or absorb increased capital and liquidity costs • incur higher operational and compliance costs • change the prices that it charges for its products and services • curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients • curtail other business opportunities , including acquisitions or principal investments , that it otherwise would have pursued • become subject to regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions , or • incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks . any or all of these factors could harm jpmorgan chase ’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws , rules and regulations or supervisory oversight , or harm jpmorgan chase ’s businesses , results of operations and profitability . resolving regulatory investigations can subject jpmorgan chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences , and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations . jpmorgan chase is subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions . jpmorgan chase has paid significant fines , provided other monetary relief , incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies . jpmorgan chase could become subject to similar regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in the future , and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in jpmorgan chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs , including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation or needing to comply with other restrictions . in connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions , certain regulators have required jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution . these types of admissions can lead to : • greater exposure in litigation • damage to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation • disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers , or in specific jurisdictions , or • other direct and indirect adverse effects . furthermore , government officials in the u.s . and other countries have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions . resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution , including : # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i • loss of clients , customers and business • restrictions on offering certain products or services , and • losing permission to operate certain businesses , either temporarily or permanently . jpmorgan chase expects that : • it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions • governmental authorities will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions , including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions , rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions ; and • governmental authorities will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against jpmorgan chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions . if jpmorgan chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action , or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators , it could be required to , among other things : • enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions • pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments , or • accept material regulatory restrictions on , or changes in the management of , its businesses . in these circumstances , jpmorgan chase could also become subject to other sanctions , or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action . in addition , jpmorgan chase can be subject to higher costs or requests for additional capital in connection with the resolution of governmental investigations and enforcement actions involving newly - acquired businesses , companies in which jpmorgan chase has made principal investments , parties to joint ventures with jpmorgan chase , and vendors with which jpmorgan chase does business . jpmorgan chase ’s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in jurisdictions with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks . jpmorgan chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries , states , municipalities , territories and other jurisdictions in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable , including with respect to : • the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions • conflicting or ambiguous laws , rules and regulations , or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws , rules and regulations • uncertainty concerning the enforceability of intellectual property rights or contractual or other obligations • difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses , or where graft or corruption may be pervasive • the threat of regulatory investigations , civil litigations or criminal prosecutions that are arbitrary or otherwise contrary to established legal principles in other parts of the world , and • the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies . if the application of the laws , rules and regulations in any jurisdiction is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes , this can create a more difficult environment in which jpmorgan chase conducts its business and could negatively affect jpmorgan chase ’s operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that jurisdiction . for example , conducting business could require jpmorgan chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding , and monitoring changes in , local laws , rules and regulations , as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws , rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures . there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws , rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates , and the risk of non - compliance can be greater in jurisdictions that have less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks . requirements for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase could result in jpmorgan chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses . jpmorgan chase is required under federal reserve and fdic rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy , without extraordinary government support , in the event of material financial distress or failure . the evaluation of jpmorgan chase ’s resolution plan by these agencies may change , and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time . any such determinations or modifications could result in jpmorgan chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities , which could increase its funding or operational costs , or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers . # # table_start # # table_end if the federal reserve and the fdic were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by jpmorgan chase has deficiencies , they could jointly impose more stringent capital , leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on jpmorgan chase ’s growth , activities or operations . the agencies could also require that jpmorgan chase restructure , reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s operations and strategy . holders of jpmorgan chase & co. ’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution . federal reserve rules require that jpmorgan chase & co. ( the “ parent company ” ) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long - term debt and other loss - absorbing capacity with specific terms ( “ eligible ltd ” ) for purposes of recapitalizing jpmorgan chase ’s operating subsidiaries if the parent company were to enter into a resolution either : • in a bankruptcy proceeding under chapter [XX] of the u.s . bankruptcy code , or • in a receivership administered by the fdic under title ii of the dodd - frank act ( “ title ii ” ) . if the parent company were to enter into a resolution , holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company will absorb the losses of the parent company and its subsidiaries . the preferred “ single point of entry ” strategy under jpmorgan chase ’s resolution plan contemplates that only the parent company would enter bankruptcy proceedings . jpmorgan chase ’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized , as needed , so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner . as a result , the parent company ’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the parent company ’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors , including holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities . claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chase ’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority ( as determined by statute ) and secured creditors of the parent company . accordingly , in a resolution of the parent company in bankruptcy , holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of the parent company would realize value only to the extent available to the parent company as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . and its other subsidiaries , and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the parent company have been fully repaid . the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution , such as the parent company , under title ii . however , the fdic has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy . if the parent company were to approach , or enter into , a resolution , none of the parent company , the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow jpmorgan chase ’s preferred resolution strategy , and losses to holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company , under whatever strategy is ultimately followed , could be greater than they might have been under jpmorgan chase ’s preferred strategy . political economic uncertainty or instability caused by political or geopolitical developments can negatively impact jpmorgan chase ’s businesses . political developments in the u.s . and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which jpmorgan chase operates its businesses . certain governmental policy initiatives , as well as heightened geopolitical tensions , could significantly affect u.s . and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets , including : • an outbreak or escalation of hostilities , or other geopolitical instabilities • monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities , including any sustained large - scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions • fiscal policies , including with respect to taxation and spending • actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of health emergencies , the spread of infectious diseases , epidemics or pandemics , as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken • governmental actions or initiatives relating to climate risk , or more generally , the impact of business activities on environmental , social and governance ( “ esg ” ) matters , and the management of climate and other esg - related risks • isolationist foreign policies • economic or financial sanctions • the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies , or • other governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures . these types of political developments , and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments , could : • erode investor confidence in the u.s . economy and financial markets , which could potentially undermine the status of the u.s . dollar as a safe haven currency # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i • provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in regulatory , enforcement or diplomatic relations • increase concerns about whether the u.s . government will be funded , and its outstanding debt serviced , at any particular time • lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the u.s . federal national mortgage association and the u.s . federal home loan mortgage corporation ( together , the “ u.s . gses ” ) • result in periodic shutdowns of the u.s . government or governments in other countries • increase investor reliance on actions by the federal reserve or other central banks , or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole • adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which jpmorgan chase does business , or • cause jpmorgan chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue . these factors could lead to : • slower growth rates , rising inflation or recession • greater market volatility • a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads • erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets • diminished investor and consumer confidence • lower investments in a particular country or sector of the economy • large - scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the u.s . and other countries • reduced commercial activity among trading partners • the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country • the possible departure of a country from , or the dissolution or formation of , a political or economic alliance or treaty • potential expropriation or nationalization of assets , including client assets , or • other market dislocations , including unfavorable economic conditions that could spread from a particular country or region to other countries or regions . any of these potential outcomes could cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses on its market - making positions or in its investment portfolio , reduce its liquidity and capital levels , increase the allowance for credit losses or lead to higher net charge - offs , hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers , and weaken its results of operations and financial condition or credit rating . jpmorgan chase 's business and results of operations may also be adversely affected by actions or initiatives by national , state or local governmental authorities that : • seek to discourage financial institutions from doing business with companies engaged in certain industries , or conversely , to penalize financial institutions that elect not to do business with such companies , or • mandate specific business practices that companies operating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt . because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ or conflict with those in other jurisdictions , jpmorgan chase may face negative consequences regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not to take , including : • restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a particular jurisdiction , or with governmental entities in a jurisdiction • the threat of enforcement actions , including under antitrust or other anti - competition laws , rules and regulations , and • harm to its reputation arising from public criticism , including from politicians , activists and other stakeholders . jpmorgan chase has been prohibited from engaging in certain business activities in specific jurisdictions as a result of these types of governmental actions , and there is no assurance that it will not face similar restrictions on its business and operations in the future . in addition , jpmorgan chase 's relationships or ability to transact with clients and customers , and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase does business , could be adversely affected if its decisions with respect to doing business with companies in certain sensitive industries are perceived to harm those companies or to align with particular political viewpoints . furthermore , jpmorgan chase 's participation in or association with certain environmental and social industry groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or governmental authorities as boycotting or other discriminatory business behavior . market economic and market events and conditions can materially affect jpmorgan chase ’s businesses and investment and market - making positions . jpmorgan chase ’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following : • investor , consumer and business sentiment • events that reduce confidence in the financial markets • inflation , deflation or recession # # table_start # # table_end • high unemployment or , conversely , a tightening labor market • the availability and cost of capital , liquidity and credit • levels and volatility of interest rates , credit spreads and market prices for currencies , equities and commodities , as well as the duration of any such changes • the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities , terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities , cyber attacks , climate change , natural disasters , severe weather conditions , health emergencies , the spread of infectious diseases , epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond jpmorgan chase ’s control , and • the strength of the u.s . and global economies . all of these are affected by global economic , market and political events and conditions , as well as regulatory restrictions . in addition , jpmorgan chase ’s investment portfolio and market - making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events , including : • severe declines in asset values • unexpected credit events • unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated ( and vice versa ) • the inability to effectively hedge risks related to market - making and investment portfolio positions , or • other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development , structuring or pricing of a financial instrument . if jpmorgan chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market - making activities , this could reduce jpmorgan chase ’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels , and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses . jpmorgan chase ’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies . jpmorgan chase ’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by u.s . and global economic conditions , including : • personal and household income distribution • unemployment or underemployment • prolonged periods of exceptionally high or low interest rates • changes in the value of collateral such as residential real estate and vehicles • changes in housing prices • the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services • consumer and small business confidence levels , and • changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt . heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts . in addition , sustained low growth , low or negative interest rates , inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by jpmorgan chase ’s consumer businesses . adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies , additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge - offs , which can reduce jpmorgan chase ’s earnings . these consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies , including where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment , or where high levels of consumer debt , such as outstanding student loans , could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations . jpmorgan chase ’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers , including : • policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance , education , immigration , employment status and housing • laws , rules and regulations relating specifically to the financial services industry , such as limitations on late payment , overdraft and interchange fees , and • policies aimed at the economy more broadly , such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income . unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase ’s wholesale businesses . in jpmorgan chase ’s wholesale businesses , market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients , and , therefore , the revenue that jpmorgan chase receives from those transactions . these factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that jpmorgan chase manages , such as loan syndications or securities underwriting . furthermore , if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur , the profitability of jpmorgan chase ’s businesses engaged in capital markets activities , including loan syndication , securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities , could be reduced to the extent that those businesses : • earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes , including when clients are unwilling or unable to # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions , or • dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss , or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that can not be sold at favorable prices . the fees that jpmorgan chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions . for example , higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuation of client assets that jpmorgan chase manages or holds under custody , which , in turn , could affect jpmorgan chase ’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody . similarly , adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from jpmorgan chase funds or accounts , or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue . substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a jpmorgan chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund , particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices , and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance . an adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy , such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices , severe declines in commercial real estate values , or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors , could have a material adverse effect on clients of jpmorgan chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors , as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses . jpmorgan chase could incur credit losses on its loans and other commitments to clients that operate in , or are dependent on , any sector of the economy that is or comes under stress . an economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chase ’s wholesale clients , and thereby diminish jpmorgan chase ’s earnings from its wholesale operations . for example , the businesses of certain of jpmorgan chase ’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties , including offices , which are owned or being built by those clients . sustained adverse economic conditions or hybrid work models could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which , in turn , could depress the values of the properties , impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans and lead to an increase in foreclosures . these consequences could result in jpmorgan chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses , higher delinquencies , defaults and charge - offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio . an increase in foreclosures could result in higher operational risk associated with jpmorgan chase owning and managing real property , and any inadequacy in governance or control over the foreclosed properties could result in regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm . changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s earnings , its liquidity or its capital levels . when interest rates are high or increasing , jpmorgan chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income . however , higher interest rates can also lead to : • fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans • losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client - specific downgrades , or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge - offs due to higher financing costs for clients • the loss of deposits , particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believe that interest rates offered by jpmorgan chase are lower than those of competitors or if jpmorgan chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior • losses on available - for - sale ( “ afs ” ) securities held in the investment securities portfolio • lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short - term and long - term borrowings • less liquidity in the financial markets , and • higher funding costs . all of these outcomes could adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels , and any negative outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates . higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within jpmorgan chase ’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates . if borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments , those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments , thereby causing jpmorgan chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans . on the other hand , a low or negative interest rate environment may cause : • net interest margins to be compressed , which could reduce the amounts that jpmorgan chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher - yielding instruments # # table_start # # table_end • unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior , which could negatively affect jpmorgan chase ’s broader asset and liability management strategy , and • a reduction in the value of jpmorgan chase ’s mortgage servicing rights ( “ msrs ” ) asset , decreasing revenues . when credit spreads widen , it becomes more expensive for jpmorgan chase to borrow . jpmorgan chase ’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to jpmorgan chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions . changes in jpmorgan chase ’s credit spreads will affect , positively or negatively , jpmorgan chase ’s earnings on certain liabilities , such as derivatives , that are recorded at fair value . jpmorgan chase ’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments . the value of securities , derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations . market volatility , illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments . subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods , in light of factors then prevailing , may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments . in addition , at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments , the price that jpmorgan chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value . any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets , which may have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase ’s results of operations . jpmorgan chase ’s risk management and monitoring processes , including its stress testing framework , seek to quantify and manage jpmorgan chase ’s exposure to more extreme market moves . however , jpmorgan chase ’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective , and it could incur significant losses , if extreme market events were to occur . credit jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients , counterparties , custodians and ccps . jpmorgan chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations , financial institutions , asset managers , hedge funds , securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the u.s . many of these transactions expose jpmorgan chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties , and can involve jpmorgan chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults . jpmorgan chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations , or where clients are unable to access assets held by jpmorgan chase as custodian due to governmental actions or other factors . a default by , or the financial or operational failure of , a ccp through which jpmorgan chase executes contracts would require jpmorgan chase to replace those contracts , thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses . in addition , jpmorgan chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a ccp in which jpmorgan chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the ccp because of requirements that each member of the ccp absorb a portion of those losses . furthermore , jpmorgan chase can be subject to bearing its share of non - default losses incurred by a ccp , including losses from custodial , settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches . as part of its clearing services activities , jpmorgan chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients , which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral . jpmorgan chase is also exposed to intra - day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management , clearing , custodial and other transaction services to those clients . if a client for which jpmorgan chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent , jpmorgan chase may incur losses , become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more ccps , the client ’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors , or be subject to regulatory investigations . all of the foregoing events can increase jpmorgan chase ’s operational and litigation costs , and jpmorgan chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses . transactions with government entities , including national , state , provincial , municipal and local authorities , can expose jpmorgan chase to enhanced sovereign , credit , operational and reputation risks . government entities may , among other things , claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government . these types of actions have in the past caused , and could in the future cause , jpmorgan chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction . in addition , local laws , rules and regulations could limit jpmorgan chase ’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed - upon payments , which could subject jpmorgan chase to losses . disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms , the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral . the disposition of those disputes could cause jpmorgan chase to incur unexpected transaction , operational and legal costs , or result in credit losses . these consequences can # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i also impair jpmorgan chase ’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities , or cause harm to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation . the financial or operational failure of a significant market participant , such as a major financial institution or a ccp , or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant or its ability to fulfill its obligations , can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets , including in circumstances where coordinated action by multiple other market participants is required to address the failure or disruption . jpmorgan chase ’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event , particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses , experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting , and jpmorgan chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with , and credit exposure to , such a significant market participant . jpmorgan chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions . during periods of market stress or illiquidity , jpmorgan chase ’s credit risk may be further increased when : • jpmorgan chase fails to realize the estimated value of the collateral it holds • collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it , or • counterparties are unable to post collateral , whether for operational or other reasons . furthermore , disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress , volatility or illiquidity , and jpmorgan chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral . jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk . jpmorgan chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties , or obligors on securities and other financial instruments : • engage in similar or related businesses , or in businesses in related industries • do business in the same geographic region , or • have business profiles , models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions . for example , a significant deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty , borrower or other obligor could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other counterparties , borrowers or obligors in similar , related or dependent industries . this type of interrelationship could exacerbate jpmorgan chase ’s credit , liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses , including fair value losses in its market - making businesses and investment portfolios . in addition , jpmorgan chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses or establish other reserves with respect to certain clients , industries or country exposures in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators . similarly , challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of counterparties , borrowers or other obligors not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries , wherever located . these conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of jpmorgan chase ’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to jpmorgan chase . jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion , but its ability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited . jpmorgan chase ’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non - bank competitors . heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry - wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less - creditworthy borrowers . if large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans , whether due to weak credit profiles , an economic downturn or other factors , this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to jpmorgan chase and result in higher charge - offs and other credit - related losses . more broadly , widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the u.s . economy , and jpmorgan chase ’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment . if jpmorgan chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation , this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk - weighted - assets ( “ rwa ” ) that jpmorgan chase holds on its balance sheet . these factors could adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s capital position , funding costs and the profitability of its businesses . liquidity jpmorgan chase ’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained . jpmorgan chase ’s liquidity can be impacted at any given time as a result of factors such as : • market - wide illiquidity or disruption • changes in liquidity or capital requirements resulting from changes in laws , rules and regulations , including those in response to economic effects of systemic events • actions taken by the u.s . government or by the federal reserve to reduce its balance sheet , which may reduce # # table_start # # table_end deposits held by jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions • inability to sell assets , or to sell assets at favorable times or prices • default by a ccp or other significant market participant • unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral • unexpected loss of deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending - related commitments , and • lack of market or customer confidence in jpmorgan chase or financial institutions in general . a reduction in jpmorgan chase ’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control . for example , periods of market stress , low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for jpmorgan chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity . jpmorgan chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower - cost sources of funding , such as deposits and borrowings from federal home loan banks , is reduced . alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability . jpmorgan chase ’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that jpmorgan chase may take in order to : • satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements • address obligations under its resolution plan , or • satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the u.s . relating to the pre - positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities . more generally , if jpmorgan chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity , this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries , and thereby adversely affect its results of operations . jpmorgan chase & co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities . jpmorgan chase & co. is a holding company that holds the stock of jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . and an intermediate holding company , jpmorgan chase holdings llc ( the “ ihc ” ) . the ihc in turn generally holds the stock of jpmorgan chase ’s subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . and its subsidiaries . the ihc also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the parent company . the parent company is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances ( including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock ) . the ability of jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . and the ihc to make payments to the parent company is also limited . jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions , as well as capital adequacy requirements , such as the supplementary leverage ratio ( “ slr ” ) , and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the parent company . the ihc is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the parent company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached , or if limits are otherwise imposed by the parent company ’s management or board of directors . as a result of these arrangements , the ability of the parent company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . and dividends and borrowings from the ihc . these limitations could affect the parent company ’s ability to : • pay interest on its debt securities • pay dividends on its equity securities • redeem or repurchase outstanding securities , and • fulfill its other payment obligations . these arrangements could also result in the parent company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . and the ihc are subject . reductions in jpmorgan chase ’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding . jpmorgan chase & co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies . rating agencies evaluate general , firm - specific and industry - specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution , including : • expected future profitability • risk management practices • legal expenses • ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non - bank subsidiaries • regulatory developments • assumptions about government support , and • economic and geopolitical developments . jpmorgan chase closely monitors and manages , to the extent that it is able , factors that could influence its credit ratings . however , there is no assurance that jpmorgan chase ’s credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future . furthermore , any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when jpmorgan chase ’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low . # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i a reduction in jpmorgan chase ’s credit ratings could curtail jpmorgan chase ’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways , including : • reducing its access to capital markets • materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities • triggering additional collateral or funding requirements , and • decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to jpmorgan chase . any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase & co. and its subsidiaries . this could , in turn , adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of jpmorgan chase & co. and its subsidiaries . capital maintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact jpmorgan chase ’s ability to support business activities , meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders . jpmorgan chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements , including leverage- and risk - based capital requirements . in addition , as a global systemically important bank ( “ gsib ” ) , jpmorgan chase is required to hold additional capital buffers , including a gsib surcharge , a stress capital buffer ( “ scb ” ) , and a countercyclical buffer , each of which is reassessed at least annually . the amount of capital that jpmorgan chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage- and risk - based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as : • actions by banking regulators , including changes in laws , rules , and regulations • changes in the composition of jpmorgan chase ’s balance sheet or developments that could increase rwa , such as increased market risk , customer delinquencies , client credit rating downgrades or other factors , and • increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the federal reserve under the comprehensive capital analysis and review , which could increase jpmorgan chase ’s scb . any failure by or inability of jpmorgan chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital , or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements , could have an adverse impact on jpmorgan chase ’s shareholders , such as : • reducing the amount of common stock that jpmorgan chase is permitted to repurchase • requiring the issuance of , or prohibiting the redemption of , capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with jpmorgan chase ’s capital management strategy • constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock , or • curtailing jpmorgan chase ’s business activities or operations . banking regulators have released a proposal to amend the basel iii risk - based capital framework which could significantly revise the risk - based capital requirements for banks with assets of $ [XXX] billion or more , including jpmorgan chase . uncertainty remains as to the manner in which these requirements will ultimately apply to jpmorgan chase , however it is possible that these requirements could impact jpmorgan chase ’s decisions concerning the business activities in which it will engage and its levels of capital distributions to its shareholders . operational jpmorgan chase ’s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of internal and external operational systems . jpmorgan chase ’s businesses rely on the ability of jpmorgan chase ’s financial , accounting , transaction execution , data processing and other operational systems to process , record , monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis , and to do so accurately , quickly and securely . in addition to proper design , installation , maintenance and training , the effective functioning of jpmorgan chase ’s operational systems depends on : • the quality of the information contained in those systems , as inaccurate , outdated , incomplete or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information , and • jpmorgan chase ’s ability to continue to maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis in line with technological advancements and evolving security requirements , carefully manage any changes introduced to its systems to maintain security and operational continuity , and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements , particularly in regions where jpmorgan chase may face a heightened risk of malicious activity . jpmorgan chase has experienced and expects that it will continue to experience failures and disruptions in the stability of its operational systems , including degraded performance of data processing systems , data quality issues , disruptions of network connectivity and malfunctioning software , as well as disruptions in its ability to access and use the operational systems of third parties . these incidents have resulted in various negative effects for customers , including the inability to access account information or to make transactions through atm , internet or mobile channels , the exfiltration of customer personal data , the recording of duplicative transactions and extended delays for customers requiring services from call # # table_start # # table_end centers . there can be no assurance that these and other types of operational failures or disruptions will not occur in the future . jpmorgan chase ’s ability to effectively manage the stability of its operational systems and infrastructure could be hindered by many factors , any of which could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chase and its clients , customers and counterparties , including : • jpmorgan chase ’s ability to effectively maintain and upgrade systems and infrastructure can become more challenging as the speed , frequency , volume , interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase • attempts by third parties to defraud jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers are increasing , evolving and becoming more complex , and during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty , these attempts can be expected to increase in volume • errors made by jpmorgan chase or another market participant , whether inadvertent or malicious , could cause widespread system disruption • failure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings in operational systems in a timely manner • isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems could compound , or migrate to other systems over time , to become larger issues • disruptions in operational systems or in the ability of systems to communicate with each other could be caused by failures in synchronization or encryption software , or degraded performance of microprocessors , and • attempts by third parties to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights . jpmorgan chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of third parties , including its custodians , vendors ( such as those that provide data and cloud computing services , and security and technology services ) and other market participants ( such as clearing and payment systems , ccps and securities exchanges ) , and external operational systems with which jpmorgan is connected , whether directly or indirectly , can be sources of operational risk to jpmorgan chase . jpmorgan chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which jpmorgan chase is directly connected , but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected . similarly , retailers , payment systems and processors , data aggregators and other external parties with which jpmorgan chase ’s customers do business can increase jpmorgan chase ’s operational risk . this is particularly the case where activities of customers or other parties are beyond jpmorgan chase ’s security and control systems , including through the use of the internet , cloud computing services , and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services . if an external party obtains access to customer account data on jpmorgan chase ’s systems , whether authorized or unauthorized , and that party misappropriates that data , this could result in negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers , including a heightened risk of fraudulent transactions using jpmorgan chase ’s systems , losses from fraudulent transactions and reputational harm arising from the perception that jpmorgan chase ’s systems may not be secure . as jpmorgan chase ’s interconnectivity with clients , customers and other external parties continues to expand , jpmorgan chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties . security breaches affecting jpmorgan chase ’s clients or customers , or systems breakdowns or failures , security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties , may require jpmorgan chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information , including restricting the access of customers to their accounts . these actions can increase jpmorgan chase ’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in jpmorgan chase . furthermore , the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions , clearing banks , ccps , payments processors , financial technology companies , securities exchanges , clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity , including due to a cyber attack , may cause industry - wide operational disruptions that could materially affect jpmorgan chase ’s ability to conduct business . in addition , the risks associated with the disruption of an operational system of a third party could be exacerbated to the extent that the services provided by that system are used by a significant number or proportion of market participants . the ineffectiveness , failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which jpmorgan chase depends , including due to a systems malfunction , cyber incident or other systems failure , could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers , including : • delays or other disruptions in providing services , including the provision of liquidity or information to clients and customers • impairment of jpmorgan chase ’s ability to execute transactions , including delays or failures in the confirmation or settlement of transactions or in obtaining access to funds or other assets required for settlement • the possibility that funds transfers , capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i • financial losses , including due to loss - sharing requirements of ccps , payment systems or other market infrastructures , or as possible restitution to clients and customers • higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that has experienced a failure or other disruption • limitations on jpmorgan chase 's ability to collect data needed for its business and operations • loss of confidence in the ability of jpmorgan chase , or financial institutions generally , to protect against and withstand operational disruptions • dissatisfaction among jpmorgan chase ’s clients or customers • significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions , and • harm to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation . if jpmorgan chase ’s operational systems , or those of acquired businesses or of external parties on which jpmorgan chase ’s businesses depend , are unable to meet the requirements of jpmorgan chase ’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards , or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings , jpmorgan chase could be materially and adversely affected . a successful cyber attack affecting jpmorgan chase could cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers . jpmorgan chase experiences numerous cyber attacks on its computer systems , software , networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors , including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries , cyber - criminals , “ hacktivists ” ( i.e. , individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change ) and others . these cyber attacks can take many forms , including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code , which are commonly referred to as “ malware , ” into jpmorgan chase ’s systems . these attacks are often designed to : • obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to jpmorgan chase or its clients , customers , counterparties or employees • manipulate data • destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable • disrupt , sabotage or degrade service on jpmorgan chase ’s systems • steal money , or • extort money through the use of so - called “ ransomware . ” jpmorgan chase also experiences : • distributed denial - of - service attacks intended to disrupt jpmorgan chase ’s websites , including those that provide online banking and other services , • a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions , and • a high volume of disruptions to internet - based services used by jpmorgan chase that are provided by third parties . jpmorgan chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past , and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future . any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers . a principal reason that jpmorgan chase can not provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate , detect or recognize threats to jpmorgan chase ’s systems , or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches because : • the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and are increasingly sophisticated , and therefore may not be recognized until launched or may go undetected for extended periods • cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources , including jpmorgan chase ’s own employees , cyber - criminals , hacktivists , well - resourced groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile nation - states that can sustain malicious activities for extended periods , or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally • jpmorgan chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients , customers , counterparties and third - party service providers with which it does business , and • it is possible that a third party , after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected , may gain access to other networks and systems . the risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as : • jpmorgan chase ’s ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet - based product offerings and its internal use of internet - based products and applications , including those that use cloud computing services • advances in artificial intelligence , such as the use of machine learning and generative artificial intelligence by malicious actors to develop more advanced social engineering attacks , including targeted phishing attacks • the inability to maintain the security of information transmitted by jpmorgan chase due to advances in quantum computing that may counteract or nullify existing information protections , and • the acquisition and integration of new businesses . # # table_start # # table_end in addition , a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by jpmorgan chase ’s employees . the dynamic nature of the cyber threat landscape necessitates continuous enhancement and adaptation of cybersecurity controls . failure to discover or address known vulnerabilities or shortcomings in cybersecurity controls , or to prioritize or complete enhancements to address them , in each case in a timely manner , may leave jpmorgan chase vulnerable to cyber attacks , potentially resulting in data breaches , financial losses , reputational damage and regulatory penalties , including the failure to prioritize or complete enhancements relating to : • preventing unauthorized access and protecting against the misuse of access , including the maintenance and enhancement of controls related to secure software development practices and identity and access management , such as those relating to the management of administrative access to systems • detecting , escalating and addressing effectively and in a timely manner any vulnerabilities that may be present either in internally - developed software or externally - provided software or services , including vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to exploit unknown security flaws in software and hardware ( “ zero - day vulnerabilities ” ) • enhancing early detection of attacks against third - party vendors , including attacks targeting vulnerabilities in third - party open - source software , in support of the secure development and maintenance of internal systems • maintaining and enhancing controls related to technology asset management and inventory systems to prevent the risk of undetected vulnerabilities that could undermine jpmorgan chase ’s ability to operate an effective control process • upgrading the coverage and capabilities of systems and controls to protect jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers from the impact of distributed denial - of - service attacks , or to recover from outages that could be caused by a malware or ransomware attack • strengthening network security and management of outbound connections to reduce the risk of data loss • identifying , assessing and mitigating insider threat activities that could lead to the misuse of jpmorgan chase ’s systems or client and customer information , and • integrating acquired businesses where system integration may be complex or may require extensive and lengthy remediation or enhancement of controls . a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of jpmorgan chase ’s systems or the systems of a vendor , governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences , including : • significant disruption of jpmorgan chase ’s operations and those of its clients , customers and counterparties , including losing access to operational systems • misappropriation of confidential information of jpmorgan chase or that of its clients , customers , counterparties , employees or regulators • disruption of or damage to jpmorgan chase ’s systems and those of its clients , customers and counterparties • the inability , or extended delays in the ability , to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen , manipulated or destroyed , or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions • demands that jpmorgan chase pay a ransom to a malicious actor that has perpetrated a cybersecurity breach • unintended violations by jpmorgan chase of applicable privacy and other laws • financial loss to jpmorgan chase or to its clients , customers , counterparties or employees • loss of confidence in jpmorgan chase ’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures • dissatisfaction among jpmorgan chase ’s clients , customers or counterparties • significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions , and • harm to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation . the extent of a particular cyber attack , the methods and tools used by various actors , and the steps that jpmorgan chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear , and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed . while such an investigation is ongoing , jpmorgan chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack , and that damage may continue to spread . these factors may inhibit jpmorgan chase ’s ability to provide rapid , full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients , customers , counterparties and regulators , as well as the public . furthermore , it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack , and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated . any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack . jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products , services and delivery platforms or the adoption of new technologies . when jpmorgan chase launches a new product or service , introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services ( including mobile connectivity , electronic trading and cloud computing ) , acquires or invests in a business , makes changes to an existing product , service # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i or delivery platform , or adopts a new technology , it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes , including increased reliance on third party providers , or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes . any significant failure in this regard could diminish jpmorgan chase ’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in : • potential liability to clients , counterparties and customers • higher compliance and operational cost • higher litigation costs , including regulatory fines , penalties and other sanctions • damage to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation • impairment of jpmorgan chase ’s liquidity • regulatory intervention , or • weaker competitive standing . any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s businesses and results of operations . jpmorgan chase ’s business and operations rely on its ability , and the ability of key external parties , to maintain appropriately - staffed workforces , and on the competence , trustworthiness , health and safety of employees . jpmorgan chase ’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably , to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers , and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence , trustworthiness , health and safety of its employees . jpmorgan chase 's businesses and operations similarly rely on the workforces of third parties , including employees of vendors , custodians and financial markets infrastructures , and of businesses that it may seek to acquire . jpmorgan chase ’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by : • the ineffective implementation of business decisions • any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities , or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls • staffing shortages , particularly in tight labor markets • the possibility that significant portions of jpmorgan chase ’s workforce are unable to work effectively , including because of illness , quarantines , shelter - in - place arrangements , government actions or other restrictions in connection with health emergencies , the spread of infectious diseases , epidemics or pandemics , or due to extraordinary events beyond jpmorgan chase ’s control such as natural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities • a significant operational breakdown or failure , theft , fraud or other unlawful conduct , or • other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of jpmorgan chase or of another party on which jpmorgan chase ’s businesses or operations rely . jpmorgan chase ’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to protect the health and safety of its employees are ineffective , or if any external party on which jpmorgan chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees . jpmorgan chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in the processing and safeguarding of personal information . jpmorgan chase ’s businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws , rules and regulations , both within and outside the u.s . , governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals . governmental authorities around the world have adopted and are considering the adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy , data protection and security . litigation or enforcement actions relating to these laws , rules and regulations could result in fines or orders requiring that jpmorgan chase change its data - related practices , which could have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chase ’s ability to provide products and otherwise harm its business operations . implementing processes relating to jpmorgan chase ’s collection , use , sharing and storage of personal information to comply with all applicable laws , rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions , including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict , can : • increase jpmorgan chase ’s compliance and operating costs • hinder the development of new products or services , curtail the offering of existing products or services , or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers • demand significant oversight by jpmorgan chase ’s management , and • require jpmorgan chase to structure its businesses , operations and systems in less efficient ways . not all of jpmorgan chase ’s clients , customers , vendors , counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality , integrity or availability of the information exchanged between them and jpmorgan chase , particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means . jpmorgan chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients , customers , employees or others were to be mishandled or misused , such as situations where such information is : # # table_start # # table_end • erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information , or • intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties . concerns regarding the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase ’s measures to safeguard personal information , or the perception that those measures are inadequate , could cause jpmorgan chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers or employees , and thereby reduce jpmorgan chase ’s revenues . furthermore , any failure or perceived failure by jpmorgan chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws , rules and regulations , or any failure to appropriately calibrate , manage and monitor access by employees or third parties to personal information , could subject jpmorgan chase to inquiries , examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices , significant liabilities or regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions . any of these could damage jpmorgan chase ’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses . in recent years , well - publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection , use , sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the processing or safeguarding of personal information by companies in the u.s . and other countries . that scrutiny has in some cases resulted in , and could in the future lead to , the adoption of stricter laws , rules and regulations relating to the collection , use , sharing and storage of personal information . these types of laws , rules and regulations can prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase from transferring information across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors , thereby increase compliance costs and operational risk , or restrict jpmorgan chase ’s use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to customers . some countries are considering or have adopted legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of jpmorgan chase ’s delivery of products and services . these restrictions could also inhibit jpmorgan chase ’s development or marketing of certain products or services , or increase the costs of offering them to customers . jpmorgan chase ’s operations , results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control . jpmorgan chase ’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted , and its reputation could be harmed , by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control , including material instances of : • cyber attacks • security breaches of its physical premises , including threats to health and safety • power , telecommunications or internet outages , or shutdowns of mass transit • failure of , or loss of access to , technology or operational systems , including any resulting loss of critical data • damage to or loss of property or assets of jpmorgan chase or third parties , and any consequent injuries , including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by jpmorgan chase • effects of climate change • natural disasters or severe weather conditions • accidents such as explosions or structural failures • health emergencies , the spread of infectious diseases , epidemics or pandemics , or • events arising from local or larger - scale civil or political unrest , any outbreak or escalation of hostilities , or terrorist acts . jpmorgan chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is designed to enable it to prepare for , adapt to , withstand and recover from business disruptions that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets , including staff , technology , third party service providers and facilities , in the event of a business disruption , including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control . there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase ’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business resiliency risks to jpmorgan chase , its clients , and customers and third parties with which it does business , or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events . in addition , jpmorgan chase ’s ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce , physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed , or conversely , if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated . further , should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic , the disruptive effects of those events on jpmorgan chase ’s business and operations , and on its clients , customers , counterparties and employees , could become more significant and long - lasting . any significant failure or disruption of jpmorgan chase ’s operations or operational systems , or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control , could : • hinder jpmorgan chase ’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties • require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event • cause it to incur losses or liabilities , including from loss of revenue , damage to or loss of property , or injuries # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i • disrupt market infrastructure systems on which jpmorgan chase ’s businesses rely • expose it to litigation or regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions , and • harm its reputation . the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events could also negatively impact the financial condition or creditworthiness of jpmorgan chase ’s clients and customers , and could lead to an increase in delinquencies , additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge - offs , which can reduce jpmorgan chase ’s earnings . jpmorgan chase ’s acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of first republic bank may not result in all of the benefits anticipated . on may [X] , [XXXX] , jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of first republic bank from the fdic ( the “ first republic acquisition ” ) . actual results associated with the first republic acquisition may differ from the anticipated positive results , including with respect to : • the settlement of the final purchase price • the total cost of integration • the time required to complete the integration • the overall performance of the assets and liabilities acquired in the first republic acquisition , or • an improved price for jpmorgan chase ’s common stock . integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly , and involves the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls , as well as managing relevant relationships with employees , clients , suppliers and other business partners . the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards , controls , procedures and policies that could adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s ability to maintain relationships with clients and customers . in addition , the loss of key employees in connection with the first republic acquisition could adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s ability to successfully conduct its business . jpmorgan chase could also incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the first republic acquisition , including if jpmorgan chase fails to comply with the conditions of the shared - loss agreements with the fdic related to certain loans and lending - related commitments , which could diminish the coverage of the credit losses these agreements are designed to provide . enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures . jpmorgan chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers , including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries . jpmorgan chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers . jpmorgan chase ’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships , especially those involving significant banking functions , shared services or other critical activities , could materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase . specifically , any such failure could result in : • potential harm to clients and customers , and any liability associated with that harm • regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions • lower revenues , and the opportunity cost from lost revenues • increased operational costs , or • harm to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation . jpmorgan chase ’s risk management framework and control environment may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to jpmorgan chase . any inadequacy or lapse in jpmorgan chase ’s risk management framework , governance structure , practices , models or reporting systems , or in its control environment could expose it to unexpected losses , and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected . any such inadequacy or lapse could : • hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to jpmorgan chase ’s senior management and board of directors • lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase • require significant resources and time to remediate • lead to non - compliance with laws , rules and regulations • attract heightened regulatory scrutiny • expose jpmorgan chase to litigation , regulatory investigations or regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions • lead to potential harm to customers and clients , and any liability associated with that harm • harm its reputation , or • otherwise diminish confidence in jpmorgan chase . jpmorgan chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures . any deficiencies in the accuracy , timeliness or completeness of data , or the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase ’s data gathering , analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices . these deficiencies could also result in inaccurate or untimely risk reporting . # # table_start # # table_end many of jpmorgan chase ’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management ’s subjective judgment or assumptions . for example , many models used by jpmorgan chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators . in times of market stress , including difficult or less liquid market environments , or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances , previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated . conversely , previously - correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times . sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could , in some circumstances , limit the effectiveness of jpmorgan chase ’s risk management strategies , causing it to incur losses . jpmorgan chase could recognize unexpected losses , its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models , estimations or judgments , including those used in its financial statements , are inadequate or incorrect . jpmorgan chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment - based estimations to measure , monitor and implement controls over its market , credit , capital , liquidity , operational and other risks . jpmorgan chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under u.s . generally accepted accounting principles ( “ u.s . gaap ” ) . these models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends , and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary . the models and estimations that jpmorgan chase uses , including those that use machine learning , artificial intelligence or quantum computing , may not be effective in all cases to identify , observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors , such as : • reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future , including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices • inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes • historical trend information may be incomplete , or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility , dislocation or lack of liquidity • sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments • technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected , or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology • models and estimations may contain erroneous data , valuations , formulas or algorithms , and • review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations . jpmorgan chase may experience unexpected losses if models , estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements are inadequate or incorrect . for example , where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value , jpmorgan chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment . in addition , jpmorgan chase may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired differ from those used to develop those models , which may lead to unexpected losses . similarly , jpmorgan chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires significant judgments , including forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability of jpmorgan chase ’s clients and customers to repay their loans or other obligations . these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors , including when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed . the increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that jpmorgan chase may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case . some of the models and other analytical and judgment - based estimations used by jpmorgan chase in managing risks are subject to review by , and require the approval of , jpmorgan chase ’s regulators . these reviews are required before jpmorgan chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk rwa , credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under basel iii . if jpmorgan chase ’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators , it may be subject to higher capital charges , which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses . lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect jpmorgan chase ’s profitability or reputation . jpmorgan chase ’s businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws , rules and regulations , both within and outside the u.s . , requiring continuous enhancements to various disclosures in its financial statements and regulatory reports . there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase ’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance , or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur . any such lapses or deficiencies could result in inaccurate financial reporting which , in turn , could : # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i • materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s business and results of operations or financial condition • restrict its ability to access the capital markets • require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies • expose it to litigation or regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions • harm its reputation , or • otherwise diminish investor confidence in jpmorgan chase . strategic if jpmorgan chase ’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies , and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies , jpmorgan chase ’s competitive standing and results could suffer . jpmorgan chase ’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations . these strategies relate to : • the products and services that jpmorgan chase offers • the geographies in which it operates • the types of clients and customers that it serves • the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests • the counterparties with which it does business , and • the methods , distribution channels and third party service providers by or through which it offers products and services . if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect , are based on incomplete , inaccurate or fraudulent information , do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends , or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients , customers , investors , employees and other stakeholders , then the franchise values and growth prospects of jpmorgan chase ’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline . jpmorgan chase ’s growth prospects also depend on management ’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities , both in the near term and over longer time horizons . management ’s effectiveness in this regard will affect jpmorgan chase ’s ability to develop and enhance its resources , control expenses and return capital to shareholders . each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to : • devise effective business plans and strategies • offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers • allocate capital in a manner that promotes long - term stability to enable jpmorgan chase to build and invest in market - leading businesses , even in a highly stressed environment • allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations • appropriately assess and monitor principal investments made to enhance or accelerate jpmorgan chase 's business strategies • conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective business acquisitions or investments , or effectively integrate newly - acquired businesses • appropriately address concerns of clients , customers , investors , employees and other stakeholders , including with respect to climate and other esg matters • react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures , or • develop and enhance the operational , technology , risk , financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage jpmorgan chase ’s businesses . furthermore , jpmorgan chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties , premises and facilities , and those costs could be material to its results of operations . jpmorgan chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry . jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to changes in financial regulation , technological advances , increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions . jpmorgan chase expects that competition in the u.s . and global financial services industry will continue to be intense . competitors include : • other banks and financial institutions • trading , advisory and investment management firms • finance companies • technology companies , and • other non - bank firms that are engaged in providing similar as well as new products and services . jpmorgan chase can not provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations . for example , aggressive or less disciplined lending practices by non - bank competitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks , and in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial services industry and adversely impact other market participants , including jpmorgan chase . new competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge . for example , technological advances and the growth of e - commerce have made it possible for non- # # table_start # # table_end depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products . these advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet - based financial solutions , including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading , lending and other extensions of credit to consumers , payments processing and online automated algorithmic - based investment advice . furthermore , both financial institutions and their non - banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services , including deposits and other traditional banking products , could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies , such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers , that may not require intermediation . new technologies have required and could require jpmorgan chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors , including technology companies . in addition , new technologies may be used by customers , or breached or infiltrated by third parties , in unexpected ways , which can increase jpmorgan chase ’s costs for complying with laws , rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that jpmorgan chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies . ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for jpmorgan chase ’s products and services or may cause jpmorgan chase to lose market share , particularly with respect to traditional banking products . this competition may be based on quality and variety of products and services offered , transaction execution , innovation , reputation and price . the failure of any of jpmorgan chase ’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers , whether due to general market conditions , under - performance , a decision not to offer a particular product or service , changes in client and customer expectations or other factors , could affect jpmorgan chase ’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers . any such impact could , in turn , reduce jpmorgan chase ’s revenues . increased competition also may require jpmorgan chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses , or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients to remain competitive . the effects of climate change could adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s business and operations , both directly and as a result of impacts on its clients and customers . jpmorgan chase operates in many regions , countries and communities around the world where its business , and the activities of its clients and customers , could be adversely affected by climate change . climate change could manifest as a financial risk to jpmorgan chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low - carbon economy . both physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change could have negative impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness of jpmorgan ’s clients and customers , and on its exposure to those clients and customers . physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events , such as floods , wildfires and tropical cyclones , and chronic shifts in the climate , such as persistent changes in precipitation levels , rising sea levels , or increases in average ambient temperature . potential adverse impacts of climate - related physical risks include : • declines in asset values , including due to the destruction or degradation of property • reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of jpmorgan chase • interruptions to business operations , including supply chain disruption , and • population migration or unemployment in affected regions . transition risks arise from societal adjustment to a low - carbon economy , such as changes in public policy , adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low - carbon goods and services . these risks could also be influenced by changes in the physical climate . potential adverse impacts of transition risks include : • sudden devaluation of assets , including unanticipated write - downs ( “ stranded assets ” ) • increased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy • increased energy costs driven by governmental actions and initiatives such as emission pricing and accelerated decarbonization policies • negative consequences to business models , and the need to make changes in response to those consequences , and • damage to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation , including due to any perception that its business practices are contrary to public policy or the preferences of different stakeholders . climate risks can also arise from inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and financial regulations are implemented in the many regions where jpmorgan chase operates , including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect . additionally , internal models and estimations used in climate risk assessments have an increased level of uncertainty due to limited historical trend information and the absence of standardized , reliable and comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions data , which could lead to inaccurate disclosures or financial reporting . conduct conduct failure by jpmorgan chase employees can harm clients and customers , impact market integrity , damage jpmorgan chase ’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action . # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i jpmorgan chase ’s employees interact with clients , customers , counterparties and other market and industry participants , and with each other , every day . all employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of jpmorgan chase ’s code of conduct and business principles , including jpmorgan chase ’s commitment to “ do first class business in a first class way . ” jpmorgan chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee ’s life cycle , including recruiting , onboarding , training and development , and performance management . conduct risk management is also an integral component of jpmorgan chase ’s promotion and compensation processes . notwithstanding these expectations , policies and practices , certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past . these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation , and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders , deferred prosecution agreements , non - prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions . there is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees have not occurred or will not occur , lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions ( and associated consequences ) , or that any such actions will always be detected , deterred or prevented . jpmorgan chase ’s reputation could be harmed , and collateral consequences could result , from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with jpmorgan chase ’s expectations , policies and practices , including by acting in ways that harm clients , customers , other market participants , employees or others . some examples of this include : • improperly selling and marketing jpmorgan chase ’s products or services • engaging in insider trading , market manipulation or unauthorized trading • engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs • facilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax , accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities , or where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction • failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers • violating antitrust or anti - competition laws by colluding with other market participants • using electronic communications channels that have not been approved by jpmorgan chase • engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients , customers or employees , or acting contrary to jpmorgan chase ’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace • managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate jpmorgan chase ’s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives , and • misappropriating property , confidential or proprietary information , or technology assets belonging to jpmorgan chase , its clients and customers or third parties . the consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with jpmorgan chase ’s expectations , policies or practices could include litigation , or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions . any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other sanctions , or lead to : • financial losses • increased operational and compliance costs • greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties • regulatory actions that require jpmorgan chase to restructure , curtail or cease certain of its activities • the need for significant oversight by jpmorgan chase ’s management • loss of clients or customers , and • harm to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation . the foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newly - acquired businesses if jpmorgan chase fails to successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in accordance with jpmorgan chase 's expectations , policies and practices . reputation damage to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation could harm its businesses . maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients , customers , investors and employees . damage to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase ’s business and prospects , and can arise from numerous sources , including : • employee misconduct , including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients , customers or employees , or actions that are contrary to jpmorgan chase ’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace • security breaches , including as a result of cyber attacks • failure to safeguard client , customer or employee information • failure to manage risks associated with its client relationships , or with transactions or business activities in which jpmorgan chase or its clients engage , including transactions or activities that may be unpopular among one or more constituencies # # table_start # # table_end • failure to meet publicly - announced commitments to support esg initiatives • non - compliance with laws , rules , and regulations • operational failures • litigation or regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions • actions taken in executing regulatory and governmental requirements during a global or regional health emergency , spread of infectious disease , epidemic or pandemic • regulatory investigations or enforcement actions , or resolutions of these matters , and • failure or perceived failure to comply with laws , rules or regulations by jpmorgan chase or its clients , customers , counterparties or other parties , including newly - acquired businesses , companies in which jpmorgan chase has made principal investments , parties to joint ventures with jpmorgan chase , and vendors with which jpmorgan chase does business . jpmorgan chase ’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding jpmorgan chase , whether or not true , that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media , non - mainstream news services or other parts of the internet , or that may be disseminated through disinformation campaigns targeted at jpmorgan chase . this latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels . social and environmental activists have been increasingly targeting jpmorgan chase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning their business practices , including business relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries , such as companies : • whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health , or • whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment , workers ’ rights or communities . activists have also taken actions intended to change or influence jpmorgan chase ’s business practices with respect to esg matters , including public protests at jpmorgan chase ’s headquarters and other properties , and submitting specific esg - related proposals for a vote by jpmorgan chase ’s shareholders . in addition , jpmorgan chase and other companies have been and continue to be criticized by activists , politicians and other members of the public concerning positions taken with respect to matters of public policy . these criticisms can be more widespread during election years in various jurisdictions , and could have the effect of focusing attention on a company such as jpmorgan chase as part of a wider public debate on public policy matters . these and other types of criticism and actions directed at jpmorgan chase could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients , customers , investors , employees , government officials and other stakeholders . in all of these cases , jpmorgan chase ’s reputation and its business and results of operations could be harmed by : • greater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies , or further criticism from politicians and other members of the public • unfavorable coverage or commentary in the media , including through social media campaigns • certain clients and customers ceasing doing business with jpmorgan chase , and encouraging others to do so • impairment of jpmorgan chase ’s ability to attract new clients and customers , to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers , or to hire or retain employees , or • certain investors opting to divest from investments in securities of jpmorgan chase . actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect jpmorgan chase ’s reputation . for example , the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that : • consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution , or • a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers . if jpmorgan chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors , this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers , employees or other stakeholders . failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions , as well as damage jpmorgan chase ’s reputation . jpmorgan chase ’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions , obligations and interests with and among jpmorgan chase ’s clients and customers . jpmorgan chase can become subject to litigation , enforcement actions , and heightened regulatory scrutiny , and its reputation can be damaged , by the failure or perceived failure to : • adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest , including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in , or having one or more investments related to , the same transaction • identify and address any conflict of interest that a third party with which it is does business may have with respect to a transaction involving jpmorgan chase • deliver appropriate standards of service and quality # # table_start [XX] # # table_end part i • treat clients and customers fairly and with the appropriate standard of care • use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations • provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards , or • handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately and in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws , rules and regulations . a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction , litigation and regulatory fines , penalties or other sanctions , and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions , all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to jpmorgan chase ’s reputation . country an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on jpmorgan chase ’s businesses within the affected region or globally . aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups , including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks , could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full - scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences , particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons . depending on the scope of the conflict , the hostilities could result in : • worldwide economic disruption • heightened volatility in financial markets • severe declines in asset values , accompanied by widespread sell - offs of investments • sudden increases in prices in the energy and commodity markets or for certain safe haven currencies • substantial depreciation of local currencies , potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region • disruption of global trade , and • diminished consumer , business and investor confidence . any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on jpmorgan chase ’s operations and earnings , both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally . further , if the u.s . were to become directly involved in such a conflict , this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that jpmorgan chase may have in the affected countries or region , as well as in any nation that is aligned against the u.s . in the hostilities . jpmorgan chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict . jpmorgan chase ’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic , political , regulatory and social factors . some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political , legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which jpmorgan chase operates . in addition , in some jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase conducts business , the local economy and business activities are subject to substantial government influence or control . some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions , including : • extreme currency fluctuations • high inflation • low or negative growth • defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt a nd • increased fraud or other misrepresentation of value . the governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment , such as : • price , capital or exchange controls , including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange • expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property , including intellectual property , and • changes in laws , rules and regulations . the impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller , less liquid and more volatile than more - developed markets . these types of government actions can negatively affect jpmorgan chase ’s operations in the relevant country , either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi - national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction . in addition , emerging markets countries , as well as more developed countries , have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions , including : • widespread demonstrations , civil unrest or general strikes • crime and corruption • security and personal safety issues • an outbreak or escalation of hostilities , or other geopolitical instabilities • overthrow of incumbent governments • terrorist attacks , and # # table_start # # table_end • other forms of internal discord . these economic , political , regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in , and in the future could lead to , conditions that can adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues , growth and profitability of those operations . in addition , any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect jpmorgan chase ’s operations and investments in another country or countries , including in the u.s . people jpmorgan chase ’s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success . jpmorgan chase ’s employees are its most important resource , and in many areas of the financial services industry , competition for qualified personnel is intense . jpmorgan chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain , develop and motivate its existing employees . jpmorgan chase 's efforts to hire and retain talented and diverse employees could be hindered by factors such as : • the emerging need for more - skilled workers in an evolving labor and workplace environment , including due to changes in technology , and • targeted recruitment of jpmorgan chase employees by competitors . if jpmorgan chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees , including successors to the chief executive officer , members of the operating committee and other senior leaders , jpmorgan chase ’s performance , including its competitive position , could be materially and adversely affected . jpmorgan chase ’s use of hybrid work models could result in deterioration in employee performance or degradation of jpmorgan chase 's control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its business and operations . alternatively , discontinuing hybrid work models could harm jpmorgan chase ’s ability to attract and retain employees . unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s businesses and operations . jpmorgan chase relies on the skills , knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world . changes in immigration or travel policies in the u.s . and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in , or travel to or transfer between , jurisdictions in which jpmorgan chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit jpmorgan chase ’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees , and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce , or could prompt jpmorgan chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly . legal jpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations . jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings , including class actions , derivative actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties , as well as criminal proceedings . actions currently pending against jpmorgan chase may result in judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other sanctions adverse to jpmorgan chase . any of these matters could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chase ’s business , financial condition or results of operations , or cause serious reputational harm . as a participant in the financial services industry , it is likely that jpmorgan chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations . regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams , and jpmorgan chase ’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight . this heightened regulatory scrutiny , or the results of such an investigation or examination , may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions . there is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against jpmorgan chase . furthermore , a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings , either by multiple federal , state or local agencies and officials in the u.s . or , in some instances , regulators and other governmental officials in non - u.s . jurisdictions . if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice , this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by jpmorgan chase . these and other initiatives by u.s . and non - u.s . governmental authorities may subject jpmorgan chase to judgments , settlements , fines , penalties or other sanctions , and may require jpmorgan chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services . all of these potential outcomes could harm jpmorgan chase ’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs , thereby reducing jpmorgan chase ’s profitability , or result in collateral consequences . in addition , the extent of jpmorgan chase ’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could , in some cases , exceed the amount of reserves that jpmorgan chase has established for those matters . # # table_start [XX] # # table_end"

making , including financial education information sessions , live and on - demand webinars , articles and interactive digital tools . global reach and strategic locations as a firm with a global client base , we take a strategic approach to attracting , developing and managing a global workforce . our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world . as of december [XXXX] , we had headcount of [XX,XXX] , offices in over [XX] countries , and [XX] % of our headcount was based in the americas , [XX] % in europe , middle east and africa ( emea ) and [XX] % in asia . our employees come from over [XXX] countries and speak more than [XXX] languages as of december [XXXX] . in addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers around the world , we have established key strategic locations , including in bengaluru , salt lake city , dallas , singapore , warsaw and hyderabad . we continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations , including cities in which we do not currently have a presence . as of december [XXXX] , [XX] % of our employees were working in strategic locations . we believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives . sustainability we have a long - standing commitment to sustainability . our two priorities in this area are helping clients across industries decarbonize their businesses to support their transition to a low - carbon economy ( climate transition ) and to advance solutions that expand access , increase affordability , and drive outcomes to support sustainable economic growth ( inclusive growth ) . our strategy is to advance these two priorities through our work with our clients , and with strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own , as well as through our supply chain . we established a sustainable finance group ( sfg ) , which serves as the centralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts across our firm , including commercial efforts alongside our businesses , to advance climate transition and inclusive growth . since establishing sfg , our sustainable finance - related efforts have continued to evolve . for example , within global banking & markets , we established the sustainable banking group , a group focused on supporting our corporate clients in reducing their direct and indirect carbon emissions . within asset & wealth management there are multiple teams that specialize in sustainable investing . the sustainability & impact solutions team in asset & wealth management also helps mobilize the full range of insights , advisory services and investment solutions across our asset management client segments . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [X] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our activities relating to sustainability present both financial and nonfinancial risks , and we have processes for managing these risks , similar to the other risks we face . we have integrated oversight of climate - related risks into our risk management governance structure , from senior management to our board and its committees , including the risk and public responsibilities committees . the risk committee of the board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks , which include climate risk , and , as part of its oversight , receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk . the public responsibilities committee of the board assists the board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us , including with respect to climate change . as part of its oversight , the public responsibilities committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy , and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change - related matters . we have also implemented an environmental policy framework to guide our overall approach to sustainability issues . we apply this framework when evaluating transactions for environmental and social risks and impacts . our employees also receive training with respect to environmental and social risks , including for sectors and industries that we believe have higher potential for these risks . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk management — other risk management — climate -

balance sheet sustainable finance activity . we believe we can advance sustainability by partnering with our clients across our businesses , including by developing new sustainability - linked financing solutions , offering strategic advice , or co - investing alongside our clients in clean energy companies . we have announced a target to deploy $ [XXX] billion in sustainable financing , investing and advisory activity by the beginning of [XXXX] . as of december [XXXX] , we achieved approximately [XX] % of that goal , with the majority dedicated to climate transition . with respect to climate transition , we have announced our commitment to align our financing activities with a net - zero - by-2050 pathway . in that context , we have set an initial set of [XXXX] targets for our energy , power and auto manufacturing portfolios , three sectors where we see an opportunity to proactively engage our clients and investors , deploy capital required for transition , and invest in new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy . carbon neutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm and our supply chain . in [XXXX] , we achieved carbon neutrality in our operations and business travel , ahead of our [XXXX] goal announced in [XXXX] . we have expanded our operational carbon commitment to include our supply chain , targeting net - zero carbon emissions by [XXXX] . in addition to climate transition , our approach to sustainability also centers on inclusive growth where we seek to help drive solutions that expand access , increase affordability , and support outcomes to advance sustainable economic growth . commercial solutions that seek to support inclusive growth include , among others , those of our urban investment group and our sustainable investing group . we also seek to support inclusive growth through sponsored initiatives , such as one million black women , [XX,XXX] women and [XX,XXX] small businesses . an overarching theme of our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity and inclusion as an imperative for us , as well as for our clients and their boards . these efforts are further strengthened by strategic partnerships that we have established in areas where we have identified gaps or believe we are able to drive even greater impact through collaboration . we believe our ability to achieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent on the strengths and talents of our people , and we recognize that our people are able to maximize their impact by collaborating in a diverse and inclusive work environment . see “ business — human capital management ” for information about our human capital management goals , programs and policies . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries competition the financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive , and we expect them to remain so . our competitors provide investment banking , market - making and asset management services , private banking and lending , commercial lending , credit cards , transaction banking , deposit - taking and other banking products and services , and make investments in securities , commodities , derivatives , real estate , loans and other financial assets . our competitors include brokers and dealers , investment banking firms , commercial banks , credit card issuers , insurance companies , investment advisers , mutual funds , hedge funds , private equity funds , merchant banks , consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet - based companies . some of our competitors operate globally and others regionally , and we compete based on a number of factors , including transaction execution , client experience , products and services , innovation , reputation and price . we have faced , and expect to continue to face , pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks . in particular , corporate clients seek such commitments ( such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities ) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments . consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets . as a result , we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions . to capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities , we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the u.s . we also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services , such as independent advisory firms . some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are , and , as described below , our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them . a number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition . efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking , market - making , consumer , wealth management and asset management businesses . for example , the increasing volume of trades executed electronically , through the internet and through alternative trading systems , has increased the pressure on trading commissions , in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non - electronic trading . it appears that this trend toward low - commission trading will continue . price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it ( i.e. , bid / offer spread ) , which has affected our market - making businesses . the increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services . in addition , we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices , and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution . we and other banks also compete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer . increases in short - term interest rates have resulted in and may continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing , as well as competition from non - deposit financial products . we also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer . in some circumstances , our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer , including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we can not or may choose not to provide . our competitors may also develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] -

frank act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between u.s.-based and non - u.s.-based banking organizations and give non - u.s.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the u.s . and to form and invest in funds outside the u.s . likewise , the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under title vii of the dodd - frank act depend , in part , on the location of the counterparties to the transaction . the impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve , the extent of international convergence , and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes , as described further in “ regulation ” below . we also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees . our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees , retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions , including in jurisdictions such as new york state where we are required to publish certain compensation information as part of the employee hiring process . our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by , and the standards of , the frb and other regulators inside and outside the u.s . , including the prudential regulation authority ( pra ) and the financial conduct authority ( fca ) in the u.k . we also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight . see “ regulation — compensation practices ” and “ risk factors — competition — our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees ” in part i , item 1a of this form [XX] -

, among others . banking supervision and regulation the basel committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation . however , the basel committee ’s standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards . the implications of basel committee standards and related regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally , and the market practices and structures that develop . capital and liquidity requirements . we and gs bank usa are subject to risk - based regulatory capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the frb ( capital framework ) . the capital framework is largely based on the basel committee ’s framework for strengthening the regulation , supervision and risk management of banks ( basel iii ) and also implements certain provisions of the dodd - frank act . under the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies ’ tailoring framework , we and gs bank usa are subject to “ category i ” standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank ( g - sib ) . accordingly , we and gs bank usa are “ advanced approach ” banking organizations . under the capital framework , we and gs bank usa must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off - balance sheet items . the sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators . we and gs bank usa are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies . gsbe is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the e.u . capital requirements regulation , as amended ( crr ) , and the e.u . capital requirements directive , as amended ( crd ) , which are largely based on basel iii . the crr requires large institutions with securities traded on a regulated market of a member state to make qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to environmental , social and governance risks on a semi - annual basis . these requirements will apply to our e.u.-regulated entities beginning in january [XXXX] . gsi and gsib are subject to the u.k . capital and liquidity frameworks prescribed in the pra rulebook and the u.k . capital requirements regulation , which are also largely based on basel iii and are generally aligned with the e.u . capital and liquidity frameworks . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries risk - based capital ratios . as advanced approach banking organizations , we and gs bank usa calculate risk - based capital ratios in accordance with both the standardized and advanced capital rules . both the standardized and advanced capital rules include minimum risk - based capital requirements and additional capital conservation buffer requirements that must be satisfied solely with common equity tier [X] ( cet1 ) capital . failure to satisfy a buffer requirement in full would result in constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation . the severity of the constraints would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the organization ’s “ eligible retained income , ” defined as the greater of ( i ) net income for the four preceding quarters , net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income ; and ( ii ) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters . for group inc . , the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a [X.X] % buffer ( under the advanced capital rules ) , a stress capital buffer ( scb ) ( under the standardized capital rules ) , and both a countercyclical buffer and the g - sib surcharge ( under both capital rules ) . for gs bank usa , the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a [X.X] % buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer . in july [XXXX] , the frb issued a proposal to implement a revised g - sib assessment methodology and to revise certain systemic indicators to be based on daily or monthly average values during each year , instead of year - end values . the scb is based on the results of the federal reserve ’s supervisory stress tests and our planned common stock dividends and is likely to change over time based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests . see “ stress tests and capital planning ” below . the countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to category i , ii or iii standards , including us and gs bank usa . several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers . the g - sib surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us may change in the future , including due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes . as a result , the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted a rule that implements the basel committee ’s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts ( sa - ccr ) . under the rule , “ advanced approach ” banking organizations are required to use sa - ccr in the calculation of their standardized risk - weighted assets ( rwas ) and , with some adjustments , in the determination of their supplementary leverage ratios ( slrs ) discussed below . the capital requirements applicable to gsbe , gsi and gsib include both minimum requirements and buffers . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital ” in part ii , item [X] of this form 10‑k and note [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form 10‑k for information about our capital ratios and those of gs bank usa , gsbe , gsi and gsib . the basel committee standards include guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective ( d - sibs ) . depending on how these guidelines are implemented by national regulators , they may apply to certain subsidiaries of g - sibs . these guidelines are in addition to the framework for g - sibs , but are more principles - based . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have not designated any d - sibs . the crd and crr provide that institutions that are systemically important at the e.u . or member state level , known as other systemically important institutions ( o - siis ) , may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements , according to their degree of systemic importance ( o - sii buffers ) . bafin has identified gsbe as an o - sii in germany and set an o - sii buffer . in the u.k . , the pra has identified goldman sachs group uk limited ( gsg uk ) , the parent company of gsi and gsib , as an o - sii but has not applied an o - sii buffer . the basel committee has finalized revisions to the basel iii capital requirements ( basel iii revisions ) , and in july [XXXX] , the u.s . bank regulatory agencies proposed a rule implementing the basel iii revisions and the fundamental review of the trading book ( frtb ) . the frtb , among other things , revises the standardized and internal model - based approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the proposed effective date for the u.s . proposal is july [X] , [XXXX] , with a three - year transition period for the calculation of expanded risk - based approach rwas . the proposal includes the replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded risk - based approach , which eliminates the use of internal models to calculate rwas for credit and operational risk . the proposal incorporates the application of the scb requirements in the expanded risk - based approach . the credit risk component of the expanded risk - based approach would include new risk weights for many counterparty and exposure types , a revised collateral haircut approach for certain collateralized transactions and additional restrictions for recognizing collateral in certain securities financing transactions . under the proposed rules , the rwas for operational risk would be calculated primarily based on revenues and historical losses . in addition , the proposal introduces the frtb , which would replace the market risk rule for both the standardized and expanded risk - based approaches and introduce a new credit valuation adjustment ( cva ) risk rwa calculation for the expanded risk - based approach . we continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed rules , but we preliminarily estimate that under these rules , if adopted as proposed and if our assets and liabilities remain largely consistent with those as of december [XXXX] , our regulatory capital requirements could increase by approximately [XX] % on a fully phased - in basis . the european commission has proposed rules to implement the basel iii revisions and the frtb , and the council of the e.u . has published the consolidated version reflecting the e.u . trilogue agreement . the agreed e.u . proposal contemplates amendments to the crr and the crd , referred to as crr iii and crd vi , generally taking effect in january [XXXX] . the proposed amendments include revised rules for market risk capital , a new standardized approach for operational risk and cva risk capital and a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach , commonly known as the “ output floor . ” in december [XXXX] , the pra issued near final market risk rules for the u.k . which are expected to be effective from july [X] , [XXXX] . the pra also issued its consultation on the implementation of the basel iii revisions , with a proposed effective date of july [X] , [XXXX] . under the pra consultation , our u.k . subsidiaries are not expected to be subject to a floor on internally modeled capital requirements . the pra has also published near final rules for cva risk , counterparty credit risk and operational risk , in addition to market risk . the basel committee has published an updated securitization framework and a revised g - sib assessment methodology . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies ’ july [XXXX] proposal would implement the updated securitization framework . the updated securitization framework has been implemented in the e.u . and u.k . the basel committee has also published a final standard on the prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures . the basel committee contemplates that national regulators will have incorporated the standard into local capital requirements by january [X] , [XXXX] . u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies and e.u . and u.k . authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the standards . leverage ratios . under the capital framework , we and gs bank usa are subject to tier [X] leverage ratios and slrs established by the frb . as a g - sib , the slr requirements applicable to us include both a minimum requirement and a buffer requirement , which operates in the same manner as the risk - based buffer requirements described above . in april [XXXX] , the frb and the occ issued a proposed rule which would ( i ) replace the current [X] % slr buffer for g - sibs , including us , with a buffer equal to [XX] % of their g - sib surcharge and ( ii ) revise the [X] % slr requirement for category i banks , such as gs bank usa , to be “ well capitalized ” with a requirement equal to [X] % plus [XX] % of their parent ’s g - sib surcharge . gsbe and certain of our u.k . entities are also subject to requirements relating to leverage ratios , which are generally based on the basel committee leverage ratio standards . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k and note [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for information about our and gs bank usa ’s tier [X] leverage ratios and slrs , and gsi ’s leverage ratio . liquidity ratios . the basel committee ’s framework for liquidity risk measurement , standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests : the liquidity coverage ratio ( lcr ) and the net stable funding ratio ( nsfr ) . the lcr rule issued by the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and gs bank usa is generally consistent with the basel committee ’s framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered , high - quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short - term liquidity stress scenario . we and gs bank usa are required to maintain a minimum lcr of [XXX] % . gsbe is subject to the lcr rule approved by the european parliament and council , and gsi and gsib are subject to the u.k . regulatory authorities ’ lcr rules , which are generally consistent with the basel committee ’s framework . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the nsfr is designed to promote medium- and long - term stable funding of the assets and off - balance sheet activities of banking organizations over a one - year time horizon . the basel committee ’s nsfr framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum nsfr of [XXX] % . we and gs bank usa are subject to the u.s . nsfr rule and we are required to disclose the quarterly average of our daily nsfr on a semi - annual basis . the crr implements the nsfr for certain e.u . financial institutions , including gsbe . the nsfr requirement implemented in the u.k . is applicable to both gsi and gsib . the frb ’s enhanced prudential standards require bhcs with $ [XXX] billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards , which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for [XX] days , and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management . although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the lcr , it is a separate requirement . gsbe also has its own liquidity planning process , which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under german regulatory requirements and the ecb guide to internal liquidity adequacy assessment process ( ilaap ) . gsi and gsib have their own liquidity planning processes , which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the pra ’s ilaap . see

. stress tests and capital planning . the frb ’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ( ccar ) is designed to ensure that large bhcs , including us , have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress . as required by the frb , we perform an annual capital stress test and incorporate the results into an annual capital plan , which we submit to the frb for review . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital — capital management — capital planning and stress testing process ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about our annual capital plan . as described in “ available information ” below , summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website . as part of the ccar process , the frb evaluates our plan to make capital distributions across a range of macroeconomic and company - specific assumptions , based on our and the frb ’s own stress tests . under the frb ’s rule applicable to bhcs with $ [XXX] billion or more in total consolidated assets , including us , the scb applies to the standardized approach capital requirements . the scb reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the ccar stress tests , as calculated by the frb , and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends . the scb , which is subject to a [X.X] % floor , is generally effective on october [X] of each year and remains in effect until october [X] of the following year , unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission of a capital plan . see “ available information ” below and “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital ” in part ii , item [X] of this form 10‑k for information about our scb requirement . the scb rule requires a bhc to receive the frb ’s approval for any dividend , stock repurchase or other capital distribution , other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument , if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan , which may occur if the bhc determines there has been or will be a “ material change ” in its risk profile , financial condition or corporate structure since the plan was last submitted , or if the frb directs the bhc to revise and resubmit its capital plan . u.s . depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $ [XXX] billion or more that are subsidiaries of u.s . g - sibs , such as gs bank usa , are required to submit annual company - run stress test results to the frb . gsbe also has its own capital and stress testing process , which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under german regulatory requirements and the ecb guide to internal capital adequacy assessment process ( icaap ) . in addition , gsi and gsib have their own capital planning and stress testing processes , which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the pra ’s icaap guidelines . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form

net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years , unless the entity obtains regulatory approval . under the undivided profits test , a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity ’s undivided profits ( generally , accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus ) , unless the entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval . the applicable u.s . banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if , in the banking regulator ’s opinion , payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization . source of strength . the dodd - frank act requires bhcs to act as a source of strength to their u.s . bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries . this support may be required by the frb at times when bhcs might otherwise determine not to provide it . capital loans by a bhc to a u.s . subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank . in addition , if a bhc commits to a u.s . federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary , whether in response to the frb ’s invoking its source - of - strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures , that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the bhc and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment , ahead of other creditors of the bhc . transactions between affiliates . transactions between gs bank usa or its subsidiaries , including gsbe , and group inc . or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the federal reserve act and regulations issued by the frb . these laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions ( such as loans and other credit extensions , including credit exposure arising from resale agreements , securities borrowing and derivative transactions , from gs bank usa or its subsidiaries to group inc . or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by gs bank usa or its subsidiaries from group inc . or its other subsidiaries and affiliates ) that may take place and generally require those transactions , to the extent permitted , to be on market terms or better to gs bank usa or its subsidiaries . these laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between gs bank usa and its subsidiaries . similarly , german regulatory requirements provide that certain transactions between gsbe and gs bank usa or its other affiliates , including group inc . , must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements . pra rules also provide requirements for transactions between gsi and gsib and their respective affiliates . resolution and recovery plans . we are required by the frb and the fdic to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure ( resolution plan ) . if these regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan or that its resolution plan , after any permitted resubmission , is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the u.s . bankruptcy code , they may jointly impose more stringent capital , leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth , activities or operations , or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations , in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure . the frb and fdic require u.s . g - sibs to submit resolution plans every two years ( alternating between submissions of full plans and targeted plans that include only select information ) . we submitted our [XXXX] resolution plan , which was a full submission , in june [XXXX] . our next required submission is a targeted submission by july [X] , [XXXX] . see “ risk factors — legal and regulatory — the application of group inc . ’s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for group inc . ’s security holders ” in part i , item 1a of this form [XX] - k and “ available information ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about our resolution plan . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we are also required by the frb to submit , on a periodic basis , a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk , maintain sufficient liquidity and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress . certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to similar recovery plan requirements . gs bank usa is required to provide a resolution plan to the fdic that must , among other things , demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities . gs bank usa ’s most recent resolution plan was submitted in december [XXXX] . in august [XXXX] , the fdic proposed to revise its current rule that requires the submission of resolution plans by insured depository institutions ( idis ) with $ [XX] billion or more in total assets . the proposal would revise the requirements regarding the content and timing of resolution submissions , as well as interim supplements to those submissions provided to the fdic . under the proposal , idis with $ [XXX] billion or more in total assets , including gs bank usa , would submit full resolution plans biennially . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts ( qfcs ) entered into by g - sibs . the rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed g - sib by limiting the ability of the g - sib to enter into a qfc unless ( i ) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the g‑sib or one of its affiliates into resolution , ( ii ) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement , and ( iii ) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the dodd - frank act orderly liquidation authority ( ola ) and the federal deposit insurance act of [XXXX] ( fdia ) , described below . gs bank usa has achieved compliance by adhering to the international swaps and derivatives association universal resolution stay protocol ( isda universal protocol ) and international swaps and derivatives association [XXXX] u.s . resolution stay protocol ( u.s . isda protocol ) described below . certain of our other subsidiaries also adhere to these protocols . the isda universal protocol imposes a stay on certain cross - default and early termination rights within standard isda derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction , including a resolution under ola or the fdia in the u.s . the u.s . isda protocol , which was based on the isda universal protocol , was created to allow market participants to comply with the final qfc rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies . the e.u . bank recovery and resolution directive ( brrd ) , as amended by the brrd ii , establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the e.u . , such as gsbe . the brrd provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre - emptively address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers ’ exposure to losses . the brrd requires e.u . member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and , where relevant , e.u . resolution authorities , including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity . financial institutions in the e.u . must provide that contracts governed by non - e.u . law recognize those temporary stay and bail - in powers unless doing so would be impracticable . gsbe is under the direct authority of the single resolution board for resolution planning . e.u . law requires financial institutions in the e.u . , including subsidiaries of non - e.u . groups , to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the e.u . entities . gsbe ’s primary regulator with respect to recovery planning is the ecb , and it is also regulated by bafin and deutsche bundesbank . the u.k . special resolution regime confers substantially the same powers on the bank of england , as the u.k . resolution authority , and substantially the same requirements on u.k . financial institutions . further , certain u.k . financial institutions , including gsi and gsib , are required to meet the bank of england ’s expectations contained in the u.k . resolution assessment framework , including with respect to loss absorbency , contractual stays , operational continuity and funding in resolution . they are also required by the pra to submit solvent wind - down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment . the pra is also the regulatory authority in the u.k . that supervises recovery planning , and gsi and gsib are each required to submit recovery plans to the pra . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries total loss - absorbing capacity ( tlac ) . the frb ’s tlac rule , among other things , establishes minimum tlac requirements and establishes minimum requirements for “ eligible long - term debt ” ( i.e. , debt that is unsecured , has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria ) . in august [XXXX] , the frb proposed to introduce a minimum denomination requirement for eligible long - term debt , among other changes . the rule also prohibits a bhc that has been designated as a u.s . g - sib from ( i ) guaranteeing subsidiaries ’ liabilities that are subject to early termination provisions if the bhc enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding , subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the u.s . federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on qfcs ; ( ii ) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries ; ( iii ) issuing short - term debt to third parties ; or ( iv ) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties . additionally , the rule caps , at [X] % of the value of the parent company ’s eligible tlac , the amount of unsecured non - contingent third - party liabilities that are not eligible long - term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long - term debt . the crr , the brrd and u.k . financial services regime also impose minimum tlac requirements on g - sibs . for example , the crr requires e.u . subsidiaries of a non - e.u . g - sib that exceed the threshold of [X] % of the g - sib ’s rwas , operating income or leverage exposure , such as gsbe , to meet internal tlac requirements . under the u.k . financial services regime , gsg uk exceeds the applicable thresholds and therefore , it is subject to internal tlac requirements . the crd required a non - e.u . group with more than € [XX] billion of assets in the e.u . , such as us , to establish an e.u . intermediate holding company ( e.u . ihc ) by december [XX] , [XXXX] if it has , as in our case , two or more of certain types of e.u . financial institution subsidiaries , including broker - dealers and banks . a non - e.u . group may have two e.u . ihcs if a request for a second is approved , and in september [XXXX] , the ecb granted gsbe and gspic an exemption to operate under two e.u . ihcs . the crr requires e.u . ihcs to satisfy capital and liquidity requirements , a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities ( mrel ) , and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level . the u.k . has not implemented a similar requirement to establish an ihc ; however , the pra has introduced a requirement that certain u.k . financial holding companies or a designated u.k . group entity be responsible for the u.k . group ’s regulatory compliance . we have designated gsi for that responsibility . the brrd ii and the u.k . resolution regime subject institutions to an mrel , which is generally consistent with the financial stability board ’s ( fsb ’s ) tlac standard . gsi is required to maintain a minimum level of internal mrel and provide the bank of england the right to exercise bail - in triggers over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by gsi . these triggers enable the bank of england to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity . the triggers can be exercised by the bank of england if it determines that gsi has reached the point of non - viability and the frb and the fdic have not objected to the bail - in or if group inc . enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings . the single resolution board imposes internal mrel requirements applicable to gsbe . insolvency of a bhc or idi . the dodd - frank act created a resolution regime , ola , for bhcs and their affiliates that are systemically important . under ola , the fdic may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non - bank subsidiaries if , upon the recommendation of applicable regulators , the u.s . secretary of the treasury determines , among other things , that the institution is in default or in danger of default , that the institution ’s failure would have serious adverse effects on the u.s . financial system and that resolution under ola would avoid or mitigate those effects . if the fdic is appointed as receiver under ola , then the powers of the receiver , and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution , would be determined under ola , and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply . the powers of the receiver under ola are generally based on the powers of the fdic as receiver for depository institutions under the fdia , described below . substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between ola and the u.s . bankruptcy code , including the right of the fdic under ola to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances , the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors ’ claims ( as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings ) , and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a “ bridge ” entity . in addition , ola limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross - defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership . the fdic has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed fhc by transferring its assets to a “ bridge ” holding company under its “ single point of entry ” or “ spoe ” strategy pursuant to ola . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries under the fdia , if the fdic is appointed as conservator or receiver for an idi such as gs bank usa , upon its insolvency or in certain other events , the fdic has broad powers , including the power : • to transfer any of the idi ’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor , including a newly formed “ bridge ” bank , without the approval of the depository institution ’s creditors ; • to enforce the idi ’s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the fdic in that capacity ; or • to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the idi is a party , the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the repudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the idi . in addition , the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an idi would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims , including deposits at non - u.s . branches and claims of debtholders of the idi , in the “ liquidation or other resolution ” of such an institution by any receiver . as a result , whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of gs bank usa , the debtholders ( other than depositors at u.s . branches ) would be treated differently from , and could receive , if anything , substantially less than , the depositors at u.s . branches of gs bank usa . deposit insurance . deposits at gs bank usa have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits . the fdic ’s deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on idis . gs bank usa ’s assessment ( subject to adjustment by the fdic ) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period , its supervisory ratings and specified forward - looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate . in addition , the fdic must recover , by special assessment , losses to the fdic deposit insurance fund as a result of the fdic ’s use of the systemic risk exception to the least cost resolution test under the fdia . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — operating expenses ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for information about the estimated impact of the fdic special assessment fee . the deposits of gsbe are covered by the german statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law . in addition , gsbe has elected to participate in the german voluntary deposit protection program which provides further insurance for certain eligible deposits beyond the coverage of the german statutory deposit program . eligible deposits at gsib and the london branch of gs bank usa are covered by the u.k . financial services compensation scheme up to the applicable limits . prompt corrective action . the u.s . federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of [XXXX] ( fdicia ) requires the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies to take “ prompt corrective action ” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements . fdicia establishes five capital categories for fdic - insured banks , such as gs bank usa : well - capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized . an institution may be downgraded to , or deemed to be in , a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters . fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations , management and capital distributions , as the capital category of an institution declines . failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital . ultimately , critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator , as described in “ insolvency of an idi or a bhc ” above . the prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to bhcs . however , the frb is authorized to take appropriate action at the bhc level , based upon the undercapitalized status of the bhc ’s depository institution subsidiaries . in certain instances , relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary , the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary ’s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee . furthermore , in the event of the bankruptcy of the bhc , the guarantee would take priority over the bhc ’s general unsecured creditors , as described in “ source of strength ” above . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries volcker rule and other restrictions on activities . as a bhc , we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we may engage . volcker rule . the volcker rule prohibits “ proprietary trading , ” but permits activities such as underwriting , market making and risk - mitigation hedging , requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record - keeping requirements . in addition , the volcker rule limits the sponsorship of , and investment in , “ covered funds ” ( as defined in the rule ) by banking entities , including us . it also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds , similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates . covered funds include our private equity funds , certain of our credit and real estate funds , our hedge funds and certain other investment structures . the limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to [X] % or less of the fund ’s net asset value , and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to [X] % or less of our tier [X] capital . other restrictions . fhcs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for bhcs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for fhcs . the broader range of permissible activities for fhcs includes underwriting , dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non - fhcs ( merchant banking activities ) . in addition , certain fhcs , including us , are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the u.s . that may otherwise be impermissible for bhcs , so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal [X] % or more of their consolidated assets . the frb , however , has the authority to limit an fhc ’s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible , and will likely do so if the fhc does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the frb . for example , if an fhc or any of its u.s . depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well - capitalized or well - managed , the frb may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements , as well as additional limitations or conditions . if the deficiencies persist , the fhc may be required to divest its u.s . depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities . in addition , we are required to obtain prior frb approval before certain acquisitions and before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the u.s . u.s . g - sibs , like us , are also required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits , which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions . the new york state banking law imposes lending limits ( which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions ) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of gs bank usa ’s activities . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high - level principles for safe - and - sound leveraged lending , including underwriting standards , valuation and stress testing . this guidance has , among other things , limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions . as a german credit institution , gsbe is subject to volcker rule - type prohibitions under german banking law and regulations because its financial assets exceed certain thresholds . prohibited activities include ( i ) proprietary trading , ( ii ) high - frequency trading at a german trading venue , and ( iii ) lending and guarantee businesses with german hedge funds , german funds of hedge funds or any non - german substantially leveraged alternative investment funds , unless an exclusion or an exemption applies . as part of its implementation of the basel iii revisions , the e.u . is introducing new restrictions on the provision of certain “ core ” banking services cross - border into the e.u . and new requirements on e.u . branches of third - country banks , such as the german branch of gsib . u.k . banks that have over £ [XX] billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities , commonly known as “ ring - fencing . ” gsib is not currently subject to the ring - fencing requirement . in september [XXXX] , the treasury department of the u.k . government proposed to increase the ring - fencing deposit threshold from £ [XX] billion to £ [XX] billion of core retail deposits . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries community reinvestment act ( cra ) . in [XXXX] , gs bank usa ceased to be assessed as a “ wholesale bank ” for cra and new york community reinvestment act ( nycra ) compliance purposes . gs bank usa instead adopted a strategic plan that was approved by the frb and nydfs . the [XXXX] strategic plan will be in effect through [XXXX] . while the plan is in effect , its terms will not be impacted by the revised federal cra regulations , jointly published by the fdic , frb , and occ in october [XXXX] . the revised federal cra regulations tailor cra evaluations to bank size and type , with many of the changes applying only to banks with over $ [X] billion in assets and several applying only to banks with over $ [XX] billion in assets , including gs bank usa . the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution ’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community , but depository institutions may only receive cra credit for certain types of lending and for lending , investments and services that support community development , as defined in the cra regulations . the cra and its regulations require each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency , in connection with its examination of a depository institution , to assess such institution ’s record of meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that institution , including the needs of low- and moderate - income borrowers and neighborhoods , and to make such assessment available to the public . the assessment also is part of the frb ’s consideration of applications to acquire , merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company , to assume deposits of or acquire assets from another depository institution , to establish a new domestic branch office that will accept deposits , or to relocate an office . in the case of a bhc applying for approval to acquire a bank or another bhc , the frb will assess the records of performance under the cra of the idis involved in the transaction , and such records may be the basis for denying the application . if gs bank usa fails to maintain at least a “ satisfactory ” rating under the cra , it would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions . we are also subject to provisions of the new york banking law that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon new york state - chartered banks , such as gs bank usa , to serve the credit needs of its local community ( nycra ) . such obligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the cra . the nycra requires the nydfs to make a periodic written assessment of an institution ’s compliance with the nycra , and to make such assessment available to the public . the nycra also requires the nydfs to consider the nycra rating when reviewing an application to engage in certain transactions , including mergers , asset purchases and the establishment of domestic branch offices , and provides that such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application . broker - dealer and securities regulation our broker - dealer subsidiaries , including gs&co . , are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business , including sales methods , trade practices , the use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities , capital structure , record - keeping , the financing of clients ’ purchases , and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . in the u.s . , the sec is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws . u.s . state securities and other u.s . regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over gs&co . for a description of net capital requirements applicable to gs&co . , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital — subsidiary capital requirements — u.s . regulated broker - dealer subsidiaries ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. the sec has adopted a rule , effective january [X] , [XXXX] , that requires lenders of securities to provide the material terms of securities lending transactions to finra and for finra to make certain terms publicly available . reporting under this rule will be required beginning in january [XXXX] . the sec requires broker - dealers to act in the best interest of their retail customers . sec rules require broker - dealers to provide a standardized , short - form disclosure highlighting services offered , applicable standards of conduct , fees and costs , the differences between brokerage and advisory services , and any conflicts of interest . in addition , several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to broker - dealers . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries in december [XXXX] , the sec issued four proposals to reform the u.s . equity market structure . the sec proposed establishing a broker - dealer best execution standard , which would require broker - dealers to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the best market for a customer order so that the resultant price to the customer is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions . the best execution standard applies to all securities and supplements , but does not replace , the existing finra and municipal securities rulemaking board ( msrb ) best execution rules . the sec also proposed , among other things , to require that individual investor orders routed through broker - dealers be exposed to order - by - order competition in qualified auctions ; to update the minimum pricing increments , with variable price increments based on the trading characteristics of stocks ; and to revise and expand reporting and disclosure requirements relating to execution quality . in june [XXXX] , finra issued a proposal that would require certain broker - dealers , including gs&co . to meet certain liquidity requirements and to establish a liquidity risk management program , including conducting liquidity stress testing and maintaining a contingency funding plan , and comply with notification and reporting requirements . the sec , finra and regulators in various non - u.s . jurisdictions have imposed both conduct - based and disclosure - based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations . in november [XXXX] , the sec adopted a rule that prohibits participants involved in the creation of asset - backed securities , including any underwriter , placement agent , initial purchaser or sponsor of an asset - backed security ( or any affiliate or subsidiary ) , from engaging in any transaction that involves or results in a material conflict of interest between the securitization participant and an investor in an asset - backed security , including reducing its exposure to the asset - backed securities , subject to certain exceptions . in december [XXXX] , the sec adopted a rule that necessitates sec - registered clearing agencies to set up policies and procedures that would , among other things , require many market participants to clear cash and repurchase treasury securities transactions through such a clearing agency by december [XXXX] for cash transactions and by june [XXXX] for repurchase transactions . gs&co . and other u.s . subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by u.s . federal agencies pursuant to the dodd - frank act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset - backed securities transactions to retain a portion ( generally , at least five percent ) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party . for certain securitization transactions , retention by third - party purchasers may satisfy this requirement . in europe , we provide broker - dealer services , including through gsbe , gspic and gsi , that are subject to oversight by european and national regulators . these services are regulated in accordance with e.u . , u.k . and other national laws and regulations . these laws require , among other things , compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity standards , customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules . certain of our european subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities , derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members . in the e.u . and the u.k . , the european markets in financial instruments directive ( mifid ii ) and the european markets in financial instruments regulation ( mifir ) established trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade otc derivatives on a trading platform , enhanced pre- and post - trade transparency covering a wide range of financial instruments , placed volume caps on non - transparent liquidity trading for equities trading venues , limited the use of broker - dealer equities crossing networks and created a regime for systematic internalizers , which are investment firms that execute client equity transactions outside a trading venue . additional control requirements apply to algorithmic trading , high frequency trading and direct electronic access . commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific position limits . mifid ii and mifir also require enhanced transaction reporting , the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues , transparency on costs and charges of service to investors , restrictions on the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research , rules limiting the payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms of inducements , and mandatory unbundling for broker - dealers between execution and other major services . certain of our non - u.s . subsidiaries , including gsbe and gsi , are subject to risk retention requirements in connection with securitization activities . gsjcl , our regulated japanese broker - dealer , is subject to capital requirements imposed by japan ’s financial services agency . gsjcl is also regulated by the tokyo stock exchange , the bank of japan and the ministry of finance , among others . the securities and futures commission in hong kong , the china securities regulatory commission , the reserve bank of india , the securities and exchange board of india , the australian securities and investments commission , the australian securities exchange , the monetary authority of singapore , the korean financial supervisory service and the central bank of brazil , among others , regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the u.s . regulators . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our exchange - based market - making activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges . as a market maker on exchanges , we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned . swaps , derivatives and commodities regulation the commodity futures , commodity options and swaps industry in the u.s . is subject to regulation under the u.s . commodity exchange act ( cea ) . the cftc is the u.s . federal agency charged with the administration of the cea . in addition , the sec is the u.s . federal agency charged with the regulation of security - based swaps . the rules and regulations of various self - regulatory organizations , such as the chicago mercantile exchange , other futures exchanges and the national futures association ( nfa ) , also govern commodity futures , commodity options and swaps activities . the terms “ swaps ” and “ security - based swaps ” include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps ( including certain forward contracts and options ) , and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations , including currencies , commodities , interest or other monetary rates , yields , indices , securities , credit events , loans and other financial obligations . cftc rules require registration of swap dealers , mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real - time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all in - scope swaps . a number of these requirements , particularly those regarding recordkeeping and reporting , also apply to transactions that do not involve a registered swap dealer . gs&co . and other subsidiaries , including gs bank usa , gsbe , gsi and j. aron , are registered with the cftc as swap dealers . the cftc has rules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator , such as the frb . the cftc also has financial reporting requirements for covered swap entities and capital rules for cftc - registered futures commission merchants that provide explicit capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security - based swaps that are not cleared by a clearing organization . certain of our registered swap dealers , including j. aron , are subject to the cftc ’s capital requirements . our affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the cftc ( in the case of our non - bank swap dealers ) and the frb ( in the case of gs bank usa and gsbe ) . inter - affiliate transactions under the cftc and frb margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements . our affiliates registered as swap dealers are also subject to nfa regulation , including requirements pertaining to cybersecurity and supervision , and the nfa examines them for compliance with these requirements as well as compliance with cftc rules . sec rules govern the registration and regulation of security - based swap dealers . security - based swaps are defined as swaps on single securities , single loans or narrow - based baskets or indices of securities . the sec has

, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees , by other regulatory bodies worldwide . the fsb has released standards for implementation by local regulators that are designed to encourage sound compensation practices at banks and other financial companies . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have also provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices . the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements : ( i ) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ; ( ii ) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management ; and ( iii ) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance . the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated , as appropriate , into the organization ’s supervisory ratings , which can

arrangements or related risk management , control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization ’s safety and soundness . the dodd - frank act requires u.s . financial regulators , including the frb and sec , to adopt rules on incentive - based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $ [X] billion in total assets . the u.s . financial regulators proposed

environmental , social and governance ( esg ) policymakers , lawmakers and regulators in the u.s . and other jurisdictions have recently increased their focus on esg - related risk oversight , disclosure , and practices at financial institutions and other companies . in october [XXXX] , the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued principles for climate - related financial risk management for large financial institutions , which apply to regulated financial institutions with more than $ [XXX] billion in total consolidated assets , including us . the principles are intended

, procedures , and limits ; ( [X] ) strategic planning ; ( [X] ) risk management ; ( [X] ) data , risk measurement , and reporting ; and ( [X] ) scenario analysis . in september [XXXX] , the sec

goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the following are detailed descriptions of our risk factors summarized above : market our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and broader economic conditions . many of our businesses , by their nature , do not produce predictable earnings , and all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally , both directly and through their impact on client activity levels and creditworthiness . these conditions can change suddenly and negatively . our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate . a favorable business environment is generally characterized by , among other factors , high global gross domestic product growth , regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent , liquid and efficient capital markets , low inflation , business , consumer and investor confidence , stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings . unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by : low levels of or declines in economic growth , business activity or investor , business or consumer confidence ; concerns over a potential recession ; changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns ; pandemics ; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital ; illiquid markets ; increases in inflation , interest rates , exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates ; high levels of inflation or stagflation ; concerns about sovereign defaults ; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy , government shutdowns , debt ceilings or funding ; the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes ; limitations on international trade and travel ; laws and regulations that limit trading in , or the issuance of , securities of issuers outside their domestic markets ; outbreaks or worsening of domestic or international tensions or hostilities , terrorism , nuclear proliferation , cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication , energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty ; corporate , political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets ; extreme weather events or other natural disasters ; or a combination of these or other factors . the financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes , by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults . in addition , concerns about actual or potential increases in interest rates , inflation and other borrowing costs , a public health emergency , sovereign debt risk and its impact on the relevant sovereign banking system , and limitations on international trade , have , at times , negatively impacted the levels of client activity . general uncertainty about economic , political and market activities , and the scope , timing and impact of regulatory reform , as well as weak consumer , investor and ceo confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty , has in the past negatively impacted client activity , which has in the past adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect many of our businesses . periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market - making businesses . changes , or proposed changes , to u.s . international trade and investment policies , particularly with important trading partners , have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets . continued or escalating tensions may result in further actions taken by the u.s . or other countries that could disrupt international trade and investment and adversely affect financial markets . those actions could include , among others , the implementation of sanctions , tariffs or foreign exchange measures , the large - scale sale of u.s . treasury securities or other restrictions on cross - border trade , investment , or transfer of information or technology . such developments have in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our or our clients ’ businesses . financial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained . in addition , liquidity in the financial markets has in the past been , and could in the future be , negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries in june [XXXX] , the u.s . federal government suspended the federal debt limit until [XXXX] . if congress does not raise the debt ceiling prior to [XXXX] , the u.s . could default on its obligations , including treasury securities that play an integral role in financial markets . a default by the u.s . could result in unprecedented market volatility and illiquidity , heightened operational risks relating to the clearance and settlement of transactions , margin and other disputes with clients and counterparties , an adverse impact to investors including money market funds that invest in u.s . treasuries , downgrades in the u.s . credit rating , further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and a recession in the u.s . or other economies . continued uncertainty relating to the debt ceiling could result in downgrades of the u.s . credit rating , which could adversely affect market conditions , lead to margin disputes , further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and necessitate significant operational changes among market participants , including us . a downgrade of the u.s . federal government ’s credit rating could also materially and adversely affect the market for repurchase agreements , securities borrowing and lending , and other financings typically collateralized by u.s . treasury or agency obligations . further , the fair value , liquidity and credit ratings of securities issued by , or other obligations of , agencies of the u.s . government or related to the u.s . government or its agencies , as well as municipal bonds could be similarly adversely affected . an increasing frequency of government shutdowns , or near shutdowns , in the u.s . could also lead to uncertainty as to the continued funding of the u.s . government , which could , in turn , adversely affect the credit ratings of the u.s . and the market for u.s . treasury or agency obligations . in [XXXX] , numerous elections will be held globally . as a result , there may be significant market uncertainty in the periods leading up to and/or following the elections and this could cause higher volatility , lower levels of market activity and other adverse conditions for our businesses . the outcomes of the elections could also result in changes in policy , which could also have adverse effects on us or the business environment in which we operate more generally . our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values , particularly where we have net “ long ” positions , receive fees based on the value of assets managed , or receive or post collateral . many of our businesses have net “ long ” positions in debt securities , loans , derivatives , mortgages , equities ( including private equity and real estate ) and most other asset classes . these include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients ’ activities , including our exchange - based market - making activities , or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products , as well as through our currencies , commodities , equities and mortgage - related activities . in addition , we invest in similar asset classes . substantially all of our investing and market - making positions and a portion of our loans are marked - to - market on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and promptly impact our earnings , unless we have effectively “ hedged ” our exposures to those declines . in certain circumstances ( particularly in the case of credit products , including leveraged loans , and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets ) , it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and , to the extent that we do so , the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets . sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated , and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate , the trading markets for certain assets , which may make it difficult to sell , hedge or value such assets . we may incur losses from time to time as trading markets deteriorate or cease to function , including with respect to loan commitments we have made or securities offerings we have underwritten . the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets has in the past negatively affected , and may in the future negatively affect , our capital , liquidity or leverage ratios , our funding costs and our ability to deploy capital . in our exchange - based market - making activities , we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market , including by purchasing securities in a declining market . in markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets , this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity . we receive asset - based management fees based on the value of our clients ’ portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and , in some cases , we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments . declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients ’ portfolios or fund assets , which in turn would typically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties . when the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline , the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or , if possible , reduce its trading position . an example of such a situation is a “ margin call ” in connection with a brokerage account . therefore , declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased . if we are the party providing collateral , this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral , this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties . in addition , volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets , which can lead to costly and time - consuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral , as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral . in cases where we foreclose on collateral , sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral have in the past resulted in , and may in the future result in , significant losses to us , especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation . in addition , we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents , was conducted in an improper manner , including in violation of law , or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business . our market - making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility . certain of our market - making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients , and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the results of these activities . increased volatility , while it can increase trading volumes and spreads , also increases risk as measured by value - at - risk ( var ) and increases risks in connection with our market - making activities and can cause us to reduce our inventory . limiting the size of our market - making positions can adversely affect our profitability . in periods when volatility is increasing , but asset values are declining significantly , it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts . in those circumstances , we have been and may in the future be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our var . in addition , increases in volatility increase the level of our rwas , which increases the amount of capital that we are required to hold , and this can reduce our profitability and reduce our ability to distribute capital to our shareholders . our investment banking , client intermediation , asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and ceos due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic , geopolitical or market conditions . our investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions . poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and ceo confidence , resulting in significant industry - wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of advisory transactions , which would likely have and have in the past had an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins . in particular , because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions , a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business . similarly , in recent years , cross - border initial public offerings and other securities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new issuance activity . legislative , regulatory or other changes that limit trading in , or the issuance of , securities outside the issuers ’ domestic markets , that result in or could result in the delisting or removal of securities from exchanges or indices , have in the past adversely affected and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting and client intermediation businesses . furthermore , changes , or proposed changes , to international trade and investment policies of the u.s . and other countries could negatively affect market activity levels and our revenues . in certain circumstances , market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility . market uncertainty , volatility and adverse economic conditions , as well as declines in asset values , may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues , principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses . even if clients do not withdraw their funds , they may invest them in products that generate less fee income . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees . poor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses , due to either general market conditions or underperformance ( relative to our competitors or to benchmarks ) by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell , affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients . this could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on aus or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products , such as structured notes or derivatives . to the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer , we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees . further , if , due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise , clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees ( e.g. , passively managed or fixed income products ) , our average effective management fee will decline further and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected . inflation has had , and could continue to have , a negative effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . inflationary pressures have affected economies , financial markets and market participants worldwide . inflationary pressures have increased certain of our operating expenses , and have adversely affected consumer sentiment and ceo confidence . central bank responses to inflationary pressures have also resulted in higher market interest rates , which , in turn , have contributed to lower activity levels across financial markets , in particular for debt underwriting transactions and mortgage originations , and resulted in lower values for certain financial assets which have adversely affected our equity and debt investments . higher interest rates increase our borrowing costs and have required us to increase interest paid on our deposits . if inflationary pressures persist , our expenses may increase further ; we may be unable to achieve our efficiency ratio target ; activity levels for certain of our businesses , in particular debt underwriting and mortgages , may decline ; our interest expense could increase faster than our interest income , reducing our net interest income and net interest margin ; certain of our investments could continue to incur losses or generally low levels of returns ; aus could decline , or the composition of our aus could shift to lower fee products , reducing management and other fees ; economies worldwide could experience recessions ; and we could continue to operate in a generally unfavorable economic and market environment . liquidity our liquidity , profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets . liquidity is essential to our businesses . it is of critical importance to us , as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity . our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets , an inability to raise or retain deposits , an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally , an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments , lack of timely settlement of transactions , unusual deposit outflows , or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral , such as in march [XXXX] , when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the covid-19 pandemic . this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control , such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us , or even by the perception among market participants that we , or other market participants , are experiencing greater liquidity risk . we employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks . the financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex , and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress . our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets , which could restrict liquidity for our positions . further , our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets , as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time , as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations . for example , in [XXXX] , an investment management firm with large positions with several financial institutions defaulted , resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those positions . in addition , clearinghouses , exchanges and other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise set - off rights or the right to require additional collateral , including in difficult market conditions , which could further impair our liquidity . numerous regulations have been adopted that impose more stringent liquidity requirements on large financial institutions , including us . these regulations require us to hold large amounts of highly liquid assets and reduce our flexibility to source and deploy funding . in addition , our need to manage our operations in light of certain regulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in gsib or other funding , which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets , including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit . widening credit spreads , as well as significant declines in the availability of credit , have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future . we fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long - term debt and commercial paper , by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries , by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities . we seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis . any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses . if our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost , these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding , both of which could reduce our profitability , particularly in our businesses that involve investing , lending and market making . our clients engaging in mergers , acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions . a lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size , volume and timing of our clients ’ merger and acquisition transactions , particularly large transactions , and adversely affect our advisory and underwriting businesses . our credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets . a lack of liquidity reduces price transparency , increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size , all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses . reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding . our credit ratings are important to our liquidity . a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts . under these provisions , counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral . termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements . as of december [XXXX] , our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of $ [XXX] million in the event of a one - notch downgrade of our credit ratings and $ [X.XX] billion in the event of a two - notch downgrade of our credit ratings . a downgrade by any one rating agency , depending on the agency ’s relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade , may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies . for further information about our credit ratings , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk management — liquidity risk management — credit ratings ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. our cost of obtaining long - term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads ( the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay ) . increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding . changes in credit spreads are continuous , market - driven , and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements . our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long - term debt . the market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries group inc . is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries , many of which are subject to legal , regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to group inc . group inc . is a holding company and , therefore , depends on dividends , distributions , loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations , including debt obligations . many of our subsidiaries , including our broker - dealer and bank subsidiaries , are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc . in addition , our broker - dealer and bank entities and their subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements , as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses . additional restrictions on related - party transactions , increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts , as well as lower earnings , can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of group inc . , including under the frb ’s source of strength requirement , and even require group inc . to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries . restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc . needs to make payments on its obligations , including debt obligations , or dividend payments . in addition , group inc . ’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary ’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary ’s creditors . there has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business . concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to “ ring fence ” or require internal total loss - absorbing capacity ( which may also be subject to “ bail - in ” powers , as described below ) at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities . the result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities , or to group inc . , including in times of stress , thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis . furthermore , group inc . has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries , including gs&co . and gs bank usa , subject to certain exceptions . in addition , group inc . guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction - by - transaction basis , as negotiated with counterparties . these guarantees may require group inc . to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when group inc . is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations . the requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators , and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators , may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long - term debt at group inc . or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities , and may reduce our ability to provide group inc . guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at group inc . resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient . furthermore , arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes . any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany dividends or payments . see “ business — regulation ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about

risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will not perform their obligations . these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . a failure of a significant market participant , or even concerns about a default by such an institution , has in the past and could in the future lead to significant liquidity problems , losses or defaults by other institutions , which in turn could adversely affect us . we are also exposed to the risk of a special assessment , including under the fdia or ola in the event of the failure of a bank or non - bank financial institution , which have in the past , and may in the future , adversely affect our results of operations . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances . in addition , deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold , including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements , could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes . a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results . while in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty , disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets . the termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights . default rates , downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress , increased volatility and illiquidity . as part of our clearing and prime financing activities , we finance our clients ’ positions , and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients . default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee . concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market - making , underwriting , investing and financing activities . concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market - making , underwriting , investing and financing activities . the number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period . moreover , because of concentrated risk , we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors . disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically . in addition , we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities . disruptions in the credit markets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated , and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate , the trading markets for loans we originate . these disruptions have in the past made , and may in the future make , it difficult for us to sell or value such assets , which have in the past resulted , and may in the future result , in losses for us . rules adopted under the dodd - frank act , and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions , require issuers of certain asset - backed securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset - backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset , which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities . our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling , syndicating or securitizing these positions , including during periods of market stress , has in the past negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions , including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers , as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans . in the ordinary course of business , we are at times subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty , borrower , issuer ( including sovereign issuers ) or geographic area or group of related countries , such as the e.u . , and a failure or downgrade of , or default by , such entity could negatively impact our businesses , perhaps materially , and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities , industries , countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated . regulatory reform , including the dodd - frank act , has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearinghouses , central agents or exchanges , which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities . while our activities expose us to many different industries , counterparties and countries , we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , clearinghouses , exchanges and investment funds . this has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries derivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk , unexpected risks and potential losses . we are party to a large number of derivative transactions , including credit derivatives . many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non - standardized , which can make exiting , transferring or settling positions difficult . many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security , loan or other obligation in order to receive payment . in a number of cases , we do not hold the underlying security , loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security , loan or other obligation . this could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk , as well as increased costs to us . derivative transactions also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed , that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty , or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be “ netted ” against other obligations with such counterparty . in addition , counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized . as a signatory to the isda universal protocol or u.s . isda protocol ( isda protocols ) and being subject to the frb ’s and fdic ’s rules on qfcs and similar rules in other jurisdictions , we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and , as this regime has not yet been tested , we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event . the isda protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts . derivative contracts and other transactions , including secondary bank loan purchases and sales , entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis . while the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement , we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights . in addition , as new complex derivative products are created , covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments , disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise , which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs . the provisions of the dodd - frank act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other otc derivatives , or a market shift toward standardized derivatives , could reduce the risk associated with these transactions , but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks , and could adversely affect our profitability . in addition , these provisions have increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms . operational a failure in our operational systems or human error , malfeasance or other misconduct , could impair our liquidity , disrupt our businesses , result in the disclosure of confidential information , damage our reputation and cause losses . our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a very large number of transactions , many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies , across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies . these transactions , as well as the information technology services we provide to clients , often must adhere to client - specific guidelines , as well as legal and regulatory standards . many rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators , exchanges and investors . compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging , and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely , accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules . as the volume , speed , frequency and complexity of transactions , especially electronic transactions ( as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real - time basis to clients , regulators and exchanges ) increase , developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure has become more challenging , and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions has increased , as have the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences . for example , the transition to a t+1 settlement timeframe in the u.s . in [XXXX] subjects us to increased operational risks with respect to reporting and timely settlement of transactions . these risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility . as with other similarly situated institutions , we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses , including our consumer - oriented activities . allegations or publicity , whether or not accurate , that our underwriting decisions do not treat consumers or clients fairly , or comply with the applicable law or regulation , have in the past resulted and may in the future result in negative publicity , reputational damage and governmental and regulatory scrutiny , investigations and enforcement actions . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our financial , accounting , data processing or other operational systems and facilities have in the past not operated properly in certain respects and may in the future not operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , such as a spike in transaction volume , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . we must continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets , and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or , due to errors in processing such transactions , adversely affect markets , our clients and counterparties or us . enhancements and updates to systems , as well as the requisite training , including in connection with the integration of new businesses , entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones . the use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses and those of our clients and our third - party service providers and vendors . their importance has continued to increase , in particular in light of hybrid work arrangements . computers and computer networks are subject to various risks , including , among others , cyber attacks , inherent technological defects , system failures and human error . for example , fundamental security flaws in computer chips found in many types of these computing devices and phones have been reported in the past and may occur in the future . the use of personal devices by our employees or by our vendors for work - related activities also presents risks related to potential violations of record retention and other requirements . cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing . service disruptions have resulted , and may result in the future , in delays in accessing , or the loss of , data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients ’ access to our platforms . there have been a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud computing providers . addressing these and similar issues could be costly and affect the performance of these businesses and systems . operational risks may be incurred in applying fixes and there may still be residual security risks . notwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology - based risk and control systems , our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource , and , from time to time , they have in the past and may in the future make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies , laws , rules or procedures that are not always caught immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures , which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations . these have in the past and may in the future include calculation errors , mistakes in addressing emails , errors in software or model development or implementation , or simple errors in judgment , as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies , laws , rules or procedures . human errors , malfeasance and other misconduct , including the intentional misuse of client information in connection with insider trading or for other purposes , even if promptly discovered and remediated , has in the past resulted and may in the future result in reputational damage and losses and liabilities for us . the majority of the employees in our primary locations , including the new york metropolitan area , london , bengaluru , hyderabad , hong kong , tokyo , salt lake city and dallas , work in close proximity to one another . our headquarters is located in the new york metropolitan area , and we have our largest employee concentration occupying two principal office buildings near the hudson river waterfront . they are subject to potential catastrophic events , including , but not limited to , terrorist attacks , extreme weather , or other hostile events that could negatively affect our business . notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity , business disruptions impacting our offices and employees could lead to our employees ’ inability to occupy the offices , communicate with or travel to other office locations or work remotely . as a result , our ability to service and interact with clients may be adversely impacted , due to our failure or inability to successfully implement business contingency plans . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries a failure or disruption in our infrastructure , or in the operational systems or infrastructure of third parties , could impair our liquidity , disrupt our businesses , damage our reputation and cause losses . we face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions , and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows , we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients ’ systems . there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents , exchanges and clearinghouses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges , which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay , termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost - effective alternatives in the event of any such failure , delay , termination or constraint . industry consolidation , whether among market participants or financial intermediaries , increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated , often on an accelerated basis . the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents , exchanges and clearinghouses , and the increased centrality of these entities , increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry - wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business . interconnectivity of financial institutions with other companies through , among other things , application programming interfaces or apis presents similar risks . any such failure , termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions , service our clients , manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our clients , impairment of our liquidity , disruption of our businesses , regulatory intervention or reputational damage . despite our resiliency plans and facilities , our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located . this may include a disruption involving electrical , satellite , undersea cable or other communications , internet , transportation or other facilities used by us , our employees or third parties with which we conduct business , including cloud service providers . these disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of third parties , or as a result of events with a broader impact globally , regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located , including , but not limited to , natural disasters , war , civil unrest , terrorism , economic or political developments , pandemics and weather events . in addition , although we seek to diversify our third - party vendors to increase our resiliency , we are exposed to risks if our vendors operate in the same area and are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us . we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors ’ use of common service providers . additionally , although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology , cryptocurrency and similar technologies is growing , the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses . we are exposed to risks , and may become exposed to additional risks , related to distributed ledger technology , including through our facilitation of clients ’ activities involving financial products that use distributed ledger technology , such as blockchain , cryptocurrencies or other digital assets , our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology , the use of distributed ledger technology by third - party vendors , clients , counterparties , clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries , and the receipt of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as collateral . market volatility of financial products using distributed ledger technology may increase these risks . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the development and use of artificial intelligence ( ai ) present risks and challenges that may adversely impact our business . we or our third - party vendors , clients or counterparties may develop or incorporate ai technology in certain business processes , services or products . the development and use of ai present a number of risks and challenges to our business . the legal and regulatory environment relating to ai is uncertain and rapidly evolving , both in the u.s . and internationally , and includes regulation targeted specifically at ai as well as provisions in intellectual property , privacy , consumer protection , employment and other laws applicable to the use of ai . these evolving laws and regulations could require changes in our implementation of ai technology and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non - compliance . ai models , particularly generative ai models , may produce output or take action that is incorrect , that result in the release of private , confidential or proprietary information , that reflect biases included in the data on which they are trained , infringe on the intellectual property rights of others , or that is otherwise harmful . in addition , the complexity of many ai models makes it challenging to understand why they are generating particular outputs . this limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of ai models , understanding and monitoring the capabilities of the ai models , reducing erroneous output , eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made . further , we may rely on ai models developed by third parties , and , to that extent , would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train their models , including risks arising from the inclusion of any unauthorized material in the training data for their models , and the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated with the output of their models , matters over which we may have limited visibility . any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures . in addition to our use of ai technologies , we are exposed to risks arising from the use of ai technologies by bad actors to commit fraud and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks . generative ai , if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks , could result in losses , liquidity outflows or other adverse effects at a particular financial institution or exchange . a failure to protect our computer systems , networks and information , and our clients ’ information , against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses , result in the disclosure , theft or destruction of confidential information , damage our reputation and cause losses . our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors . there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies , consumer - based companies , software and information technology service providers , governmental agencies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized access or disclosure of client , customer or other confidential information in recent years , as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination , theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets , as a result of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties , including actions by foreign governments . there have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ ransom ” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems . we are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks , including denial - of - service attacks , and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data . we have faced a high volume of cyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internet - based products and services , as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies , and as we provide these services to individual consumers . further , the use of ai by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third - party vendors and clients . the migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee - owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks , as do hybrid work arrangements . in addition , due to our interconnectivity with third - party vendors ( and their respective service providers ) , central agents , exchanges , clearinghouses and other financial institutions , we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event . these impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event or could result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client , customer or other confidential information , which could , in turn , interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information , we may not be able to anticipate , detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats , including because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated , change frequently and are often not recognized until launched . cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources , including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations . third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees , clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients , and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent . although we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access , misuse , computer viruses or other malicious code , cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact . risks relating to cyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the greater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers . due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems , the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues . in addition , protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into , and adversely affect our ability to respond to , cyber threats and issues with our systems . if one or more of these types of events occur , it potentially could jeopardize our , our clients ’ , our counterparties ’ or third parties ’ confidential and other information processed , stored in , or transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or those of our clients , counterparties or third parties , which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action , significant losses or reputational damage . in addition , such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being properly detected or escalated , and , following detection or escalation , it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent , amount and type of information compromised . during the course of an investigation , we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it , and actions , decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business , results of operations and reputation . moreover , new regulations require us to disclose information on a timely basis about material cybersecurity incidents , including those that may not have been resolved or fully investigated at the time of disclosure . we have expended , and expect to continue to expend , significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures , but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action , as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us . regulatory agencies have become increasingly focused on cybersecurity incidents . our clients ’ confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients ’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company . losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business , financial condition and results of operations . the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies heightens these and other operational risks , as do hybrid work arrangements . certain aspects of the security of these technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control , and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation , corruption or loss of confidential and other information . in addition , there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures , despite their sophistication , may be defeated , particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available . we routinely transmit and receive personal , confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means . we have discussed and worked with clients , vendors , service providers , counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks , but we do not have , and may be unable to put in place , secure capabilities with all of our clients , vendors , service providers , counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information . an interception , misuse or mishandling of personal , confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client , vendor , service provider , counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability , regulatory action and reputational harm . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies . we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial , credit , operational , compliance and legal reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms . our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from market - making , investing or lending positions , and underwriting activities , with our exposure to potential losses . while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . thus , in the course of our activities , we have incurred and may in the future incur losses . market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk . the models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators . in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances , previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated , or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions . these types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses , and they may do so in the future . these changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours . in these and other cases , it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations , including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets . in addition , the use of models in connection with risk management and numerous other critical activities presents risks that the models may be ineffective , either because of poor design , ineffective testing , or improper or flawed inputs , as well as unpermitted access to the models resulting in unapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs . to the extent that we have positions through our market - making or origination activities or we make investments directly through our investing activities , including private equity , that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging , we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with those positions . in addition , to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation , we invest our own capital in private equity , credit , real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds , whether for legal , reputational or other reasons , may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments . prudent risk management , as well as regulatory restrictions , may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties , geographic areas or markets , which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities . our consumer offerings present us with different risks , and we have needed and continue to need to expand and adapt our risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities . a failure to adequately assess and control such risk exposures could result in losses to us . for further information about our risk management policies and procedures , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of

enforcement , regulatory and taxing authorities , as well as private litigation , in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses . in many cases , our activities have been and may continue to be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions . among other things , as a result of law enforcement authorities , regulators or private parties challenging our compliance with existing laws and regulations , we or our employees have been , and could be , fined , criminally charged or sanctioned ; prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities ; subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities , including higher capital requirements ; or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect to our employees . these limitations or conditions may limit our business activities and negatively impact our profitability . in addition to the impact on the scope and profitability of our business activities , day - to - day compliance with existing laws and regulations has involved and will continue to involve significant amounts of time , including that of our senior leaders and that of a large number of dedicated compliance and other reporting and operational personnel , in connection with which we expect to continue to add personnel , all of which may negatively impact our profitability . our revenues and profitability and those of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital , leverage , liquidity and long - term funding levels , requirements related to resolution and recovery planning , derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight , as well as limitations on which and , if permitted , how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions . the laws , regulations and accounting standards , that apply to our businesses are often complex and , in many cases , we must make interpretive decisions regarding the application of those laws , regulations and accounting standards to our business activities . changes in interpretations , whether in response to regulatory guidance , industry conventions , our own reassessments or otherwise , could adversely affect our businesses , results of operations or ability to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements , such as capital or liquidity requirements . if there are new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients , including capital , liquidity , leverage , long - term debt , total loss - absorbing capacity and margin requirements , restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices , reporting requirements , requirements relating to recovery and resolution planning , tax burdens and compensation restrictions , that are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions ( whether based on size , method of funding , activities , geography or other criteria ) , compliance with these new laws or regulations , or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations , could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way . in addition , regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally , such as taxes on stock transfers , share repurchases and other financial transactions , could adversely impact levels of market activity more broadly , and thus impact our businesses . changes to laws or regulations , such as tax laws , could also have a disproportionate impact on us , based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to financial services and financial firms or due to our corporate structure or where or how we provide these services . these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions , or even make it uneconomic for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in those jurisdictions , or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices , restructuring our businesses , moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other locations or complying with applicable capital requirements , including reducing dividends or share repurchases , liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and

aspects of the dodd - frank act that have affected or may in the future affect our businesses are : increased capital , liquidity and reporting requirements ; limitations on activities in which we may engage ; increased regulation of and restrictions on otc derivatives markets and transactions ; limitations on incentive compensation ; limitations on affiliate transactions ; requirements to reorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and resolution planning ; increased deposit insurance assessments ; and increased standards of care for broker - dealers and investment advisers in dealing with clients . the implementation of higher capital requirements , more stringent requirements relating to liquidity , long - term debt and total loss - absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of , or investment in , covered funds by the volcker rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position , particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions . the july [XXXX] proposal from the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies to implement the basel committee ’s finalization of the post - crisis regulatory capital reforms would raise our capital requirements , if adopted as proposed . we may also become subject to higher and more stringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result of the implementation of future basel committee standards . see "" business — regulation — banking supervision and regulation — risk - based capital ratios ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about proposed regulatory requirements . as described in “ business — regulation — banking supervision and regulation — risk - based capital ratios ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k , the scb has replaced the capital conservation buffer under the standardized capital rules and resulted in higher standardized capital ratio requirements . failure to comply with these requirements could limit our ability to , among other things , repurchase shares , pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments . in addition , if we are required to resubmit our capital plan , we generally may not make capital distributions , such as share repurchases or dividends , without the prior approval of the frb . dividends and repurchases are also subject to oversight by the frb , which can result in limitations . limitations on our ability to make capital distributions could , among other things , prevent us from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our return on equity . additionally , as a g‑sib , we are subject to the g‑sib surcharge . our g‑sib surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year . expansion of our businesses , growth in our balance sheet and increased reliance on short - term wholesale funding have resulted in increases and in the future may result in further increases in our g‑sib surcharge and a corresponding increase in our capital requirements . the july [XXXX] proposal from the frb would introduce additional granularity in the surcharge buckets and increase the amount of financial data used in the calculation of the g - sib surcharge based on averages over the year , as opposed to period - end values , which could increase our g - sib surcharge . we are also subject to laws and regulations , such as the gdpr and the california consumer privacy act , relating to the privacy of the information of clients , employees or others , and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage . as new privacy - related laws and regulations are implemented , the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations , as well as our potential liability for non - compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches , may significantly increase . in addition , our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance , encryption and data on - shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate . compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies , procedures and technology for information security , which could , among other things , make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation , corruption or loss of information or technology . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our consumer - oriented deposit - taking and credit card businesses subject us to numerous additional regulations in the jurisdictions in which these businesses operate . not only are these regulations extensive , but they involve types of regulations and supervision , as well as regulatory compliance risks , that have not historically applied to us . the level of regulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting financial interactions with consumers is often much greater than that associated with doing business with institutions and high - net - worth individuals . complying with these regulations is time - consuming , costly and presents new and increased risks . our expansion into consumer - oriented activities resulted in a change to gs bank usa ’s cra requirements in [XXXX] , such that gs bank usa is no longer assessed as a “ wholesale bank ” for cra compliance purposes and , instead , is assessed pursuant to a strategic plan . any failure to comply with different or expanded cra requirements as a result of this change in assessment methods could negatively impact gs bank usa ’s cra ratings , cause reputational harm and result in limits on our ability to make future acquisitions or engage in certain new activities . increasingly , regulators and courts have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where they have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing , even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client . regulators and courts have also increasingly found liability as a “ control person ” for activities of entities in which financial institutions or funds controlled by financial institutions have an investment , but which they do not actively manage . in addition , regulators and courts continue to seek to establish “ fiduciary ” obligations to counterparties to which no such duty had been thought to exist . to the extent that such efforts are successful , the cost of , and liabilities associated with , engaging in brokerage , clearing , market - making , prime financing , investing and other similar activities could increase significantly . to the extent that we have fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for individual , institutional , sovereign or investment fund clients , any breach , or even an alleged breach , of such obligations could have materially negative legal , regulatory and reputational consequences . for information about the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject , see “ business — regulation ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. a failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses . due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base , we regularly address potential conflicts of interest , including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict , or are perceived to conflict , with the interests of that client or another client , as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non - public information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship . in addition , our status as a bhc subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the frb with respect to transactions between gs bank usa and its subsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and , under the volcker rule , transactions between us and covered funds . we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest , including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses . however , appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult , and our reputation , which is one of our most important assets , could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if we fail , or appear to fail , to identify , disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest . in addition , potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions . additionally , our one goldman sachs initiative , as well as the alignment of our businesses , aim to increase collaboration among our businesses , which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity . governmental scrutiny from regulators , legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to compensation , our business practices , our past actions and other matters remains at high levels . political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past resulted and may in the future result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage , as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government officials . press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing ( including , in some cases , press coverage and public statements that do not directly involve us ) often result in some type of investigation by regulators , legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits . responding to these investigations and lawsuits , regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding , is time - consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business . penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to support legislation targeted at the financial services industry . governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal or other actions , including seeking admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas , in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a company is viewed as having previously engaged in criminal , regulatory or other misconduct . adverse publicity , governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees , which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations . further , we are subject to regulatory settlements , orders and feedback that require significant remediation activities and enhancements to existing controls , systems and procedures , which has required and will require us to commit significant resources , including hiring , as well as testing the operation and effectiveness of new controls , policies and procedures . the failure to complete these remediation activities in a timely manner could lead to higher operating expenses , reputational damage and other negative consequences . the financial services industry generally and our businesses in particular have been subject to negative publicity . our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel , whether or not accurate or true , that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations . postings on these types of forums may also adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other parties that owe us money , securities or other assets and increase the chance that they will not perform their obligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their use of our services . the speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels , in particular social media , may magnify risks relating to negative publicity . the rapid dissemination of negative information through social media , in part , is believed to have led to the collapse of silicon valley bank ( svb ) . svb suffered a level of deposit withdrawals within a time period not previously experienced by a financial institution . we could also be subject to rapid deposit withdrawals or other outflows as a result of negative social media posts or other negative publicity . substantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects . we face significant legal risks in our businesses , and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high . see notes [XX] and [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for information about certain of our legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations . we have seen legal claims by consumers and clients increase in a market downturn and employment - related claims increase following periods in which we have reduced our headcount . additionally , governmental entities have been plaintiffs and are parties in certain of our legal proceedings , and we may face future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or other governmental entities , as well as follow - on civil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlements . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries significant settlements by large financial institutions , including , in some cases , us , with governmental entities have become common . the trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions , including , in some cases , us , in similar actions , especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements . the uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses , which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties . claims of collusion or anti - competitive conduct have become more common . financial institutions ( including us ) have been subject to civil cases and investigatory demands relating to alleged bid - rigging , group boycotts or other anti - competitive practices . antitrust laws generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damages . these claims have resulted in significant settlements and fines in the past and may do so in the future . we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide , including the fcpa and the u.k . bribery act , relating to corrupt and illegal payments to , and hiring practices with regard to , government officials and others . violation of these or similar laws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalties . such violations could also result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation . certain law enforcement authorities have recently required admissions of wrongdoing , and , in some cases , criminal pleas , as part of the resolutions of matters brought against financial institutions or their employees . see for example , “ 1mdb - related matters ” in note [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation , could adversely affect our reputation , could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects . further , as a result of this type of settlement , we are no longer a “ well - known seasoned issuer , ” which places limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities . in conducting our businesses around the world , we are subject to political , legal , regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries . in conducting our businesses and supporting our global operations , we are subject to risks of possible nationalization , expropriation , price controls , capital controls , exchange controls , communications and other content restrictions , and other restrictive governmental actions . for example , sanctions have been imposed by the u.s . and the e.u . on certain individuals and companies in russia and venezuela . in many countries , the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the transactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving , and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market . we have been in some cases subject to divergent and conflicting laws and regulations across markets , and we are increasingly subject to the risk that the jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or may implement laws and regulations that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction . any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market , but also on our reputation generally . further , in some jurisdictions a failure , or alleged failure , to comply with laws and regulations has subjected and may in the future subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions , but also criminal actions and other sanctions . we are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases . while business and other practices throughout the world differ , our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments , hiring practices and money laundering , as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals , groups and countries , such as the fcpa , the bsa and the u.k . bribery act . while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring , the geographical diversity of our operations , employees , clients and consumers , as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with , greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation . see for example , “ 1mdb - related matters ” in note [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries in addition , there have been a number of highly publicized cases around the world , involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry , and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct . this misconduct has included and may also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies , rules or procedures or misappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary information , including proprietary software . it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all cases , as reflected by the settlements relating to 1mdb . the application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the u.s . and in non - u.s . jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for group inc . ’s security holders . as described in “ business — regulation — banking supervision and regulation — insolvency of an idi or a bhc , ” if the fdic is appointed as receiver under ola , the rights of group inc . ’s creditors would be determined under ola , and substantial differences exist in the rights of creditors between ola and the u.s . bankruptcy code , including the right of the fdic under ola to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances , which could have a material adverse effect on our debtholders . the fdic has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under ola to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that would , among other things , impose losses on shareholders , debtholders and other creditors of the top - tier bhc ( in our case , group inc . ) , while the bhc ’s subsidiaries may continue to operate . it is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under ola , in which group inc . would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings ( and its material broker - dealer , bank and other operating entities would not enter resolution proceedings ) , would result in greater losses to group inc . ’s security holders ( including holders of our fixed rate , floating rate and indexed debt securities ) , than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy , such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for group inc . and certain of its material subsidiaries . assuming group inc . entered resolution proceedings and support from group inc . or other resources available to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent , losses at the subsidiary level would be transferred to group inc . and ultimately borne by group inc . ’s security holders , third - party creditors of group inc . ’s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims , and group inc . ’s security holders ( including our shareholders , debtholders and other unsecured creditors ) could face significant and possibly complete losses . in that case , group inc . ’s security holders would face losses while the third - party creditors of group inc . ’s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings . in addition , holders of group inc . ’s eligible long - term debt and holders of group inc . ’s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under ola if the fdic exercised its right , described above , to disregard the priority of creditor claims . ola also provides the fdic with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses , and amounts owed to the u.s . government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors , including senior creditors . in addition , under ola , claims of creditors ( including debtholders ) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which group inc . ’s assets are transferred . if such a securities - for - claims exchange were implemented , there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged . while the fdic has issued regulations to implement ola , not all aspects of how the fdic might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries in addition , certain jurisdictions , including the u.k . and the e.u . , have implemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity . such “ bail - in ” powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders . for example , the bank of england requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material u.k . subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the bank of england to exercise such “ bail - in ” powers in certain circumstances . if the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is “ bailed in , ” group inc . ’s claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries ’ third - party creditors or written down . u.s . regulators are considering and non - u.s . authorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss - absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the top - tier bhc and , ultimately , to security holders of the top - tier bhc in the event of failure . the application of group inc . ’s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for group inc . ’s security holders . in our resolution plan , group inc . would be resolved under the u.s . bankruptcy code . the strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy : group inc . and goldman sachs funding llc ( funding ihc ) , a wholly - owned , direct subsidiary of group inc . , would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries , including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness , the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans . if this strategy were successful , creditors of some or all of group inc . ’s major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims , while group inc . ’s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses . to facilitate the execution of our resolution plan , we formed funding ihc . in exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest , group inc . transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its gcla to funding ihc , and agreed to transfer additional gcla above prescribed thresholds . we also put in place a capital and liquidity support agreement ( clsa ) among group inc . , funding ihc and our major subsidiaries . under the clsa , funding ihc has provided group inc . with a committed line of credit that allows group inc . to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business . in addition , if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent , ( i ) the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven , ( ii ) all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to group inc . will be transferred to funding ihc or their maturities will be extended to five years , ( iii ) group inc . will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and gcla ( other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses ) to funding ihc , and ( iv ) funding ihc will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries . group inc . ’s and funding ihc ’s obligations under the clsa are secured pursuant to a related security agreement . such actions would materially and adversely affect group inc . ’s liquidity . as a result , during a period of severe stress , group inc . might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the clsa and related security agreement had not been implemented . if group inc . ’s proposed resolution strategy were successful , group inc . ’s security holders could face losses while the third - party creditors of group inc . ’s major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings . as part of the strategy , group inc . could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries ’ derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross - default and early termination rights would be stayed under the isda protocols , as applicable , which would result in holders of group inc . ’s eligible long - term debt and holders of group inc . ’s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations . it is also possible that holders of group inc . ’s eligible long - term debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of group inc . ’s major subsidiaries . if group inc . ’s proposed resolution strategy were not successful , group inc . ’s financial condition would be adversely impacted and group inc . ’s security holders , including debtholders , may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented . in all cases , any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman

or other costs and face limitations on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient . our commodities activities , particularly our physical commodities activities , subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks , including environmental , reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs . as part of our commodities business , we purchase and sell certain physical commodities , arrange for their storage and transport , and engage in market making of commodities . the commodities involved in these activities may include crude oil , refined oil products , natural gas , liquefied natural gas , electric power , agricultural products , metals ( base and precious ) , minerals ( including unenriched uranium ) , emission credits , coal , freight and related products and indices . we make investments in and finance entities that engage in the production , storage and transportation of numerous commodities , including many of the commodities referenced above . these activities subject us and/or the entities in which we invest to extensive and evolving federal , state and local energy , environmental , antitrust and other governmental laws and regulations worldwide , including environmental laws and regulations relating to , among others , air quality , water quality , waste management , transportation of hazardous substances , natural resources , site remediation and health and safety . additionally , rising climate change concerns have led to additional regulation , regulatory scrutiny and disclosure obligations that have increased and could further increase the operating costs and could adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments and activities . there may be substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commodities - related activities and investments . compliance with these laws and regulations requires significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring , renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels , payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes , and application for , and holding of , permits and licenses . commodities involved in our intermediation activities and investments are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events , which are likely to be outside of our control , including those arising from the breakdown or failure of transport vessels , storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions , fires , leaks , spills or release of hazardous substances , performance below expected levels of output or efficiency , terrorist attacks , extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events . in addition , we rely on third - party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part , including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store commodities , could expose us to costs or losses . also , while we seek to insure against potential risks , we do not have insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses . the occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients , may impair our operations or financial results and may result in litigation , regulatory action , negative publicity or other reputational harm . we have made changes to and may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons or due to the transition to a less carbon - dependent economy in response to climate change . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries competition our results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base . our client base is not the same as that of our major competitors . our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors . therefore , unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets . for example , our market - making businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than some of our competitors and such clients have in the past been and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility . correspondingly , favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market . for example , we have a smaller corporate client base in our market - making businesses than some of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients . similarly , we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions , which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution . the financial services industry is highly competitive . the financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive , and we expect them to remain so . we compete on the basis of a number of factors , including transaction execution , our products and services , innovation , reputation , creditworthiness and price . there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry . this has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets . as a result , we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions . as we have expanded into new business areas and new geographic regions , we have faced competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients , regulators and industry participants in the relevant market , which could adversely affect our ability to expand our businesses . governments and regulators have adopted regulations , imposed taxes , adopted compensation restrictions or otherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost - effective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions , including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage . these or other similar rules , many of which do not apply to all our u.s . or non - u.s . competitors , could impact our ability to compete effectively . pricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase , particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices . for example , in connection with investment banking and other assignments , in response to competitive pressure we have experienced , we have extended and priced credit at levels that in some cases have not fully compensated us for the risks we undertook . the financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry . many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions , and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions . this has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices , including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated . while we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and prevent such activities , they may not be effective . allegations of such activities , particularly by regulators , can have a negative reputational impact and can subject us to large fines and settlements , and potentially significant penalties , including treble damages . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies , including trading and distributed ledger technologies , including cryptocurrencies , has increased competition . technology is fundamental to our business and our industry . the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges . securities , futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically , both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems , and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue . some of these alternative trading systems compete with us , particularly our exchange - based market - making activities , and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas . in addition , the increased use by our clients of low - cost electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets has caused and could continue to cause a reduction in commissions and spreads . as our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets , we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure . we have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so , but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return , particularly given the generally lower commissions arising from electronic trades . in addition , the emergence , adoption and evolution of new technologies , including distributed ledgers , such as digital assets and blockchain , and ai , have required us to invest resources to adapt our existing products and services , and we expect to continue to make such investments , which could be material . the adoption and evolution of such new technologies may also increase our compliance and regulatory costs . further , technologies , such as those based on distributed ledgers , that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payments processing and other financial services . regulatory limitations on our involvement in products and platforms involving digital assets and distributed ledger technologies may not apply equally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors . we may not be as timely or successful in developing or integrating , or even able to develop or integrate , new products and technologies , such as those built on distributed ledgers or ai technologies , into our existing products and services , adapting to changes in client preferences or achieving market acceptance of our products and services , any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain clients , cause us to lose market share or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us . our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees . our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people ; therefore , our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses , to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees . factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits , and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring , training and promoting qualified employees . as a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of year - end discretionary compensation , a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity - related awards , declines in our profitability , or in the outlook for our future profitability , as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms , can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees . competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry , including the technology industry , for qualified employees has often been intense . we have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of our consumer - oriented businesses and our technology initiatives . this is also the case in emerging and growth markets , where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region . laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees ’ income or the amount or composition of compensation , or that require us to disclose our or our competitors ’ compensation practices , may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions . as described further in “ business — regulation — compensation practices ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k , our compensation practices are subject to review by , and the standards of , the frb . as a large global financial and banking institution , we are subject to limitations on compensation practices ( which may or may not affect the companies with which we compete for talent ) by the frb , the pra , the fca , the fdic and other regulators worldwide . these limitations have shaped our compensation practices , which has , in some cases , adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employees , in particular in relation to companies not subject to these limitations , and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend , in part , on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employees located in strategic locations . our future human capital resource requirements and the benefits provided by strategic locations are uncertain , and we may not realize the benefits we anticipate . market developments and general business environment our businesses , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by unforeseen or catastrophic events , including pandemics , terrorist attacks , wars , extreme weather events or other natural disasters . the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events , including pandemics or other widespread health emergencies ( or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency ) , terrorist attacks , wars , extreme weather events , solar events or other natural disasters , could adversely affect our business , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations . these events could have such effects through economic or financial market disruptions or challenging economic or market conditions more generally , the deterioration of our creditworthiness or that of our counterparties , changes in consumer sentiment and consumer borrowing , spending and savings patterns , liquidity stress , or operational difficulties ( such as travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in our offices ) that impair our ability to manage our businesses . climate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties , and our actual or perceived action or inaction relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation . climate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary locations , which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients , adversely affect the value of our investments , including our real estate investments , and reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance . climate change and the transition to a less carbon - dependent economy may also have a negative impact on the operations or financial condition of our clients and counterparties , which may decrease revenues from those clients and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients and counterparties . in addition , climate change may impact the broader economy . we are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in public policy , laws and regulations , or market and public perceptions and preferences in connection with the transition to a less carbon - dependent economy . these changes could adversely affect our business , results of operations and reputation . for example , our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our or our clients ’ involvement in , or decision not to participate in , certain industries or projects perceived to be associated with causing or exacerbating climate change , as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change . if we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective , insufficient or otherwise inappropriate , our business , reputation and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer . new regulations or guidance relating to climate change , as well as the perspectives of government officials , regulators , shareholders , employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change , may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products . federal and state , and non - u.s . banking regulators and supervisory authorities , shareholders and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address risks related to climate change , both directly and with respect to their clients , which may result in financial institutions coming under increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending , investment and advisory activities . for example , in [XXXX] we participated in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise conducted by the frb . we are also subject to interagency guidance jointly issued by the frb , fdic , and occ in october [XXXX] regarding principles for climate - related financial risk management for large financial institutions . in addition , in december [XXXX] , the nydfs issued proposed guidance on the management of material financial risks from climate change , which would apply to new york state - regulated banking and mortgage institutions , including gs bank usa . in the e.u . , the csrd will become effective beginning with year - end [XXXX] reporting . the csrd expands the scope of esg disclosure required under e.u . rules . these regulations , guidance and expectations , as well as any additional or heightened requirements , could result in increased regulatory , compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements . the risks associated with , and the perspective of regulators , shareholders , employees and other stakeholders regarding , climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly , which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate change - related risks and uncertainties , but we expect that climate change - related risks will increase over time . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our business , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations have been adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by conflicts , and related sanctions and other developments . the conflict between russia and ukraine has negatively affected the global economy . governments around the world have responded to russia ’s invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on certain industry sectors , including price caps on russian oil , and on russian businesses and persons . compliance with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has increased our costs and otherwise adversely affected our business and may continue to do so . russia has responded with its own restrictions against investors and countries outside russia and has proposed additional measures aimed at non - russian owned businesses . businesses in the u.s . and globally have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation , energy , and raw materials due in part to the negative effects of the conflict on the global economy . the conflicts in the middle east could also affect and harm our business and increase market uncertainty . the impact of these conflicts on our business and operations is uncertain and therefore can not be predicted . the escalation or continuation of these conflicts or other hostilities could result in , among other things , an increased risk of cyber attacks , an increased frequency and volume of failures to settle securities transactions , supply chain disruptions , higher inflation , lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity , currency and other financial markets . the extent and duration of the conflicts , sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict , and the consequences for our business could be significant . if international political instability and geopolitical tensions continue or increase in any region in which we do business , our business and results of operations could be harmed . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk management — credit risk management — selected exposures — country exposures ” for further information about our credit exposure to russia and ukraine . certain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in reference rates , currencies , indexes , baskets or etfs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked . many of the products that we own or that we offer , such as structured notes , warrants , swaps or security - based swaps , pay interest or determine the principal amount to be paid at maturity or in the event of default by reference to rates or by reference to an index , currency , basket , etf or other financial metric ( the underlier ) . in the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed , by reference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise , the underlier ceases to exist ( for example , in the event that a country withdraws from the euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark , an index or etf sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or etf , or stocks in a basket are delisted or become impermissible to be included in the index or etf ) , the underlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark or there are legal or regulatory constraints on linking a financial instrument to the underlier , we may experience adverse effects . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our business , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating tensions between the u.s . and china . continued or escalating tensions between the u.s . and china have resulted in and may result in additional changes to u.s . international trade and investment policies , which could disrupt international trade and investment , adversely affect financial markets , including market activity levels , and adversely impact our revenues . continued or escalating tensions may also lead to the u.s . , china or other countries taking other actions , which could include the implementation of sanctions , tariffs or foreign exchange measures , the large - scale sale of u.s . treasury securities or restrictions on cross - border trade , investment or transfer of information or technology . any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients ’ businesses , as well as our financial condition , liquidity and results of operations , possibly materially . a conflict , or concerns about a potential conflict , involving china and taiwan , the u.s . or other countries could negatively impact financial markets and our or our clients ’ businesses . trade restrictions by the u.s . or other countries in response to a conflict or potential conflict involving china , including financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain organizations or individuals , or actions taken by china in response to trade restrictions , could negatively impact our or our clients ’ ability to conduct business in certain countries or with certain counterparties and could negatively impact regional and global financial markets and economic conditions . any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations , possibly materially . we face enhanced risks as we operate in new locations and transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties . our businesses , have in the past , and may in the future , bring us into contact , directly or indirectly , with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base , expose us to new asset classes and new markets , and present us with integration challenges . for example , we continue to transact business and invest in new regions , including a wide range of emerging and growth markets , and we expect this trend to continue . various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions , including significant devaluations of their currencies , defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt , capital and currency exchange controls , and low or negative growth rates in their economies . the possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally . furthermore , in a number of our businesses , including where we make markets , invest and lend , we own interests in , or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of , public services , such as airports , toll roads and shipping ports , as well as physical commodities and commodities infrastructure components , both within and outside the u.s . in our consumer - oriented activities , we have faced and continue to face , additional compliance , legal and regulatory risk , increased reputational risk and increased operational risk due to , among other things , higher transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer and client information . we are also subject to additional legal requirements , including with respect to suitability and consumer protection ( for example , regulation best interest , fair lending laws and regulations and privacy laws and regulations ) . further , identity fraud may increase and credit reporting practices may change in a manner that makes it more difficult for financial institutions , such as us , to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers . we have increased and intend to further increase our transaction banking activities . as a result , we face additional compliance , legal and regulatory risk , including with respect to know - your - customer , anti - money laundering and reporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers of property belonging to countries , entities and individuals subject to sanctions by u.s . or other governmental authorities . we are making significant enhancements to existing controls , systems and procedures to manage these risks . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries new business initiatives expose us to new and enhanced risks , including risks associated with dealing with governmental entities , reputational concerns arising from dealing with different types of clients , business partners , counterparties and investors , greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities , increased credit - related , market , sovereign and operational risks , risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism , and reputational concerns with the manner in which certain assets are being operated or held or in which we interact with these clients , business partners , counterparties and investors . legal , regulatory and reputational risks may also exist in connection with activities and transactions involving new products or markets where there is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or conflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction involved , particularly where transactions in such products may involve multiple jurisdictions . we have developed and pursued new business and strategic initiatives , including acquisitions , and may continue to do so . if and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiatives , we may incur unanticipated costs and losses , and face other adverse consequences , such as negative reputational effects . in addition , the actual effects of pursuing those initiatives may differ , possibly materially , from the benefits that we expect to realize from them , such as generating additional revenues , achieving expense savings , reducing operational risk exposures or using capital and funding more efficiently . engaging in new activities exposes us to a variety of risks , including that we may be unable to successfully develop new , competitive , efficient and effective systems and processes , and hire and retain the necessary personnel . due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured consumer lending , our loan loss assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business or in expanding the product offerings for the business . in recent years , we have invested , and may continue to invest , more in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues . such investments and acquisitions may not be successful or have returns similar to our other businesses . we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from acquisitions or other business initiatives in the time frames we expect , or at all . we have engaged in selective acquisitions and may continue to do so in the future and these acquisitions may , individually or in the aggregate , be material to us . any future acquisitions could involve the issuance of common stock and/or the payment of cash as consideration . the success of our acquisitions will depend , in part , on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated synergies , cost savings and growth opportunities . for example , in the fourth quarter of [XXXX] , we entered into an agreement to sell greensky and sold pfm , both of which we had previously acquired , and in connection with the greensky disposition incurred a write - down of intangible assets and goodwill . we may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems , including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients , counterparties , regulators and others in connection with acquisitions . integration of acquired businesses is time - consuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses , produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties , cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial , management and other resources . it is also possible that an acquisition , once announced , may not close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closing conditions , such as the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals . there is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be successfully integrated or yield all of the expected benefits and synergies in the time frames that we expect , or at all . if we are not able to integrate our acquisitions successfully , our results of operations , financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs

term investment performance , innovation , execution , relative pricing and other factors , including entering into new or expanding current businesses as a result of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives . our ability to sustain or improve our competitive position also depends substantially on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs . we compete with commercial banks , investment banking firms , brokerage firms , insurance companies , exchanges , electronic trading and clearing platforms , financial data repositories , investment advisers and sponsors of mutual funds , hedge funds , real assets funds and private credit and equity funds , energy companies , financial technology firms and other companies offering financial and ancillary services in the u.s . and globally , including , in certain instances , through the internet . in addition , restrictive laws and regulations applicable to certain global financial services institutions , which have been increasing in complexity and volume , may prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions , impose more stringent capital and liquidity requirements , and increase costs , and can put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors in certain businesses not subject to these same requirements . see also “ supervision and regulation ” herein and “ risk factors . ” we compete directly in the u.s . and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker - dealers and with others on a regional or product basis . additionally , there is increased competition driven by established firms and asset managers , as well as the emergence of new firms , non - financial companies and business models , including innovative uses of technology , competing for the same clients and assets , or offering similar products and service s to retail and institutional customers . we also compete with companies that provide online trading and banking services , investment advisory services , robo - advice capabilities , access to digital asset capabilities and services , and other financial products and services . our ability to access capital at competitive rates ( which is generally impacted by , among other things , our credit spreads and ratings ) and to commit and deploy capital efficiently , particularly in our more capital - intensive businesses , including underwriting and sales , trading , financing and market - making activities , also affects our competitive position . we expect clients to continue to request that we provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities . it is possible that competition may become even more intense as we continue to compete with financial or other institutions that may be larger , or better capitalized , or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain geographies or products . many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products and services through different platforms that may enhance their competitive position and could result in additional pricing pressure on our businesses . we continue to experience price competition in some of our businesses . in particular , the ability to execute securities , derivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically on exchanges , swap execution facilities and other automated trading platforms , and the introduction and application of new # # table_start [X] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end technologies will likely continue the pressure on our revenues . the trend toward direct access to automated , electronic markets will likely continue as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms . we have experienced and will likely continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future . our ability to compete successfully in the investment management industry is affected by several factors , including our reputation , quality of investment professionals , performance of investment strategies or product offerings relative to peers and appropriate benchmark indices , advertising and sales promotion efforts , fee levels , the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels and investment pipelines , the types of products offered , and regulatory restrictions specific to fhcs . our investment products , including alternative investment products , may compete with investments offered by other investment managers , including by investment managers who may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than us . supervision and regulation as a major financial services firm , we are subject to extensive regulation by u.s . federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business . we continue to monitor the changing political , tax and regulatory environment . while it is likely that there will be changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the u.s . and other markets in which we operate , it remains difficult to predict the exact impact these changes will have on our business , financial condition , results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period . we expect to remain subject to extensive supervision and regulation . financial holding company consolidated supervision . we operate as a bank holding company ( “ bhc ” ) and fhc under the bhc act and are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision , regulation and examination by the federal reserve . in particular , we are subject to ( among other things ): significant regulation and supervision ; intensive scrutiny of our businesses and plans for expansion of those businesses ; limitations on activities ; a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity requirements ; restrictions on activities and investments imposed by a section of the bhc act added by the dodd -

border transfer of personal and other data that may restrict our ability to conduct business in those jurisdictions or create additional financial and regulatory burdens to do so . numerous jurisdictions have passed laws , rules and regulations in these areas and many are considering new or updated ones that could impact our businesses , particularly as the application , interpretation and enforcement of these laws , rules and regulations are often uncertain and evolving . many aspects of our businesses are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain customer and other information , as well as the privacy and cybersecurity laws referenced above . we have adopted measures designed to comply with these and related applicable requirements in all relevant jurisdictions . for additional information on our cybersecurity strategy and processes , see “ cybersecurity . ” institutional securities and wealth management u.s . bank subsidiaries . our u.s . bank subsidiaries are fdic -

forward - looking statements ” preceding “ business ” and “ return on tangible common equity goal ” in “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . ” market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices , rates , spreads , indices , volatilities , correlations or other market factors , such as market liquidity , will result in losses for a position or portfolio . we have direct exposure to market risk . in addition , market risk may also impact our clients and markets in a manner that may indirectly impact us . for more information on how we monitor and manage market risk , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — market risk . ” our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global financial market and economic conditions and other factors . our results of operations have been in the past and may , in the future , be materially affected by global financial market and economic conditions , including in particular by periods of low or slowing economic growth in the united states and other major markets , both directly and indirectly through their impact on client activity levels . these include the level and volatility of equity , fixed income and commodity prices ; the level , term structure and volatility of interest rates ; inflation and currency values ; the level of other market indices , fiscal or monetary policies established by central banks and financial regulators ; and uncertainty concerning the future path of interest rates , government shutdowns , debt ceilings or funding , which may be driven by economic conditions , recessionary fears , market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and clients due to the effects of widespread events such as global pandemics , natural disasters , climate - related incidents , acts of war or aggression , geopolitical instability , changes in u.s . presidential administrations or congress , changes to global trade policies , supply chain complications and the implementation of tariffs or protectionist trade policies and other factors , or a combination of these or other factors . the results of our institutional securities business segment , particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products , are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we can not control or predict with great certainty . these fluctuations impact results by causing variations in business flows and activity and in the fair value of securities and other financial products . fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity , which , among other things , can be impacted by market uncertainty or lack of investor and client confidence due to unforeseen economic , geopolitical or market conditions that in turn affect the size , number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments . periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions , including equity market levels and the level and pace of changes in interest rates and asset valuation , may have adverse impacts on the level of individual investor confidence and participation in the global markets and/or the level of and mix of client assets , including deposits , which would negatively impact the results of our wealth management business segment . substantial market fluctuations could also cause variations in the value of our investments in our funds , the flow of investment capital into or from aum , and the way customers allocate capital among money market , equity , fixed income or other investment alternatives , which could negatively impact the results of our investment management business segment . the value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations . market volatility , illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the markets may make it difficult to value and monetize certain of our financial instruments , particularly during periods of market uncertainty or displacement . subsequent valuations in future periods , in light of factors then prevailing , may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective fees and performance - based income ( also known as incentive fees , which include carried interest ) in respect of certain businesses . in addition , at the time of any sales and settlements of these financial instruments , the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value . any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments , which may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods . in addition , financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity . under these extreme conditions , hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions . moreover , under these conditions , market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale , which could lead to increased individual counterparty risk for our businesses . although our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves , severe market events have historically been difficult to predict , and we could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur . # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses . concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market - making , investing , underwriting ( including block trading ) and lending businesses ( including margin lending ) in the event of unfavorable market movements . we commit substantial amounts of capital to these businesses , which often results in our taking large positions in the securities of , or making large loans to , a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry , country or region . in the event we hold a concentrated position larger than those held by competitors , we may incur larger losses . for further information regarding our country risk exposure , see also “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — country risks . ” credit risk credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower , counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us . for more information on how we monitor and manage credit risk , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — credit risk . ” we are exposed to the risk that third parties that are indebted to us will not perform their obligations . we incur significant credit risk exposure through our institutional securities business segment . this risk may arise from a variety of business activities , including , but not limited to : extending credit to clients through various lending commitments ; entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us ; acting as clearing broker for listed and over - the - counter derivatives whereby we guarantee client performance to clearinghouses ; providing short- or long - term funding that is secured by physical or financial collater al , including , but not limited to , real estate and marketable securities , whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount ; posting margin and/or collateral and other commitments to clearinghouses , clearing agencies , exchanges , banks , securities firms and other financial counterparties ; and investing and trading in securities and loan pools , whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans . we also incur credit risk in our wealth management business segment lending to mainly individual investors , including , but not limited to , margin- and securities - based loans colla teralized by securities , residential mortgage loans , including home equity lines of credit ( “ helocs ” ) , and structured loans to ultra - high net worth clients , that are in most cases secured by various types of collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount , including marketable securities , private investments , commercial real estate and other financial assets . our valuations related to , and reserves for losses on , credit exposures rely on complex models , estimates and subjective judgments about the future . while we believe current valuations and reserves adequately address our perceived levels of risk , future economic conditions , including inflation and changes in real estate and other asset values , tha t differ from or are more severe than forecast , inaccurate models or assumptions , or external factors such as global pandemics , natural disasters , or geopolitical events , could lead to inaccurate measurement of or deterioration of credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or the value of collateral and result in unexpected losses . we may also incur higher - than - anticipated credit losses as a result of ( i ) disputes with counterparties over the valuation of collateral or ( ii ) actions taken by other lenders that may negatively impact the valuation of collateral . in cases where we foreclose on collateral , sudden declines in the value or liquidity of collateral may result in significant losses to us despite our ( i ) credit monitoring , ( ii ) over - collateralization , ( iii ) ability to call for additional collateral or ( iv ) ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation , especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation . in addition , in the longer term , climate change may have a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients , which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients . certain of our credit exposures may be concentrated by counterparty , pr oduct , sector , portfolio , industry or geographic region . although our models and estimates account for correlations among related types of exposures , a change in the market or economic environment for a concentrated product or an external factor impacting a concentrated counterparty , sector , portfolio , industry or geographic region may result in credit losses in excess of amounts forecast . for further information regarding our country risk exposure , see also “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — country risks . ” in addition , as a clearing member of several central counterparties , we are responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers and could incur financial losses in the event of default by other clearing members . although we regularly review our credit exposures , default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee . a default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets . the commercial soundness of many financial institutions and certain other large financial services firms may be closely interrelated as a result of credit , trading , clearing or other relationships among such entities . increased centralization of trading activities through particular clearinghouses , central agents or exchanges may increase our concentration of risk with respect to these entities . as a result , concerns about , or a default or threatened default by , one or more such entities could lead to significant market - wide liquidity and credit problems , losses or defaults by other institutions , or require # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end financial commitments to multi - lateral actions intended to support market stability . this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries , such as clearinghouses , clearing agencies , exchanges , banks and securities firms , with which we interact on a daily basis and , therefore , could adversely affect us . see also “ systemic risk regime ” under “ business — supervision and regulation — financial holding company . ” operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss , or of damage to our reputation , resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems , from human factors ( e.g. , inappropriate or unlawful conduct ) or from external events ( e.g . , cyberattacks or third - party vulnerabilities ) that may manifest as , for example , loss of information , business disruption , theft and fraud , legal , regulatory and compliance risks , or damage to physical assets . we may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities , including revenue - generating activities and support and control groups ( e.g . , information technology ( "" it "" ) and trade processing ) . legal , regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under “ legal , regulatory and compliance risk . ” for more information on how we monitor and manage operational risk , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — operational risk . ” we are subject to operational risks , including a failure , breach or other disruption of our operations or security systems or those of our third parties ( or third parties thereof ) , as well as human error or malfeasance , which could adversely affect our businesses or reputation . our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report , on a daily basis , a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies . we may introduce new products or services or change processes or reporting , including in connection with new regulatory requirements , or integration of processes or systems of acquired companies , resulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate or identify . the trend toward direct access to automated , electronic markets and the move to more automated trading platforms has resulted in the use of increasingly complex technology that relies on the continued effectiveness of the programming code and integrity of the data to process the trades . we rely on the ability of our employees , our consultants , our internal systems and systems at technology centers maintained by unaffiliated third parties to operate our different businesses and process a high volume of transactions . unusually high trading volumes or site usage could cause our systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail . disruptions to , destruction of , instability of or other failure to effectively maintain our it systems or external technology that allows our clients and customers to use our products and services ( including our self - directed brokerage platform ) could harm our business and our reputation . as a major participant in the global capital markets , we face the risk of incorrect valuation or risk management of our trading positions due to flaws in data , models , electronic trading systems or processes , or due to fraud or cyberattack . we also face the risk of operational failure or disruption of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our lending , securities and derivatives transactions . in addition , in the event of a breakdown or improper operation or disposal of our or a direct or indirect third party ’s systems ( or third parties thereof ) , processes or information assets , or improper or unauthorized action by third parties , including consultants and subcontractors or our employees , we have received in the past and may receive in the future regulatory sanctions , and could suffer financial loss , an impairment to our liquidity position , a disruption of our businesses or damage to our reputation . in addition , the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents , exchanges and clearinghouses , and the increased importance of these entities , increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business . furthermore , the concentration of firm and personal information held by a small number of third parties increases the risk that a breach or disruption at a key third party may cause an industrywide event that could significantly increase the cost and risk of conducting business . these risks may be heightened to the extent that we rely on third parties that are concentrated in a geographic area . there can be no assurance that our business contingency and security response plans fully mitigate all potential risks to us . our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located . this may include a disruption involving physical site access ; software flaws and vulnerabilities ; cybersecurity incidents ; terrorist activities ; political unrest ; disease pandemics ; catastrophic events ; climate - related incidents and natural disasters ( such as earthquakes , tornadoes , floods , hurricanes and wildfires ) ; electrical outages ; environmental hazards ; computer servers ; communication platforms or other services we use ; new technologies ( such as generative artificial intelligence ) ; and our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business . although we employ backup systems for our data , those backup systems may be unavailable following a disruption , the affected data may not have been backed up or may not be recoverable from the backup , or the backup data may be costly to recover , which could adversely affect our business . notwithstanding evolving technology and technology - based risk and control systems , our businesses ultimately rely on people , including our employees and those of third parties with whom we conduct business . as a result of human error or engagement in violations of applicable policies , laws , rules or procedures , certain errors or violations are not always discovered immediately by our technological processes or by # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end our controls and other procedures that are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations . these can include calculation or input errors , inadvertent or duplicate payments , mistakes in addressing emails or other communications , errors in software or model development or implementation , or errors in judgment , as well as intentional efforts to disregard or circumvent applicable policies , laws , rules or procedures . our use of new technologies may be undermined by such human errors or misconduct due to undetected flaws or biases in the algorithms or data utilized by such technologies . human errors and malfeasance , even if promptly discovered and remediated , can result in material losses and liabilities for us , and negatively impact our reputation in the future . we conduct business in various jurisdictions outside the u.s . , including jurisdictions that may not have comparable levels of protection for their corporate assets , such as intellectual property , trademarks , trade secrets , know - how , and customer information and records . the protection afforded in those jurisdictions may be less established and/or predictable than in the u.s . or other jurisdictions in which we operate . as a result , there may also be heightened risks associated with the potential theft of their data , technology and intellectual property in those jurisdictions by domestic or foreign actors , including private parties and those affiliated with or controlled by state actors . additionally , we are subject to complex and evolving u.s . and international laws and regulations governing cybersecurity , privacy and data governance , transfer and protection , which may differ and potentially conflict , in various jurisdictions . any theft of data , technology or intellectual property may negatively impact our operations and reputation , including disrupting the business activities of our subsidiaries , affiliates , joint ventures or clients conducting business in those jurisdictions . a cyberattack , information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or manage our exposure to risk , or result in disclosure or misuse of personal , confidential or proprietary information and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations , liquidity and financial condition , as well as cause reputational harm . cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies ; the use of the internet , mobile telecommunications and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions ; and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime , hackers , terrorists , nation - states , state - sponsored actors and other parties . any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees , customers , clients , vendors or other third parties or users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our networks , systems or data or those of our employees or clients , and such parties may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence . global events and geopolitical instability have also led to increased nation - state targeting of financial institutions in the u.s . and abroad . information security risks may also derive from human error , fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties , software bugs , server malfunctions , software or hardware failure or other technological failure . for example , human error has led to the loss of the firm 's physical data - bearing devices in the past . these risks may be heightened by several factors , including remote work , reliance on new technologies ( such as generative artificial intelligence ) or as a result of the integration of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives that may subject us to new technology , customers or third - party providers . in addition , third parties with whom we do business or share information , and each of their service providers , our regulators and the third parties with whom our customers and clients share information used for authentication , may also be sources of cybersecurity and information security risks , particularly where activities of customers are beyond our security and control systems . there is no guarantee that the measures we take will provide absolute security or recoverability given that the techniques used in cyberattacks are complex , frequently change and are difficult to anticipate . like other financial services firms , the firm , its third - party providers and its clients continue to be the subject of unauthorized access attacks ; mishandling , loss , theft or misuse of information ; computer viruses or malware ; cyberattacks designed to obtain confidential information , destroy data , disrupt or degrade service , sabotage systems or networks or cause other damage ; ransomware ; denial of service attacks ; data breaches ; social engineering attacks ; phishing attacks ; and other events . there can be no assurance that such unauthorized access , mishandling or misuse of information , or cybersecurity incidents will not occur in the future and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale . we maintain a significant amount of personal and confidential information on our customers , clients and certain counterparties that we are required to protect under various state , federal and international data protection and privacy laws . these laws may be in conflict with one another or courts and regulators may interpret them in ways that we had not anticipated or that adversely affect our business . a cyberattack , information or security breach , or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could jeopardize our or our clients ’ , employees ’ , partners ’ , vendors ’ or counterparties ’ personal , confidential , proprietary or other information processed and stored in , and transmitted through , our and our third parties ’ computer systems and networks . furthermore , such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our , our clients ’ , employees ’ , partners ’ , vendors ’ , counterparties ’ or third parties ’ operations , as well as the unauthorized release , gathering , monitoring , misuse , loss or destruction of personal , confidential , proprietary and other information of ours , our employees , our customers or of other third parties . any of these events could result in reputational damage with # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end our clients and the market , client dissatisfaction , additional costs to us to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure , violation of the applicable data protection and privacy laws , regulatory investigations and enforcement actions , litigation exposure , or fines or penalties , any of which could adversely affect our business , financial condition or results of operations . given our global footprint and the high volume of transactions we process ; the large number of clients , partners , vendors and counterparties with which we do business ; and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks , a cyberattack or information or security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection . it could take considerable time for us to determine the scope , extent , amount and type of information compromised , and the impact of such an attack may not be fully understood . during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it , and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated , if at all , all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack or information security incident . while many of our agreements with partners and third - party vendors include indemnification provisions , we may not be able to recover sufficiently , or at all , under such provisions to adequately offset any losses we may incur . in addition , although we maintain insurance coverage that may , subject to policy terms and conditions , cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks , such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any or all losses we may incur , and we can not be sure that such insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms , or at all , or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim . we continue to make investments with a view toward maintaining and enhancing our cybersecurity , resilience and information security posture , including investments in technology and associated technology risk management activities . the cost of managing cybersecurity and information security risks and attacks along with complying with new , increasingly expansive and evolving regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and business . liquidity risk liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets . liquidity risk also encompasses our ability ( or perceived ability ) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern , as well as the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding . for more information on how we monitor and manage liquidity risk , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources ” and “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — liquidity risk . ” liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations . liquidity is essential to our businesses . our liquidity could be negatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the long - term or short - term debt capital markets , our inability to access the secured lending markets , our inability to attract and retain deposits , or unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral by customers or clients . factors that we can not control , such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally , including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the u.s . and other geographic areas , could impair our ability to raise funding . in addition , our ability to raise funding could be impaired if investors , depositors or lenders develop a negative perception of our long - term or short - term financial prospects due to factors such as an incurrence of large trading , credit or operational losses , a downgrade by the rating agencies , a decline in the level of our business activity , if regulatory authorities take significant action against us or our industry , or if we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity . if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above , we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets , such as our investment portfolios or trading assets , to meet maturing liabilities or other obligations . we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount to market value , either of which could adversely affect our results of operations , cash flows and financial condition . our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend on our credit ratings . the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are impacted by ( among other things ) our long - term and short - term credit ratings . the rating agencies continue to monitor certain firm - specific and industrywide factors that are important to the determination of our credit ratings . these include governance , capital adequacy , the level and quality of earnings , liquidity and funding , risk appetite and management , asset quality , strategic direction , business mix , regulatory or legislative changes , macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support , and it is possible that the rating agencies could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions . our credit ratings also can have an adverse impact on certain trading revenues , particularly in those businesses where longer - term counterparty performance is a key consideration , # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end such as otc and other derivative transactions , including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps . in connection with certain otc trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with our institutional securities business segment , we may be required to provide additional collateral to , or immediately settle any outstanding liability balance with , certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade . termination of our trading agreements could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant payments in the form of cash or securities . the additional collateral or termination payments that may occur in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by moody ’s investors service , inc . , s&p global ratings and/or other rating agencies . see also “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings — incremental collateral or terminating payments . ” we are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries . the parent company has no business operations and depends on dividends , distributions , loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations , including debt obligations . regulatory restrictions , tax restrictions or elections and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely , either to or from our subsidiaries . in particular , many of our subsidiaries , including our bank and broker - dealer subsidiaries , are subject to laws , regulations and self - regulatory organization rules that , in certain circumstances , limit , as well as permit regulatory bodies to block or reduce , the flow of funds to the parent company , or that prohibit such transfers or dividends altogether , including steps to “ ring fence ” entities by regulators outside the u.s . to protect clients and creditors of such entities in the event of financial difficulties involving such entities . these laws , regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations . furthermore , as a bhc , we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends . the federal reserve , the occ and the fdic have the authority , and under certain circumstances the duty , to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends or other capital actions by the banking organizations they supervise , including us and our u.s . bank subsidiaries . see “ we may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements ” under “ legal , regulatory and compliance risk ” herein . our liquidity and financial condition have in the past been , and in the future could be , adversely affected by u.s . and international markets and economic conditions . our ability to raise funding in the long - term or short - term debt capital markets or the equity markets , or to access secured lending markets , has in the past been , and could in the future be , adversely affected by conditions in the u.s . and international markets and economies . in particular , our cost and availability of funding in the past have been , and may in the future be , adversely affected by illiquid credit markets , interest rates and wider credit spreads . significant turbulence in the u.s . , the e.u . and other international markets and economies could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us . legal , regulatory and compliance risk legal , regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions ; material financial loss , including fines , penalties , judgments , damages and/or settlements ; limitations on our business ; or loss to reputation we may suffer as a result of our failure to comply with laws , regulations , rules , related self - regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities . this risk also includes contractual and commercial risk , such as the risk that a counterparty ’s performance obligations will be unenforceable . it also includes compliance with aml , terrorist financing and anti - corruption rules and regulations . for more information on how we monitor and manage legal , regulatory and compliance risk , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — legal , regulatory and compliance risk . ” the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation , and changes in regulation will impact our business . like other major financial services firms , we are subject to extensive regulation by u.s . federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business , including an increasing number of complex sanctions and disclosure regimes . these laws and regulations , which continue to increase in volume and complexity , significantly affect the way and costs of doing business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses and limit our ability to expand our product offerings and pursue certain investments . the firm and its employees are subject to wide - ranging regulation and supervision , which , among other things , subject us to intensive scrutiny of our businesses and any plans for expansion of those businesses through acquisitions or otherwise , limitations on activities , a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity and funding requirements and other enhanced prudential standards , # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end resolution regimes and resolution planning requirements , requirements for maintaining minimum amounts of tlac and external long - term debt , restrictions on activities and investments imposed by the volcker rule , comprehensive derivatives regulation , interest rate benchmark requirements , commodities regulation , market structure regulation , consumer protection regulation , tax regulations and interpretations , antitrust laws , trade and transaction reporting obligations , broadened fiduciary obligations and disclosure requirements . new laws , rules , regulations and guidelines , as well as ongoing implementation of , our efforts to comply with , and/or changes to laws , rules , regulations and guidelines , including changes in the breadth , application , interpretation or enforcement of laws , rules , regulations and guidelines , could materially impact the profitability of our businesses and the value of assets we hold , impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate , expose us to additional theories of liability and additional costs , require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses , adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to raise capital , including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors . in addition , regulatory requirements that are imposed by foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations that we are subject to in the u.s . and may adversely affect us . the application of regulatory requirements and strategies in the u.s . or other jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions may pose a greater risk of loss for our security holders and subject us to other restrictions . we are required to submit once every two years to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the u.s . bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure . if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that our resolution plan submission was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution , and if we were unsuccessful in addressing any deficiencies identified by the regulators , we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital , leverage , or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth , activities or operations , or after a two - year period , we may be required to divest assets or operations . in addition , provided that certain procedures are met , we can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under title ii of the dodd - frank act with the fdic being appointed as receiver instead of being resolved under the u.s . bankruptcy code . the fdic ’s power under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the priority of creditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors differently in certain circumstances , subject to certain limitations , could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt . see “ business — supervision and regulation ” and “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — regulatory requirements . ” further , because both our resolution plan contemplates an spoe strategy under the u.s . bankruptcy code and the fdic has proposed an spoe strategy through which it may apply its orderly liquidation authority powers , we believe that the application of an spoe strategy is the reasonably likely outcome if either our resolution plan were implemented or a resolution proceeding were commenced under the orderly liquidation authority . an spoe strategy generally contemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity by the parent company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy , and the parent company has entered into a secured amended and restated support agreement with such entities , pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity to such entities . in addition , a wholly owned , direct subsidiary of the parent company , morgan stanley holdings llc ( “ funding ihc ” ) , serves as a resolution funding vehicle . the parent company has transferred , and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis , certain assets to the funding ihc . in the event of a resolution scenario , the parent company would be obligated to contribute all of its material assets that can be contributed under the terms of the amended and restated support agreement ( other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets ) to the funding ihc . the funding ihc would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity , as applicable , to certain supported subsidiaries , pursuant to the terms of the secured amended and restated support agreement . the obligations of the parent company and of the funding ihc , respectively , under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the parent company ( other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets ) , and the assets of the funding ihc , as applicable . as a result , claims of certain supported subsidiaries , including the funding ihc , against the assets of the parent company with respect to such secured assets are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the parent company . although an spoe strategy , whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or in a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority , is intended to result in better outcomes for creditors overall , there is no guarantee that the application of an spoe strategy , including the provision of support to the parent company ’s supported subsidiaries pursuant to the secured amended and restated support agreement , will not result in greater losses for holders of our securities compared with a different resolution strategy for us . regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an spoe strategy under the u.s . bankruptcy code , # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end the orderly liquidation authority and other resolution regimes . for example , the federal reserve requires top - tier bhcs of u.s . g - sibs , including the firm , to maintain adequate tlac , including equity and eligible long - term debt , in order to ensure that such institutions have enough loss - absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible tlac where the spoe strategy is used . the combined implication of the spoe resolution strategy and the tlac requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible long - term debt and other forms of eligible tlac issued by the parent company before any losses are imposed on the creditors of our supported subsidiaries without requiring taxpayer or government financial support . in addition , certain jurisdictions , including the u.k . and e.u . jurisdictions , have implemented , or are in the process of implementing , changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity . such “ bail - in ” powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors . this may increase the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis and may result in limitations on our ability to efficiently distribute capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities , including in times of stress . non - u.s . regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of tlac that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the parent company and , ultimately , to security holders of the parent company in the event of failure . we may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements . we are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision , regulation and examination by the federal reserve , including with respect to regulatory capital requirements , stress testing and capital planning . we submit , on at least an annual basis , a capital plan to the federal reserve describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders , proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take . our ability to take capital actions described in the capital plan is dependent on , among other factors , the results of supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve . in addition , the federal reserve may change regulatory capital requirements to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose other regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our operating expenses or constrain our ability to take capital actions . for additional information , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources . ” the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement investigations , and we may face damage to our reputation and legal liability . as a global financial services firm , we face the risk of investigations and proceedings by governmental and self - regulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct our business . these investigations and proceedings , as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought , continue to impact the financial services industry . certain u.s . and international governmental entities have brought criminal actions against , or have sought criminal convictions , pleas , deferred prosecution agreements or non - prosecution agreements from financial institutions . significant regulatory or law enforcement action against us could materially adversely affect our business , reputation , financial condition or results of operations , and increase our exposure to civil litigation . investigations and proceedings initiated by these authorities may result in adverse judgments , settlements , fines , penalties , disgorgement , restitution , forfeiture , injunctions or other relief , and have included and may in the future include requirements that the firm admit certain conduct , which may result in increased exposure to civil litigation . in addition , these measures have caused and may in the future cause collateral consequences . for example , such matters could impact our ability to engage in , or impose limitations on , certain of our businesses . as part of the resolution of certain investigations and proceedings , the firm has been and may in the future be required to undertake certain measures and failure to do so may result in adverse consequences , such as further investigations or proceedings — both civil and criminal — and additional penalties , fines , judgments or other relief . the dodd - frank act also provides compensation to whistleblowers who present the sec or cftc with information related to securities or commodities law violations that leads to a successful enforcement action . as a result of this compensation , it is possible we could face an increased number of investigations by the sec or cftc . we have been named , from time to time , as a defendant in various legal actions , including arbitrations , class actions and other litigation , as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies , arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution . certain of the actual or threatened legal or regulatory actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages , or may result in material penalties , fines or other results adverse to us . in some cases , the third - party entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt , in financial distress or may not honor applicable indemnification # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end obligations . in other cases , including antitrust litigation , we may be subject to claims for joint and several liability with other defendants for treble damages or other relief related to alleged conspiracies involving other institutions . like any large corporation , we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct , including noncompliance with policies , laws , rules and regulations , and improper use or disclosure of confidential information , or improper sales practices or other conduct . we may be responsible for representations and warranties associated with commercial and residential real estate loans and may incur losses in excess of our reserves . we originate loans secured by commercial and residential properties . further , we securitize and trade in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate - related assets and products . in connection with these activities , we have provided , or otherwise agreed to be responsible for , certain representations and warranties . under certain circumstances , we may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties were breached , and may incur losses as a result . we have also made representations and warranties in connection with our role as an originator of certain loans that we securitized in cmbs and rmbs . for additional information , see note [XX] to the financial statements . a failure to address conflicts of interest appropriately could adversely affect our businesses and reputation . as a global financial services firm that provides products and services to a large and diversified group of clients , including corporations , governments , financial institutions and individuals , we face potential conflicts of interest in the normal course of business . for example , potential conflicts can occur when there is a divergence of interests between us and a client , among clients , between an employee on the one hand and us or a client on the other , or situations in which we may be a creditor of a client . moreover , we utilize multiple brands and business channels , including those resulting from our acquisitions , and continue to enhance the collaboration across business segments , which may heighten the potential conflicts of interest or the risk of improper sharing of information . we have policies , procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address potential conflicts of interest , and we utilize various measures , such as the use of disclosure , to manage these potential conflicts . however , identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and challenging and can become the focus of media and regulatory scrutiny . indeed , actions that merely appear to create a conflict can put our reputation at risk even if the likelihood of an actual conflict has been mitigated . it is possible that potential conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions , which may lead to our clients being less willing to enter into transactions in which a conflict may occur and could adversely affect our businesses and reputation . our regulators also have the ability to scrutinize our activities for potential conflicts of interest , including through detailed examinations of specific transactions . for example , our status as a bhc supervised by the federal reserve subjects us to direct federal reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions between our u.s . bank subsidiaries and their affiliates . further , the volcker rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain transactions between us and our clients . risk management our risk management strategies , models and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk , which could result in unexpected losses . we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future . nonetheless , our risk management strategies , models and processes , including our use of various risk models for assessing market , credit , liquidity and operational exposures and hedging strategies , stress testing and other analysis , may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk , including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated . as our businesses change and grow , including through acquisitions and the introduction and application of new technologies , such as artificial intelligence , and the markets in which we operate evolve , our risk management strategies , models and processes may not always adapt with those changes . some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management ’s judgment . as a result , these methods may not predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . in addition , many models we use are based on assumptions or inputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators and , therefore , can not anticipate sudden , unanticipated , or unidentified market or economic movements , such as the impact of a pandemic or a sudden geopolitical conflict , which could cause us to incur losses . management of market , credit , liquidity , operational , model , legal , regulatory and compliance risks requires , among other things , policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events , and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective . our trading risk management strategies and techniques also seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses . while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes . for example , to the extent that our trading or investing activities involve less liquid trading markets or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sales or hedging , we may not be able to reduce our positions and , therefore , reduce our risk associated with such positions . we may , therefore , incur losses in the course of our trading or investing activities . for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks and related strategies , models and processes , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — market risk . ” climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could result in increased costs and risks and adversely affect our operations , businesses and clients . there continues to be increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters . the physical risks of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute , climate - related events , such as floods , hurricanes , heatwaves , droughts , and wildfires and chronic , longer - term shifts in climate patterns , such as higher global average temperatures , rising sea levels and long - term droughts . such events could disrupt our operations or those of our clients or third parties on which we rely , including through direct damage to physical assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility . these events could impact the ability of certain of our clients or customers to repay their obligations , reduce the value of collateral , increase costs , including the cost or availability of insurance coverage , and result in other adverse effects . the transition risks of climate change include policy , legal , technology and market changes . examples of these transition risks include changes in consumer and business sentiment , related technologies , shareholder preferences and any additional regulatory and legislative requirements , including increased disclosure or carbon taxes . these risks could increase our expenses and adversely impact our strategies , including by limiting our ability to pursue certain business activities or offer certain products and services . negative impacts to certain of our clients , such as decreased profitability and asset write - downs , could also lead to increased credit , counterparty and liquidity risk to us . in addition , our reputation and client relationships may be adversely impacted as a result of our , or our clients ’ , involvement in certain practices that may have , or are associated with having , an adverse impact on climate change . legislative or regulatory change regarding climate - related risks , including inconsistent requirements and uncertainties , could result in loss of revenue , or increased credit , market , liquidity , regulatory , compliance , reputational and other risks and costs . our ability to achieve our climate - related targets and commitments and the way we go about this could also result in reputational harm as a result of public sentiment , legislative and regulatory scrutiny ( including from u.s . federal and state governments and foreign policymakers and regulators ) , litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence . if we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our current response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient , or the way we respond is perceived negatively , our business and reputation may suffer . the risks associated with , and the perspective of regulators , governments , shareholders , employees and other stakeholders regarding , climate change , as well as geopolitical events , continue to evolve rapidly , making it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate - related risks and uncertainties . as climate risk is interconnected with other risks , we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management practices and governance structures . despite our risk management practices , the unpredictability surrounding the timing and severity of climate - related events and societal or political changes in reaction to them make it difficult to predict , identify , monitor and mitigate climate risks . in addition , the methodologies and data used to manage and monitor climate risk continue to evolve . current approaches utilize information and estimates that have been derived from information or factors released by third - party sources , which may not reflect the latest or most accurate data . climate - related data , particularly greenhouse gas emissions for clients and counterparties , remains limited in availability and varies in quality . certain third - party information may also change over time as methodologies evolve and are refined . while we believe this information is the best available at the time , we may only be able to complete limited validation . furthermore , modeling capabilities and methodologies to analyze climate - related risks , although improving , remain nascent and emerging . these and other factors could cause results to differ materially , which could impact our ability to manage climate - related risks . replacement or reform of certain interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our business , securities , financial condition and results of operations . central banks around the world , including the federal reserve , have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace libor and replace or reform certain other interest rate benchmarks ( collectively , the “ ibors ” ) . a transition away from use of the ibors to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has been underway for a number of years . these reforms have caused and may in the future cause such rates to perform differently than in the past , or to cease entirely , or have other consequences that are contrary to market expectations . the ongoing market transition away from these interest rate benchmarks to alternative reference rates is complex and # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end could have a range of adverse impacts on our business , securities , financial condition and results of operations , including : • adversely impacting the pricing , liquidity , value of , return on and trading for a broad array of financial products , including any securities , loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities that are linked to these interest rate benchmarks ; • inquiries , reviews or other actions from regulators in respect of our ( or the market ’s ) preparation , readiness , transition plans and actions regarding the replacement of a legacy interest rate benchmark with one or more alternative reference rates ; • disputes , litigation or other actions with clients , counterparties and investors in various scenarios , such as regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in ibor - based products such as fallback language or other related provisions , including in the case of fallbacks to the alternative reference rates , any economic , legal , operational or other impact resulting from the fundamental differences between the ibors and the various alternative reference rates or regarding the interpretation of applicable legislation , regulations or rules ; and • causing us to incur additional costs in relation to any of the above factors . other factors include the pace of the transition to the alternative reference rates , timing mismatches between cash and derivative markets , the specific terms and parameters for and market acceptance of any alternative reference rate , market conventions for the use of any alternative reference rate in connection with a particular product ( including the timing and market adoption of any conventions proposed or recommended by any industry or other group ) , prices of and the liquidity of trading markets for products based on alternative reference rates , and our ability to further transition and develop appropriate systems and analytics for one or more alternative reference rates . see also “ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — regulatory requirements — regulatory developments and other matters . ” competitive environment we face strong competition from financial services firms and others , which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability . the financial services industry and all aspects of our businesses are intensely competitive , and we expect them to remain so . we compete with commercial banks , investment banking firms , brokerage firms , insurance companies , exchanges , electronic trading and clearing platforms , financial data repositories , investment advisers and sponsors of mutual funds , hedge funds , real assets funds and private credit and equity funds , energy companies , financial technology firms and other companies offering financial and ancillary services in the u.s . and globally , including , in certain instances , through the internet . we also compete with companies that provide online trading and banking services , investment advisory services , robo - advice capabilities , access to digital asset capabilities and services , and other financial products and services . we compete on the basis of several factors , including transaction execution , capital or access to capital , products and services , innovation , technology , reputation , risk appetite and price . over time , certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated , as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have left businesses , been acquired by or merged into other firms , or have declared bankruptcy . such changes could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources , such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity , or new competitors may emerge . we have experienced and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices , eliminating commissions or other fees , or providing more favorable terms of business . in addition , certain of our competitors may be subject to different and , in some cases , less stringent , legal and regulatory regimes than we are , thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage . some new competitors in the financial technology sector have sought to target existing segments of our businesses that could be susceptible to disruption by innovative or less regulated business models . for more information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate , see “ business — competition ” and “ business — supervision and regulation . ” automated trading markets and the introduction and application of new technologies may adversely affect our business and may increase competition . we continue to experience price competition in some of our businesses . in particular , the ability to execute securities , derivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically on exchanges , swap execution facilities and other automated trading platforms , and the introduction and application of new technologies , including generative artificial intelligence , will likely continue the pressure on revenues . the trend toward direct access to automated , electronic markets will likely continue as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms . we have experienced and will likely continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future . our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance . our people are our most important asset . we compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end and skilled personnel . if we are unable to continue to attract , integrate and retain highly qualified employees or successfully transition key roles , or do so at levels or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive position , our performance , including our competitive position and results of operations , could be materially adversely affected . our ability to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel depends on numerous factors , some of which are outside of our control . compensation costs required to attract and retain employees may increase or the competitive market for talent may further intensify due to factors such as low unemployment , a strong job market and changes in employees ’ expectations , concerns and preferences . the financial industry has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation than other industries , which may or may not impact competitors . these more stringent regulations have shaped our compensation practices , which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees . international risk we are subject to numerous political , economic , legal , tax , operational , franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations that could adversely impact our businesses in many ways . we are subject to numerous political , economic , legal , tax , operational , franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries , including risks of possible nationalization , expropriation , price controls , capital controls , exchange controls , increased taxes and levies , minimum global tax regimes , cybersecurity , data transfer and outsourcing restrictions , regulatory scrutiny regarding the use of new technologies , prohibitions on certain types of foreign and capital market activities , limitations on cross - border listings and other restrictive governmental actions , as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability , including tensions between china and the u.s . , the expansion or escalation of hostilities between russia and ukraine or in the middle east or the initiation or escalation of hostilities or terrorist activity around the world and the potential associated impacts on global and local economies and our operations . in many countries , the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and multinational corporations are uncertain , evolving and subject to sudden change or may be inconsistent with u.s . law . it may also be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or adapt to changes in law , which could adversely impact our businesses . our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally . we are also subject to the risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases . various emerging market countries have experienced severe political , economic or financial disruptions , including significant devaluations of their currencies , defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt , capital and currency exchange controls , high rates of inflation and low or negative growth rates in their economies . crime and corruption , as well as issues of security and personal safety , also exist in certain of these countries . these conditions could adversely impact our businesses and increase volatility in financial markets generally . a disease pandemic , such as covid-19 and its variants , or other widespread health emergencies , natural disasters , climate - related incidents , terrorist activities or military actions , or social or political tensions , could create economic and financial disruptions in emerging markets or in other areas of the global economy that could adversely affect our businesses , or could lead to operational difficulties , including travel limitations and supply chain complications , that could impair our ability to manage or conduct our businesses around the world . as a u.s . company , we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by ofac and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies worldwide , which may be inconsistent with local law . we and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to applicable aml and/or anti - corruption laws in the u.s . , as well as in the jurisdictions in which we operate , including the bank secrecy act , the u.s . foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k . bribery act . a violation of a sanction , embargo program , aml or anti - corruption law could subject us , and individual employees , to a regulatory enforcement action , as well as significant civil and criminal penalties . acquisition , divestiture and joint venture risk we may be unable to fully capture the expected value from acquisitions , divestitures , joint ventures , partnerships , minority stakes or strategic alliances , and certain acquisitions may subject our business to new or increased risk . in connection with past or future acquisitions , divestitures , joint ventures , partnerships , minority stakes or strategic alliances ( including with mitsubishi ufj financial group , inc . ( “ mufg ” ) ) , we face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining , transferring , separating or integrating the relevant businesses and systems that may present operational and other risks , including the need to combine or separate accounting , data processing and other systems , management controls and legal entities , and to integrate relationships with clients , trading counterparties and business partners . certain of these strategic initiatives , and integration thereof , may cause us to incur incremental expenses and may also require incremental financial , management and other resources . in the case of joint ventures , partnerships and minority stakes , we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties because # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end we may be dependent upon , and subject to liability , losses or reputational damage relating to systems , controls and personnel that are not under our control , and conflicts or disagreements between us and any of our joint venture partners or partners may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved by the relevant joint venture or partnership , respectively . there is no assurance that any of our acquisitions , divestitures or investments will be successfully integrated or disaggregated or yield all of the positive benefits and synergies anticipated . if we are not able to integrate or disaggregate successfully our past and future acquisitions or dispositions , including aligning the processes , policies and procedures of the acquired entities with our standards , there is a risk that our results of operations , financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected . certain of our business initiatives , including expansions of existing businesses , may change our client or account profile or bring us into contact , directly or indirectly , with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes , services , competitors and new markets . these business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks , greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities , increased credit - related , sovereign , compliance and operational risks , as well as franchise and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held , or services are being delivered . for more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate , see also “ business — supervision and regulation . ” # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] -

party vendors . we maintain a third - party risk management program that includes evaluation of , and response to , cybersecurity risks at our third - party vendors . prior to engaging third - party vendors to provide services to the firm , we conduct assessments of the third - party vendors ’ cybersecurity programs to identify the impact of their services on the cybersecurity risks to the firm . once on - boarded , third - party vendors ’ cybersecurity programs are subject to risk - based oversight , which may include security questionnaires , submission of independent security audit reports or a firm audit of the third - party vendor ’s security program , and , with limited exceptions , third - party vendors are required to meet our cybersecurity standards . where a third - party vendor can not meet those standards , its services , and the residual risk to the firm , are subject to review , challenge and escalation through our risk management processes and erm committees , which may ultimately result in requesting increased security measures or ceasing engagement with such third - party vendor . our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed by the internal audit department ( “ iad ” ) through various assurance activities , with the results reported to the audit committee of the board ( “ bac ” ) and the botc . annually , certain elements of the cybersecurity program are subject to an audit by an independent consultant , as well as an assessment by a separate , independent third party , the results of which , including opportunities identified for improvement and related remediation plans , are reviewed with the botc . our cybersecurity program is also examined regularly by the firm ’s prudential and conduct regulators within the scope of their jurisdiction . governance management ’s role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats our cybersecurity program is operated and maintained by management , including the chief information officer of cyber , data , risk and resilience ( “ cio ” ) and the chief information security officer ( “ ciso ” ) . these senior officers # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] -

emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage , hydrogen , lower - emission fuels , and lithium . affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses . exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates , many with names that include exxonmobil , exxon , esso , mobil or xto . for convenience and simplicity , in this report the terms exxonmobil , exxon , esso , mobil , and xto , as well as terms like corporation , company , our , we , and its , are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates . the precise meaning depends on the context in question . in october [XXXX] the corporation entered into a merger agreement with pioneer natural resources company ( pioneer ) , an independent oil and gas exploration and production company , in exchange for exxonmobil common stock . the transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of [XXXX] , subject to regulatory approvals . for additional information , see "" note [XX] : mergers and acquisitions "" in the financial section of this report . the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive , both within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy , fuel , and chemical needs of industrial and individual consumers . certain industry participants , including exxonmobil , are expanding investments in lower - emission energy and emission - reduction services and technologies . the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes . operating data and industry segment information for the corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the following : “ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations : business results ” and “ note [XX] : disclosures about segments and related information ” . information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “ oil and gas reserves ” part of the “ supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities ” portion of the financial section of this report . exxonmobil has a long - standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology . we have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our businesses . exxonmobil held over [X] thousand active patents worldwide at the end of [XXXX] . for technology licensed to third parties , revenues totaled approximately $ [XXX] million in [XXXX] . although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our company , the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent , trade secret , trademark , license , franchise , or concession . exxonmobil operates in a highly complex , competitive , and changing global energy business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length . this long - term orientation underpins the corporation 's philosophy on talent development . talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle . our career - oriented approach to talent development results in strong retention and an average length of service of about [XX] years for our career employees . compensation , benefits , and workplace programs support the corporation 's talent management approach , and are designed to attract and retain employees for a career through compensation that is market competitive , long - term oriented , and highly differentiated by individual performance . over [XX] percent of our global employee workforce is from outside the u.s . , and over the past decade [XX] percent of our global hires for management , professional and technical positions were female and [XX] percent of our u.s . hires for management , professional and technical positions were minorities . with over [XXX] nationalities represented in the company , we encourage and respect diversity of thought , ideas , and perspective from our workforce . we consider and monitor diversity through all stages of employment , including recruitment , training , and development of our employees . we also work closely with the communities where we operate to identify and invest in initiatives that help support local needs , including local talent and skill development . the number of regular employees was [XX] thousand , [XX] thousand , and [XX] thousand at years ended [XXXX] , [XXXX] , and [XXXX] , respectively . regular employees are defined as active executive , management , professional , technical , administrative , and wage employees who work full time or part time for the corporation and are covered by the corporation ’s benefit plans and programs . as discussed in "" item 1a . risk factors "" in this report , compliance with existing and potential future government regulations , including taxes , environmental regulations , and other government regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the production and sale of our products , may have material effects on the capital expenditures , earnings , and competitive position of exxonmobil . for additional information on the corporation 's worldwide environmental expenditures , see "" management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations : environmental matters "" in the financial section of this report . information concerning the source and availability of raw materials used in the corporation ’s business , the extent of seasonality in the business , the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of governments , and risks attendant to foreign operations may be found in “ item 1a . risk factors ” and “ item [X] . properties ” in this report . exxonmobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com . our annual report on form [XX] -

emission business opportunities . many of these risk factors are not within the company ’s control and could adversely affect our business , our financial and operating results , or our financial condition . these risk factors include : supply and demand the oil , gas , and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses . this means exxonmobil ’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil , gas , and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products . oil , gas , petrochemical , and product prices and margins in turn depend on local , regional , and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product . any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company ’s operations , financial condition , and proved reserves , especially in the upstream segment . on the other hand , a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company ’s operations , especially in the energy products , chemical products , and specialty products segments . our pursuit of lower - emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage , hydrogen , lower - emission fuels , and lithium also depends on the growth and development of markets for those products and services , including implementation of supportive government policies and developments in technology to enable those products and services to be provided on a cost - effective basis at commercial scale . see "" climate change and the energy transition "" in this item 1a . economic conditions . the demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad - based economic activities and levels of prosperity . the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results . other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region , such as changes in population growth rates , periods of civil unrest , government regulation or austerity programs , trade tariffs or broader breakdowns in global trade , security or public health issues and responses , or currency exchange rate fluctuations , can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals . sovereign debt downgrades , defaults , inability to access debt markets due to rating , banking , or legal constraints , liquidity crises , the breakup or restructuring of fiscal , monetary , or political systems such as the european union , and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil , including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil . our future business results , including cash flows and financing needs , may also be affected by the occurrence , severity , pace and rate of recovery of future public health epidemics or pandemics ; the responsive actions taken by governments and others ; and the resulting effects on regional and global markets and economies . other demand - related factors . other factors that may affect the demand for oil , gas , petrochemicals or our other products , and therefore impact our results , include technological improvements in energy efficiency ; seasonal weather patterns ; increased competitiveness of , or government policy support for , alternative energy sources ; changes in technology that alter fuel choices , such as technological advances in energy storage or other critical areas that make wind , solar , hydrogen , nuclear or other alternatives more competitive for power generation ; changes in consumer preferences for our products , including consumer demand for alternative - fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products ; and broad - based changes in personal income levels . see also “ climate change and the energy transition ” below . other supply - related factors . commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply . for example , increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand . similarly , increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products . world oil , gas , and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies , such as the level of and adherence by participating countries to production quotas established by opec or "" opec+ "" and other agreements among sovereigns ; government policies , including actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs ; the occurrence of wars or hostile actions , including disruption of land or sea transportation routes ; natural disasters ; disruptions in competitors ’ operations ; and logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies . technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find , produce and refine oil and gas , and to manufacture petrochemicals . other market factors . exxonmobil ’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates , inflation , currency exchange rates , changes in usage of the u.s . dollar in global trade , and other local or regional market conditions . in addition to direct potential impacts on our costs and revenues , market factors such as rates of inflation may indirectly impact our results to the extent such factors reduce general rates of economic growth and therefore energy demand , as discussed under “ economic conditions ” . market factors may also result in losses from commodity derivatives and other instruments we use to hedge price exposures or for trading purposes . additional information regarding the potential future impact of market factors on our businesses is included or incorporated by reference under "" item 7a . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk "" in this report . government and political factors exxonmobil ’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations . access limitations . a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources , including by restricting leasing or permitting activities , or may place resources off - limits from development altogether . restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies . restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices or when national governments may have less need for outside sources of private capital . many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin . restrictions on doing business . exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted , including acquiring or divesting certain assets . such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions . lack of legal certainty . some countries in which we do business lack well - developed legal systems , have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks , or may have evolving and unharmonized standards that vary or conflict across jurisdictions . lack of legal certainty exposes us to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials , and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts . in some cases , these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum , but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award . regulatory and litigation risks . even in countries with well - developed legal systems where exxonmobil does business , we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law ( including changes that result from international treaties and accords ) and changes in policy that could adversely affect our results , such as : • increases in taxes , duties , or government royalty rates ( including retroactive claims or punitive taxes on oil , gas and petrochemical operations ) ; • price controls ; • changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of operation or compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities ( including changes in laws affecting offshore drilling operations , standards to complete decommissioning , water use , emissions , hydraulic fracturing , or production or use of new or recycled plastics , as well as laws and regulations affecting trading ) ; • actions by policy - makers , regulators , or other actors to delay or deny necessary licenses and permits , restrict the availability of oil and gas leases or the transportation or export of our products , or otherwise require changes in the company 's business or strategy that could result in reduced returns ; • regulatory interpretations that exclude or disfavor our products under government policies or programs intended to support new or developing markets or technologies , or that otherwise are not technology - neutral ; • adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards , the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components ; • adoption of disclosure regulations that could create competitive disadvantages , require us to incur disproportionate costs , or increase legal risk due to a need to rely on uncertain estimates or extrapolations ( such as emissions of third parties ) and lack of uniform standards across jurisdictions , or by requiring us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or to violate the non - disclosure laws of other countries ; and • government actions to cancel contracts , redenominate the official currency , renounce or default on obligations , renegotiate terms unilaterally , or expropriate assets . legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate . we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation , especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur ; by government enforcement proceedings alleging non - compliance with applicable laws or regulations ; or by state and local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas ( including seeking to reduce the production and sale of hydrocarbon products through litigation targeting the company or other industry participants ) , gain political notoriety , or obtain monetary awards from the company . the continued adoption of similar legal practices in the european union or elsewhere would broaden this risk and has begun to be applied to some of our competitors in the european union . security concerns . successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest , acts of sabotage or terrorism , cybersecurity attacks , the application of national security laws or policies that result in restricting our ability to do business in a particular jurisdiction , and other local security concerns . such concerns may be directed specifically at our company , our industry , or as part of broader movements and may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time . climate change and the energy transition net - zero scenarios . driven by concern over the risks of climate change , a number of countries have adopted , or are considering the adoption of , regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from the production and use of oil and gas and their products as well as the use or support for different emission - reduction technologies . these actions are being taken both independently by national and regional governments and within the framework of united nations conference of the parties summits under which many countries of the world have endorsed objectives to reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) over the coming decades , with an ambition ultimately to achieve “ net zero ” . net zero means that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such gases from the atmosphere . expectations for transition of the world ’s energy system to lower - emission sources , and ultimately net - zero , derive from hypothetical scenarios that reflect many assumptions about the future and reflect substantial uncertainties . the company ’s objective to play a leading role in the energy transition , including the company ’s announced ambition ultimately to achieve net zero with respect to scope [X] and [X] emissions from operations with continued technology development and policy support where exxonmobil is the operator , carries risks that the transition , including underlying technologies , policies , and markets as discussed in more detail below , will not be available or develop at the pace or in the manner expected by current net - zero scenarios . the success of our strategy for the energy transition will also depend on our ability to recognize key signposts of changes in the global energy system on a timely basis , and our corresponding ability to direct investment to the technologies and businesses , at the appropriate stage of development , to best capitalize on our competitive strengths . greenhouse gas restrictions . government actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include adoption of cap and trade regimes , carbon taxes , carbon - based import duties or other trade tariffs , minimum renewable usage requirements , restrictive permitting , increased mileage and other efficiency standards , mandates for sales of electric vehicles , mandates for use of specific fuels or technologies , and other incentives or mandates designed to support certain technologies for transitioning to lower - emission energy sources . political and other actors and their agents also increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly , such as by seeking to reduce the availability or increase the cost of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector . these actions include delaying or blocking needed infrastructure , utilizing shareholder governance mechanisms against companies or their shareholders or financial institutions in an effort to deter investment in oil and gas activities , and taking other actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and gas companies . depending on how policies are formulated and applied , such policies could negatively affect our investment returns , make our hydrocarbon - based products more expensive or less competitive , lengthen project implementation times , and reduce demand for hydrocarbons , as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower - carbon alternatives . current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs , such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions . technology and lower - emission solutions . achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately achieve net zero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources , as well as technologies such as carbon capture and storage ( ccs ) . ccs technologies , focused initially on capturing and sequestering co2 emissions from high - intensity industrial activities , can assist in meeting society ’s objective to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas levels while also helping ensure the availability of the reliable and affordable energy the world requires . exxonmobil has established a low carbon solutions ( lcs ) business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and projects , including ccs , hydrogen , lower - emission fuels , and lithium , breakthrough energy efficiency processes , advanced energy - saving materials , and other technologies . the company ’s efforts include both in - house research and development as well as collaborative efforts with leading universities and with commercial partners involved in advanced lower - emission energy technologies . our future results and ability to grow our lcs business , help nations meet their emission - reduction goals , and succeed through the energy transition will depend in part on the success of these research and collaboration efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost - competitive manner . policy and market development . the scale of the world ’s energy system means that , in addition to developments in technology as discussed above , a successful energy transition will require appropriate support from governments and private participants throughout the global economy . our ability to develop and deploy ccs and other lower - emission energy technologies at commercial scale , and the growth and future returns of lcs and other emerging businesses in which we invest , will depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets . failure or delay of these policies or markets to materialize or be maintained could adversely impact these investments . policy and other actions that result in restricting the availability of hydrocarbon products without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects , including increased commodity price volatility ; periods of significantly higher commodity prices and resulting inflationary pressures ; and local or regional energy shortages . such effects in turn may depress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in policy by different actors , with resulting adverse effects on our businesses . in addition , the existence of supportive policies in any jurisdiction is not a guarantee that those policies will continue in the future . see also the discussion of “ supply and demand , ” “ government and political factors , ” and “ operational and other factors ” in this item 1a . operational and other factors in addition to external economic and political factors , our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are , at least in part , within our control , including our capital allocation into existing and new businesses . the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition . for projects in which we are not the operator , we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co - venturers whom we do not control . exploration and development program . our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts . among other factors , we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources online as scheduled and within budget . project and portfolio management . the long - term success of exxonmobil ’s upstream and product solutions businesses , as well as the future success of lcs and other emerging lower - emission investments , depends on complex , long - term , capital - intensive projects . these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency . specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to : negotiate successfully with joint venturers , partners , governments , suppliers , customers , or others ; model and optimize reservoir performance ; develop markets for project outputs , whether through long - term contracts or the development of effective spot markets ; qualify for certain incentives available under supportive government policies for emerging markets and technologies ; manage changes in operating conditions and costs , including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping , supply - chain disruptions , and inflationary cost pressures ; prevent , to the extent possible , and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project start - up or cause unscheduled project downtime ; and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role . in addition to the effective management of individual projects , exxonmobil ’s success , including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders , depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio , including diversification among types and locations of our projects , products produced , and strategies to acquire or divest assets . we may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies . additionally , we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated . the term “ project ” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports . operational efficiency . an important component of exxonmobil ’s competitive performance , especially given the commodity - based nature of many of our businesses , is our ability to operate efficiently , including our ability to manage expenses , improve production yields on an ongoing basis and successfully integrate and achieve the anticipated synergies of acquisitions , including the acquisition of pioneer natural resources company . this requires continuous management focus , including technology integration and improvements , cost control , productivity enhancements , harmonizing the functions , policies , procedures and processes , regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio , and the recruitment , development , and retention of high caliber employees . research and development and technological change . to maintain our competitive position , especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement , exxonmobil ’s technology , research , and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment , including continuous improvement in the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing technology and developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions . to remain competitive , we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies , including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to our businesses . safety , business controls , and environmental risk management . our results depend on management ’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil , gas , and petrochemical operations , to effectively control our business activities , including trading , and to minimize the potential for human error . we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events . for example , we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management , ongoing upgrades , key equipment replacements , and comprehensive inspection and surveillance . similarly , we are implementing cost - effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce emissions , not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities . we employ a robust and actively evolving enterprise risk management system to identify and manage risk across our businesses . we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework . substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if we do not timely identify and mitigate applicable risks , or if our management systems and controls do not function as intended . cybersecurity . exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of sources including state - sponsored actors . see item 1c in this report for information on exxonmobil ’s program for managing cybersecurity risks . if the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected , exxonmobil , as well as our customers , employees , or third parties , could be adversely affected . we have limited ability to influence third parties , including our partners , suppliers and service providers ( including providers of cloud - hosting services for our data or applications ) , to implement strong cybersecurity controls and are exposed to potential harm from cybersecurity events that may affect their operations . cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment ; damage or destroy assets ; compromise business systems ; result in proprietary information being altered , lost , or stolen ; result in employee , customer , or third - party information being compromised ; or otherwise disrupt our business operations . we could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions , litigation , or reputational harm . preparedness . our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events , natural disasters , human error , and similar events . for example , hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas . our facilities are designed , engineered , constructed , and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions , with safety factors built in to cover a number of uncertainties , including those associated with wave , wind , and current intensity , marine ice flow patterns , permafrost stability , storm surge magnitude , temperature extremes , extreme rainfall events , and earthquakes . our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce . our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering , our rigorous disaster preparedness and response , and business continuity planning . insurance limitations . the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the availability and cost of coverage , which may not be economic , as well as the capacity of the applicable insurance markets , which may not be sufficient . competition . as noted in item [X] above , the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive . we face competition not only from other private firms , but also from state - owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as partners with other private firms . in some cases , these state - owned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners , with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders , such as exxonmobil . technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resource - owning countries to partner with private - sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources . as described in more detail above , our hydrocarbon - based energy products are also subject to growing and , in many cases , government - supported competition from alternative energy sources . reputation . our reputation is an important corporate asset . factors that could have a negative impact on our reputation include an operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption ; changes in consumer views concerning our products ; a perception by investors or others that the corporation is making insufficient progress with respect to our ambition to play a leading role in the energy transition , or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investments with reduced returns ; and other adverse events such as those described in this item 1a . negative impacts on our reputation could in turn make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities , obtain necessary regulatory approvals , obtain financing , and attract talent , or they could reduce consumer demand for our branded products . exxonmobil ’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole . projections , estimates , and descriptions of exxonmobil ’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items [X] , 1a , 1c , [X] , [X] , [X] , and 7a of this report are forward - looking statements . actual future results , including project completion dates , production rates , capital expenditures , costs , and business plans could differ materially due to , among other things , the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report . # # table_start"

end reserves .","item 1a . risk factors as a global energy company , chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company ’s results of operations and financial condition . business and operational risk factors chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility . the most significant factor that affects the company ’s results of operations is the price of crude oil , which can be influenced by general economic conditions and level of economic growth , including low or negative growth ; industry production and inventory levels ; technology advancements , including those in pursuit of a lower carbon economy ; production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries or other producers ; weather - related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control ; competing fuel prices ; geopolitical risks ; the pace of energy transition ; customer and consumer preferences and the use of # # table_start # # table_end substitutes ; and governmental regulations , policies and other actions regarding the development of oil and gas reserves , as well as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change . chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process . an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices . extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company ’s results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . among other things , the company ’s upstream earnings , cash flows , and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected , as could its production and proved reserves . upstream assets may also become impaired . downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales . a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company ’s credit ratings , potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets . the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings , expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns , and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business , including our chevron new energies organization . in some cases , transferred liabilities , including for abandonment and decommissioning of divested oil and gas assets , have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy . in addition , extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations , financial condition and liquidity of the company ’s suppliers , vendors , partners and equity affiliates upon which the company ’s own results of operations and financial condition depend . the scope of chevron ’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business ; therefore , if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions , exploration or technology , the company ’s business will decline . creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors , including obtaining and renewing rights to explore , develop and produce hydrocarbons ; drilling success ; reservoir optimization ; technology advancements ; ability to bring long - lead - time , capital - intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule ; partner alignment , including strategic support ; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties . the company ’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions . the company ’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control , including risks from hurricanes , severe storms , floods , heat waves , other forms of severe weather , wildfires , ambient temperature increases , sea level rise , war or other military conflicts such as the war between israel and hamas and the military conflict between russia and ukraine , accidents , civil unrest , political events , fires , earthquakes , system failures , cyber threats , terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases , some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment . chevron ’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency . while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency , sea level rise , air and water temperature , precipitation , fresh water access , wind speed , and earthquake severity , among other factors , it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing , frequency or severity of such events , any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 's results of operations or financial condition . cyberattacks targeting chevron ’s operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company ’s business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to chevron ’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors , including criminal hackers , state - sponsored intrusions , industrial espionage and employee malfeasance . these cyber threat actors , whether internal or external to chevron , are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company ’s information technology ( it ) systems and data , including the it systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through , without limitation , malicious software ; data privacy breaches by employees , insiders or others with authorized access ; cyber or phishing - attacks ; ransomware ; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems ; and other electronic security breaches . the cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors , including during political tensions , war or other military conflicts , or civil unrest . although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data , whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties , the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business . cyber threat actors could compromise the company ’s operational technology networks or other # # table_start # # table_end critical systems and infrastructure , resulting in disruptions to its business operations , injury to people , harm to the environment or its assets , disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems , or loss , misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information , including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees , customers , partners and other third parties . any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident . further , the company is increasingly experiencing cyber incidents related to its third - party vendors . some third - party vendors house the company ’s critical data and proprietary information on their it systems , including the cloud ; others have access to chevron ’s it systems or provide software through which threat actors could gain access or introduce malware to chevron ’s it systems . regardless of the precise method or form , cyber events could result in significant financial losses , legal or regulatory violations , reputational harm , and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company ’s business and results of operations . the company ’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevron ’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the energy industry . the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner . however , failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents , including releases , explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury , loss of life , environmental damage , loss of revenues , legal liability and/or disruption to operations . chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies , standards , processes and systems , behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety , health , environmental , reliability and efficiency risks ; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies ; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents . in certain situations where chevron is not the operator , the company may have limited influence and control over third parties , which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks . the company does not insure against all potential losses , which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or third - party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss . as a result , the company is , to a substantial extent , self - insured for such events . the company relies on existing liquidity , financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short - term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events . the occurrence of a significant incident , series of events , or unforeseen liability for which the company is self - insured , not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company ’s results of operations or financial condition . chevron may not complete the acquisition of hess corporation within the time frame the company anticipates or at all , which could have adverse effects on chevron the completion of the acquisition of hess corporation ( hess ) is subject to a number of conditions , including regulatory approvals and approval by hess stockholders of the adoption of the merger agreement . additionally , hess and chevron have been engaged in discussions with exxon mobil corporation and china national offshore oil corporation regarding a right of first refusal provision in the joint operating agreement for the stabroek block offshore guyana . if these discussions do not result in an acceptable resolution and arbitration ( if pursued ) does not result in a confirmation that such right of first refusal provision is inapplicable to the merger , then there would be a failure of a closing condition under the merger agreement , in which case the merger would not close . for additional information , please see the section entitled “ the merger — stabroek joa ” in chevron ’s preliminary registration statement on form s-4 to be filed on february [XX] , [XXXX] . further , on december [X] , [XXXX] , chevron and hess each received a request for additional information and documentary materials ( second request ) from the federal trade commission ( ftc ) in connection with the ftc ’s review of the merger . issuance of the second request extends the waiting period imposed by the hart - scott - rodino antitrust improvements act of [XXXX] , as amended , until [XX] days after chevron and hess have substantially complied with the second request , unless that period is extended voluntarily by chevron and hess or terminated sooner by the ftc . the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all . in addition , the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the acquisition that are granted , if any , may impose requirements , limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the company ’s business after the transaction or materially delay the completion of the acquisition . a delay in completing the acquisition could cause the company to realize some or all of the benefits later than we otherwise expect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated timeframe , which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the acquisition . # # table_start # # table_end acquisitions may cause chevron ’s financial results to differ from the company ’s expectations or the expectations of the investment community , the company may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition , and the acquisition may disrupt the company ’s current plans or operations the success of prior acquisitions , such as pdc energy , inc . ( pdc ) , and the pending acquisition of hess will depend , in part , on chevron ’s ability to successfully integrate each of the businesses of pdc and hess and realize the anticipated benefits , including synergies . difficulties in integrating pdc and hess may result in the failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframes , in operational challenges , and in the diversion of management ’s attention from ongoing business concerns , as well as in unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisitions , which may have an adverse impact on the company ’s financial results . legal , regulatory and esg - related risk factors chevron ’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces , transports , refines and markets potentially hazardous materials , and it purchases , handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business . chevron ’s operations also produce byproducts , which may be considered pollutants . often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control . any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action . for example , liability or delays could result from an accidental , unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company ’s operations on human health or the environment . in addition , to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved , it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company ’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage , or to other mitigating factors . for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved , see note [XX] litigation . political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm chevron ’s business the company ’s operations , particularly exploration and production , can be affected by changing political , regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates . as has occurred in the past , actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company ’s partially or wholly owned businesses , to force contract renegotiations , or to impose additional taxes or royalties . in certain locations , governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company ’s operations , trade , currency exchange controls , burdensome taxes , and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company ’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties . in other countries , political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company ’s continued presence in those countries , and internal unrest , acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company ’s operations . those developments have , at times , significantly affected the company ’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries . further , chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the united states and other jurisdictions where we operate , such as sanctions imposed in venezuela and russia , which , depending upon their scope , could adversely impact the company ’s operations and financial results in these countries . in addition , litigation or changes in national , state or local environmental regulations or laws , including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas , such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling , or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products , could adversely affect the company ’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability . legislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose chevron to additional tax liabilities changes in tax laws and regulations around the world are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the company ’s control . chevron ’s taxes in the jurisdictions where the company conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations , including but not limited to , substantive changes in , reductions in , or the repeal or expiration of tax incentives , such as u.s . federal tax incentives for biodiesel blending , which expire in [XXXX] . furthermore , chevron ’s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world . there is no assurance that taxing authorities or courts will agree with the positions that chevron has reflected on the company ’s tax returns , in which case interest and penalties could be imposed that may have a material adverse effect on the company ’s results of operations or financial condition . during periods of high profitability for certain companies or industries , there are often calls for increased taxes on profits , often called “ windfall profit ” taxes . governments in various jurisdictions , including california and australia , have announced , proposed , or implemented windfall profit taxes for companies operating in the energy and oil and gas sectors . such taxes may be imposed on us or may be increased in the future in these or other jurisdictions . the imposition of , or # # table_start # # table_end increase in , such windfall profit taxes could adversely affect the company ’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability . for information concerning the company ’s tax liabilities , see note [XX] taxes and note [XX] other contingencies and commitments . legislation , regulation , and other government actions and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions and climate change could continue to increase chevron ’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron ’s hydrocarbon and other products , resulting in a material adverse effect on the company ’s results of operations and financial condition chevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of international and domestic legislation , regulation , or other government actions relating to ghg emissions ( e.g. , carbon dioxide and methane ) and climate change . international agreements and national , regional , and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce ghg emissions are in various stages of implementation . legislation , regulation , and other government actions related to ghg emissions and climate change could reduce demand for chevron ’s hydrocarbon and other products and/or continue to increase chevron ’s operational costs and reduce its return on investment . the paris agreement went into effect in november [XXXX] , and a number of countries in which we operate have adopted and may adopt additional policies intended to meet their paris agreement goals . globally , multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate ghg emissions through a carbon tax , a cap - and - trade program , performance standards or other mechanisms , or to attempt to indirectly advance reduction of ghg emissions through restrictive permitting , procurement standards , trade barriers , minimum renewable usage requirements , financing standards , standards or requirements for environmental benefit claims , increased ghg reporting and climate - related disclosure requirements , or tax advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy , fuel sources or lower - carbon technologies . for example , the company is currently subject to implemented programs in certain jurisdictions , such as the renewable fuel standard program in the u.s . , california ’s cap - and - trade program and low carbon fuel standard , and newly approved mandates such as the california air resources board advanced clean cars ii regulations , as well as other indirect regulation of ghg emissions , which may , among other things , ban or restrict technologies or products that use the company ’s products . ghg emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include , among others , those associated with the company ’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons ; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil ; power generation ; the conversion of crude oil , natural gas and biofeedstocks into refined hydrocarbon products ; the processing , liquefaction , and regasification of natural gas ; the transportation of crude oil , natural gas , and other products ; and customers ’ and consumers ’ use of the company ’s hydrocarbon products . in addition , the u.s . inflation reduction act ( ira ) implements various incentives for lower carbon activities , including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel . although the ira offers incentives that could support certain lower carbon lines of business , those same incentives could negatively impact supply and/or demand for our oil and gas products in the future or any existing or future lower carbon business lines . many of these actions , as well as customers ’ and consumers ’ preferences and use of the company ’s products or substitute products , and actions taken by the company ’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations , are beyond the company ’s control . similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment , climate change - related legislation , regulation , or other government actions may curtail profitability in oil and gas and lower carbon businesses , as well as render the extraction of the company ’s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible . in particular , ghg emissions - related legislation , regulations , and other government actions , and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing ghg emissions may result in increased and substantial capital , compliance , operating , and maintenance costs and could , among other things , reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company ’s hydrocarbon - based products ; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources ; make the company ’s products more expensive ; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company ’s resources ; impact or limit our business plans ; and adversely affect the company ’s sales volumes , revenues , margins and reputation . for example , some jurisdictions are in various stages of design , adoption , and implementation of policies and programs that cap emissions and/or require short- , medium- , and long - term ghg reductions by operators at the asset or facility level , which may not be technologically feasible , or which could require significant capital expenditure , increase costs of or limit production , result in impairment of assets and limit chevron ’s ability to cost - effectively reduce ghg emissions across its global portfolio . the ultimate effect of international agreements ; national , regional , and state legislation and regulation ; and government and private actions related to ghg emissions and climate change on the company ’s financial performance , and the timing of # # table_start # # table_end these effects , will depend on a number of factors . such factors include , among others , the sectors covered , the ghg emissions reductions required , standardized carbon accounting , the extent to which chevron would be able to receive , generate , or purchase credits , the price and availability of credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover , or continue to recover , the costs incurred through the pricing of the company ’s products in the competitive marketplace . further , the ultimate impact of ghg emissions and climate change - related agreements , legislation , regulation , and government actions on the company ’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty , for a multitude of individual jurisdictions , the outcome of political decision - making processes , including the actual laws and regulations enacted , the variables and trade - offs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes , and market conditions , including the responses of consumers to such changes . increasing attention to environmental , social , and governance ( esg ) matters impacts our company increasing attention to esg matters , including those related to climate change and sustainability , increasing societal , investor and legislative pressure on companies to address esg matters , and potential customer and consumer use of substitutes to chevron ’s products have resulted and may continue to result in changes to the portfolio and company activities , increased costs , reduced demand for our products , reduced profits , increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof , negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets , impaired participation in public discourse and debate by the company relating to mandatory and voluntary standards and regulations , and damage to our reputation . for example , increasing attention to esg matters , including climate change , may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional litigation and governmental investigations , or threats thereof , against the company . for instance , we have received investigative requests and demands from the u.s . congress for information relating to climate change , methane leak detection and repair , and other topics , and further requests and/or demands are possible . at this time , chevron can not predict the ultimate impact any congressional or other investigations may have on the company . information related to climate - change related litigation matters is included in note [XX] litigation under the heading “ climate change . ” some stakeholders , including but not limited to sovereign wealth , pension , and endowment funds , have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves . further , voluntary carbon - related and target - setting frameworks have developed , and continue to develop , that limit the ability of certain sectors , including the oil and gas sector , from participating , and may result in exclusion of the company ’s equity from being included as an investment option in portfolios . in addition , some stakeholders , including some of our investors , have divergent and evolving views on our esg - related strategies and priorities , vis - à - vis our lines of business , calling for focus on increased production of oil and gas products rather than new business lines and climate - related targets . these circumstances , among others , may result in pressure from activists on production ; unfavorable reputational impacts , including inaccurate perceptions or a misrepresentation of our actual esg policies , practices and performance ; diversion of management ’s attention and resources ; and proxy fights , among other material adverse impacts on our businesses . in addition , organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters , including climate change and climate - related risks ( including entities commonly referred to as “ raters and rankers ” ) . such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions . unfavorable esg ratings and investment community divestment initiatives , among other actions , may lead to negative investor sentiment toward chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries , which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital . additionally , evolving expectations on various esg matters , including biodiversity , waste and water , have increased , and may continue to increase , costs , require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment . our aspirations , targets and disclosures related to esg matters subject us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our reputation and stock price or result in other material adverse impacts to the company chevron has announced an aspiration to achieve net zero scope [X] and [X] emissions in upstream by [XXXX] . the company also has set nearer - term ghg emission - related targets for zero routine flaring , upstream carbon intensity , and portfolio carbon intensity . these and other aspirations , targets or objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations , and chevron may change them for various reasons , including evolving market conditions ; changes in our portfolio ; and financial , operational , regulatory , reputational , legal and other factors . our ability to achieve any aspiration , target or objective , including with respect to climate - related initiatives , our lower carbon strategy outlined in the management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , pages [XX] through [XX] , and any lower carbon new energy businesses , is subject to numerous risks , many of which are outside of our control . examples of such risks include : ( [X] ) sufficient and substantial advances in technology , including the # # table_start # # table_end continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non - carbon - based energy sources ; ( [X] ) the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities ; ( [X] ) the availability and acceptability of cost - effective , verifiable carbon credits ; ( [X] ) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards ; ( [X] ) evolving regulatory requirements , including changes to ipcc ’s global warming potentials , affecting esg standards or disclosures ; ( [X] ) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals ; ( [X] ) customers ’ and consumers ’ preferences and use of the company ’s products or substitute products ; and ( 8) actions taken by the company ’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations . the standards and regulations for tracking , reporting , marketing and advertising related to esg matters are relatively new , have not been harmonized and continue to evolve . our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period . our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for identifying , measuring , and reporting esg metrics , our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others , and such standards may change over time , including through non - public processes , any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals . in addition , chevron participates , along with other companies , institutes , universities , trade associations and other organizations , in various initiatives , campaigns , and other projects that express various ambitions , aspirations and goals related to climate change , emissions and energy transition . chevron ’s individual ambitions , future performance or policies may differ from the ambitions of such organizations or the individual ambitions of other participants in these various initiatives , campaigns , and other projects , and chevron may unilaterally change its individual ambitions , aspirations and goals . achievement of or efforts to achieve aspirations , targets , goals and objectives such as the foregoing and future internal climate - related initiatives has , and may continue to , increase costs , and , in addition , may require purchase of carbon credits , or limit or impact the company ’s business plans , operations and financial results , potentially resulting in the reduction to the economic end - of - life of certain assets , impairing the associated net book value , among other material adverse impacts . our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such aspirations , targets , goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce , or at all , could have a negative impact on the company ’s reputation , investor sentiment , ratings outcomes for evaluating the company ’s approach to esg matters , stock price , and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation , among other material adverse impacts . general risk factors changes in management ’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company ’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period in preparing the company ’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of [XXXX] , including its financial statements , chevron ’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date . these estimates and assumptions are based on management ’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty . materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known . areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property , plant and equipment and investments in affiliates ; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves ; accruals for estimated liabilities , including litigation reserves ; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans . changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions , such as changes in the company ’s business plans , general market conditions , the pace of energy transition , or changes in the company ’s outlook on commodity prices , could affect reported amounts of assets , liabilities or expenses ."

carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form [XX] - k. these risk factors are not the only risks we face . our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial . if any of these risks or other risks that are yet unknown or currently considered immaterial were to occur , our business , operating results and financial condition , as well as the value of an investment in our common stock , could be materially and adversely affected . risks related to our industry our operating results , our ability to execute on our strategy and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices or prolonged periods of low commodity prices . among the most significant factors impacting our revenues , operating results and future rate of growth are the sales prices for crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngl . these prices are tied to market prices that can fluctuate widely , and many of the factors influencing the prices are beyond our control . for example , over the course of [XXXX] , wti crude oil prices ranged from a low of $ [XX] per barrel in march to a high of $ [XX] per barrel in august . given the volatility in commodity price drivers and the worldwide political and economic environment , including potential economic slowdowns or recessions , unexpected shocks to supply and demand resulting from future global health crises such as those experienced in connection with the covid-19 pandemic or increased uncertainty generated by recent ( and potential future ) armed hostilities in various oil - producing regions around the globe , prices for crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls may continue to be volatile . prolonged periods of low commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues , operating income , cash flows and liquidity , and may also affect the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock and the amount of shares we elect to acquire as part of our share repurchase program and the timing of such acquisitions . lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can produce economically , thus adversely affecting our proved reserves and reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream fields . prolonged depressed prices may affect strategic decisions related to our operations , including decisions to reduce capital investments or curtail operated production . significant reductions in crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngl prices could also require us to reduce our capital expenditures , impair the carrying value of our assets or discontinue the classification of certain assets as proved reserves . although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments or estimated change to our unit - of - production rates at this time , our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result . unless we successfully develop resources , the scope of our business will decline , resulting in an adverse impact to our business . as we produce crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls from our existing portfolio , the amount of our remaining reserves declines . if we do not successfully replace the resources we produce with good prospects for future organic development or through acquisitions , our business will decline . in addition , our ability to successfully develop our reserves depends on our achievement of a number of operational and strategic objectives , some aspects of which are beyond our control , including navigating political and regulatory challenges to obtain and renew rights to develop and produce hydrocarbons ; reservoir optimization ; bringing long - lead time , capital intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule ; and efficiently and profitably operating mature properties . if we are not successful in developing the resources in our portfolio , our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected . the exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry . the exploration and production of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls is a highly competitive business . we compete with private , public and state - owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business , including to locate , acquire and develop new sources of supply and to produce crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls in an efficient , cost - effective manner . in addition , as the energy transition progresses , we anticipate the oil and gas industry will face additional competition from alternative fuels . we must also compete for the materials , equipment , services , employees and other personnel ( including geologists , geophysicists , engineers and other specialists ) necessary to conduct our business . if we are not successful in any facet of this competition , our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end our ability to successfully execute on our energy transition plans is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may be costly to achieve . in [XXXX] , we announced our paris - aligned climate risk framework , including an ambition to achieve net - zero operational emissions by [XXXX] . in [XXXX] , we published our plan for the net - zero energy transition ( the “ plan ” ) and continued to set increasingly ambitious targets around operational ghg emissions intensity and reducing methane emissions and flaring . our ability to achieve stated targets , goals and ambitions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties out of our control , government policies and markets , as well as potential regulations that may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans . such achievement also depends on the accelerated pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies , and the actual pace of development may be inadequate , or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient . furthermore , we are still in the planning stages , and the plan 's execution could be costly , may have unforeseen obstacles , may proceed at varying paces during the timeframe allotted for the plan and may be accomplished in a manner that we can not predict at this time . we may be required to purchase emission credits in the future , and there may be an insufficient supply of offsets to achieve our goals , or we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets . as advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions , we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise our strategies outlined in the plan . we may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end - of - field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets . even if we meet our goals , our efforts may be characterized as insufficient . in [XXXX] , we established our low - carbon technologies organization to identify and evaluate business opportunities that address end - use emissions and early - stage low - carbon technology opportunities that would leverage our existing expertise and adjacencies . our investments in these technologies may expose us to numerous financial , legal , operational , reputational and other risks . while we perform a thorough analysis on these investments , the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve , if any . furthermore , we may not be able to deploy such technologies at a commercial scale . the success of our low - carbon strategy will depend in part upon the cooperation of government agencies , the support of stakeholders , our ability to research and forecast potential investments , and our ability to apply our existing strengths and expertise to new technologies , projects and markets . estimates of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngl reserves are imprecise and may be subject to revision , and any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngl reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves . our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management ’s best estimates based on assumptions , as of a specified date , of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls . such volumes can not be directly measured , and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty . any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur impairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves . future reserve revisions could also result from changes in , among other things , governmental regulation and commodity prices . for more information on estimates used , see the "" critical accountin g estimates "" section of management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . our business may be adversely affected by price controls ; government - imposed limitations on production or exports of crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls ; or the unavailability of adequate gathering , processing , compression , transportation , and pipeline facilities and equipment for our production of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls . as discussed herein , our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations across numerous jurisdictions . from time to time , regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngl wells below actual production capacity . similarly , in response to increased domestic energy costs , circumstances determined to be in the economic interest of the country , or a declared national emergency , governments could restrict the export or import of our products which would adversely impact our business . because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation , we can not predict whether future restrictions on our business may be enacted or become applicable to us . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls that we produce also depends on the availability , proximity , and capacity of gathering , processing , compression , transportation and pipeline facilities and equipment , as well as any necessary diluents to prepare our crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls for transport . the facilities , equipment and diluents we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions , extreme weather events , permitting delays and other regulatory matters , mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions , many of which are beyond our control . in addition , in certain newer plays , the capacity of necessary facilities , equipment and diluents may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new wells , and construction and permitting delays , permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction , manufacture or other acquisition of new facilities and equipment . if any facilities , equipment or diluents , or any of the transportation methods and channels that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time , we may incur increased costs to transport our crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls for sale ; we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas or ngls or we may not be able to meet all the objectives in the plan , such as reducing routine flaring . our ability to manage risk or influence outcomes in joint ventures may be constrained . we conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which another joint venture partner is operator or we may not have majority control . in these cases , the economic , business , or legal interests or goals of the operator or the voting majority may be inconsistent with ours , and we may not be able to influence the decision making or outcomes to align with our interests or goals . failure by an operator or a voting majority , with whom we have a joint venture interest , to adequately manage the risks associated with any operations could have an adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and , in turn , our business and operations . our operations are subject to hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight . our operations are subject to a variety of hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight , such as the monitoring , prevention or mitigation of or protection from explosions , fires , product spills , severe weather , geological events , global health crises , such as epidemics and pandemics , labor disputes , geopolitical tensions , armed hostilities , terrorist or piracy attacks , sabotage , civil unrest or cyberattacks . our operations are subject to additional hazards concerning exposure to and potential release of pollutants and toxic substances , as well as other environmental hazards and risks . for example , offshore activities may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures , water depths and metocean conditions . all such hazards could result in loss of human life , significant property and equipment damage , environmental pollution , impairment of operations , substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation . our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond , or are perceived not to respond , in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity . countermeasures to address global health crises , epidemics or pandemics , including future outbreaks of covid-19 , may result in reduced demand for our products ; disruptions to our supply chain , the global economy or financial or commodity markets ; disruptions in our contractual arrangements with our service providers , suppliers and other counterparties ; failures by our suppliers , contract manufacturers , contractors , joint venture partners and external business partners , to meet their obligations to us ; reduced workforce productivity ; and voluntary or involuntary curtailments . further , our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses described above , and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future or may not be available . in addition , although we design and operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions , to the extent there are significant changes in the earth 's climate , such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets where we operate or the areas where our assets reside , we could incur increased expenses , our operations and supply chain could be adversely impacted and demand for our products could fall . any of these factors , or other cascading effects of such factors , could materially increase our costs ; negatively impact our revenues or ability to implement and advance the plan ; and damage our financial condition , results of operations , cash flows and liquidity position . the full extent and duration of any such impacts can not be predicted at this time because of the lack of certainty surrounding their sources , causes and outcomes . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end legal and regulatory risks we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations . our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment , which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations . for a description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations , see the “ contingencies — environmental ” , “ — climate change ” and "" — company re sponse to climate - related risks "" sections of management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to , among other things : • permits required in connection with exploration , drilling , production and other activities , including those issued by national , subnational , and local authorities ; • the discharge of pollutants into the environment ; • emissions into the atmosphere , such as nitrogen oxides , sulfur dioxide , mercury and ghg emissions , including methane ; • carbon taxes ; • the handling , use , storage , transportation , disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes ; • the dismantlement , abandonment and restoration of historic properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives ; and • exploration and production activities in certain areas , such as offshore environments , arctic fields , oil sands reservoirs and unconventional plays . we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital , operating and maintenance , and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations . in addition , to the extent these expenditures are assumed by a buyer as a result of a disposition , it may result in our incurring substantial costs if the buyer is unable to satisfy these obligations . any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with existing or future laws , regulations and other requirements could result in administrative or civil penalties , criminal fines , other enforcement actions or third - party litigation against us . to the extent these expenditures , as with all costs , are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products , our business , financial condition , results of operations and cash flows in future periods as well as our ability to implement and advance the plan could be adversely affected . existing and future laws , regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate change , such as limitations on ghg emissions , may impact or limit our business plans , result in significant expenditures , promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products . continuing political and societal attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national , regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions , such as cap and trade regimes , specific emission standards , carbon taxes , restrictive permitting , increased fuel efficiency standards , and incentives or mandates for renewable and alternative energy . although we may support the intent of legislative and regulatory measures aimed at addressing climate - related risks , the specifics of how and when they are enacted could result in a material adverse effect to our business , financial condition , results of operations and cash flows in future periods as well as our ability to implement and advance the plan . for example , in december [XXXX] , the epa published a final rule that revises the regulations governing , among other things , the emission of methane and volatile organic compounds from new oil and gas production facilities , and emission guidelines for states to use when revising clean air act implementation plans to limit methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities . the final rule could result in additional capital expenditures and compliance , operating and maintenance costs , any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations . additionally , in [XXXX] , the u.s . joined the international community at the 28th conference of the parties ( cop28 ) , where the u.s . and nearly [XXX] other countries , including most of the countries in which we operate , renewed their commitment to deliver on the aims of the [XXXX] paris agreement . cop28 included a decision on the world 's first ' global stocktake ' to ratchet up climate action before the end of the decade — including a goal to triple renewable energy capacity by [XXXX] — and for the first time its final agreement explicitly recommended "" transitioning away from fossil fuels in the energy system . "" the implementation of current agreements and regulatory measures , as well as any future agreements or measures addressing climate change and ghg emissions , may adversely increase our capital and operating expenses , # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end impact the demand for our products , impose taxes on our products or operations , or require us to purchase emission credits or reduce emissions of ghgs from our operations . for example , in august [XXXX] , the u.s . enacted the inflation reduction act of [XXXX] , which includes a charge on methane emissions from selected facilities in the oil and gas industry , including many of the facilities operated by conocophillips . as a result , we may incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance , operating , maintenance and remediation costs , any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations . for more information on legislation or precursors for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operations and a description of the company 's response , see the "" contingencies — climate change ” and "" — company response to climate -related risks "" sections of management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . broader investor and societal attention to and efforts to address global climate change may limit who can do business with us or our access to financial markets and could subject us to litigation . increasing attention to global climate change has also resulted in pressure from and upon stockholders , financial institutions and other financial market participants to potentially limit or discontinue investments , insurance and funding to oil and gas companies . for example , a significant number of financial institutions are now members of the glasgow financial alliance for net zero ( gfanz ) , thereby pledging to the goal of net zero by [XXXX] , as well as setting interim targets for [XXXX] or earlier . while they are not prohibited from doing business with oil and gas companies , gfanz members may self - impose limits . conversely , we also face pressure from some in the investment community and certain public interest groups to limit the focus on esg in our decision - making , arguing that esg considerations do not relate to financial outcomes . as public pressure continues to mount on the financial sector , our costs of capital may increase . furthermore , increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation , which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business . beginning in [XXXX] and continuing through [XXXX] , cities , counties , governments and other entities in several states / territories in the u.s . have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies , including conocophillips , seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts . additional lawsuits with similar allegations are expected to be filed . the amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal and factual issues involved in these cases are unprecedented . conocophillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless , and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuits . the ultimate outcome and impact to us can not be predicted with certainty , and we expect to incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future . we could also receive lawsuits alleging a failure or lack of diligence to meet our publicly stated esg goals , or alleging misrepresentation related to our esg activity . political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows . actions of the u.s . , state , local and foreign governments , through sanctions , tax and other legislation , executive orders and commercial restrictions , could reduce our operating profitability both in the u.s . and abroad . in certain locations , restrictions on our operations ; leasing restrictions ; special taxes or tax assessments ; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non - disclosure laws of other countries have been imposed or proposed by governments or certain interest groups . in addition , we may face regulatory changes in the u.s . including , but not limited to , the enactment of tax law changes that adversely affect the fossil fuel industry , new methane emissions standards , requirements restricting or prohibiting flaring and subsurface water disposal , more stringent environmental impact studies and reviews and policies inhibiting or curtailing lng exports . similar regulatory shifts , including attendant higher costs and market access constraints , may also occur in international jurisdictions in which we operate . hydraulic fracturing , an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations , has historically attracted political and regulatory scrutiny . a range of local , state , federal and national laws and regulations currently govern , constrain or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions . new or more stringent permitting , disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations , including subsurface water disposal , could result in increased costs , operating restrictions or operational delays or could limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources . in addition , certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives , contested lease sales and challenged project permits , for example , to restrict oil and natural gas development generally as well as specific projects , including the # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end willow project in alaska . in the event that ballot initiatives , local , state , or national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations , we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration , development or production activities . such compliance costs and delays , curtailments , limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business , prospects , results of operations , financial condition , liquidity and ability to implement and advance the plan . political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us . approximately [XX] percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the u.s . in [XXXX] , and [XX] percent of our proved reserves , as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , were located outside the u.s . we are subject to risks associated with our operations in foreign jurisdictions and international markets , including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas or ngl pricing and taxation ; other regulatory or economic developments ( including the macro effects of international trade policies and disputes ) ; disruptive geopolitical conditions , and international monetary and currency rate fluctuations . for example , in december [XXXX] , in response to higher energy prices resulting from the conflict between russia and ukraine , australia ’s parliament passed legislation setting a one - year price cap on natural gas . further legislation was introduced in [XXXX] that extends the price cap through to at least june [XXXX] , subject to further review and certain exemptions . restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy security and climate policies . the escalation of geopolitical tension in the middle east in late [XXXX] and early [XXXX] underscores the continued relevance of this consideration . in addition , some countries where we operate lack a fully independent judiciary system . this , coupled with changes in foreign law or policy , results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations to increased risks , including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities , such as expropriations . actions by host governments , such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the venezuelan government , have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future . in addition , the u.s . government has the authority to prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign jurisdictions or with certain parties . these restrictions and similar restrictions imposed by foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in , or gain access to , opportunities in various jurisdictions . diplomatic relations or policies between the u.s . government and one or more foreign jurisdictions may impair our ability to collect awards in legal actions against such foreign jurisdictions . changes in domestic and international policies and regulations may also restrict our ability to obtain or maintain licenses or permits necessary to operate in foreign jurisdictions , including those necessary for drilling and development of wells . similarly , the declaration of a “ climate emergency ” could result in actions to limit exports of our products and other restrictions . any of these actions could adversely affect our business or operating results , including our ability to implement and advance the plan . other risk factors facing our business or operations we may need additional capital in the future , and it may not be available on acceptable terms or at all . we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our business to fund our operations and strategy ; however , we have also relied from time to time on access to the capital markets for funding . there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all . in addition , although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plans , there can be no assurance we will be able to do so . our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plans , will be subject to a number of factors , including market conditions , our operating performance , investor sentiment , risks impacting financial institutions and the credit markets more broadly and financial institution policies regarding the oil and gas industry . if we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason , our business could be adversely affected . in addition , we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agencies based on a number of factors , including our financial strength and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally . we and other industry companies have had our ratings reduced in the past due to negative commodity price outlooks . these major rating agencies are now considering esg attributes when assessing credit profiles . while these assessments have limited impact today , they have the potential to pressure credit ratings over time . any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of , or defaults under our contracts with , third - parties with whom we do business . the operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries , including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry . these counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity , or for other reasons , including bankruptcy . market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties , or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations , may also exacerbate any operational difficulties or liquidity issues they are experiencing . any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligations under agreements we have made with third - parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations . in addition , our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances . we may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty , which could further adversely impact our results of operations . our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations . in december [XXXX] , we initiated a three - tier capital return program that consists of our ordinary dividend , share repurchases and a variable return of cash ( vroc ) . ordinary dividends are authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors , including : • cash available for distribution ; • our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations ; • our financial condition , especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties ; • the level of distributions paid by comparable companies ; • our operating expenses ; and • other factors our board of directors deems relevant . vroc distributions are also authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors , including : • the anticipated level of distributions required to meet our capital returns commitment ; • forward prices ; • the amount of cash we hold ; • total yield ; and • other factors our board of directors deems relevant . we expect to continue to pay a quarterly ordinary dividend to our stockholders . in addition , based on the current environment , we anticipate also paying a quarterly vroc to our shareholders ; however , the amount of dividends and vroc is variable and will depend upon the above factors , and our board of directors may determine not to pay a dividend or vroc in a quarter or may cease declaring a dividend or vroc at any time . since the inception of the three - tier return of capital program , the vroc has both increased and decreased across quarters , and it may continue to fluctuate in the future . additionally , as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , $ [XX.X] billion of repurchase authority remained of the $ [XX] billion share repurchase program our board of directors had authorized . our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period , and our decision to commence , discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our board of directors may consider when declaring dividends , among other factors . in the past we have suspended our share repurchase program in response to market downturns , including as a result of the oil market downturn that began in early [XXXX] , and we may do so again in the future . any downward revision in the amount of our ordinary dividend or vroc or the volume of shares we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end there are substantial risks with any acquisitions or divestitures we have completed or that we may choose to undertake . we regularly review our portfolio and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore assets or businesses . we may not be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms , on a timely basis , or at all . even if we do complete such transactions , our cash flow from operations may be adversely impacted or otherwise the transactions may not result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks , including , but not limited to ( i ) the failure of the acquired assets or businesses to meet or exceed expected returns , including risk of impairment ; ( ii ) the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions ; and ( iii ) the discovery of unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections are inadequate or we lack insurance or indemnities , including environmental liabilities , or with regard to divested assets or businesses , claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification . in addition , we may face difficulties in integrating the operations , technologies , products and personnel of any acquired assets or businesses . our technologies , systems and networks are subject to cybersecurity threats . our business is faced with growing cybersecurity threats as we increasingly rely on digital technologies across our business . cybersecurity risks to our business , including our suppliers , third - party service providers , contractors , joint venture partners and external business partners , include but are not limited to : • unauthorized access to , or control of or disclosure of sensitive information about our business and our employees ; • compromise of our data or systems , including corruption , sabotage , encryption or acts that otherwise render our data or systems unusable ( or those of third - parties with whom we do business , including third - party cloud and information technology ( it ) service providers ) ; • theft or manipulation of our proprietary information ; • ransom ; • extortion ; • threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure ; and • cyber terrorism . in addition , we have exposure to cybersecurity risks where our data and proprietary information are collected , hosted , and/or processed by third - party cloud and service providers . our risks may be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cybersecurity incident or understand the full extent of such incident notwithstanding our risk management processes and controls . we face risks associated with new and ever - increasing phishing techniques , hidden malware , as well as risks associated with electronic data proliferation and technology digitization . we also face increased risk with the increased sophistication of generative artificial intelligence capabilities , which may improve or expand the existing capabilities of cybercriminals described above in a manner we can not predict at this time . our increasing reliance on it in our production , distribution and marketing systems may allow cybersecurity threats to disrupt our oil and gas operations , both domestically and abroad . if our data , it , operational technology ( ot ) , including industrial control and supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) systems were to be breached , damaged or disrupted due to a cybersecurity incident or cyber - attack ( directly , indirectly through third - parties or through the it networks , servers , software , or infrastructure on which they rely ) , we could be subject to serious negative consequences . these consequences could include physical damage to production , distribution or storage assets ; delay or prevention of delivery to markets ; disruption or prevention of accurate accounting for production and settlement of transactions ; negative impacts on public health , safety , the environment , economic security , or national security ; financial impacts ; business interruption ; reputational damage ; loss of employee , supplier , contractor , partner and/or public trust ; reimbursement or other costs ; increased compliance costs ; regulatory investigations ; litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines ; penalties or other external intervention . although we have business continuity plans in place , our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our business . further , our ability to insure against cybersecurity risks may be limited by the availability and increasing expense of sufficient coverage . for additional information regarding our cybersecurity risk management , strategy and governance , see i tem 1c . cyber s ecurity . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end"

related matters , non - financial reporting and diligence , labor and employment , trade , taxation and data privacy and protection , including the european union ’s general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) and similar regulations in states within the united states and in countries around the world . the company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations that apply to us around the globe ; and we have made , and plan to continue making , necessary expenditures for compliance with these laws and regulations . we also expect that our many suppliers , consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance , and we have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships , though they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and governance . we do not expect that the company ’s expenditures for compliance with current government regulations , including current environmental regulations , will have a material effect on our total capital expenditures , earnings or competitive position in fiscal year [XXXX] as compared to prior periods . human capital . our employees are a key source of competitive advantage . their actions , guided by our purpose , values and principles ( pvps ) , are critical to the long - term success of our business . we aim to retain our talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits , strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all . our board of directors , through the compensation and leadership development committee ( c&ld committee ) , provides oversight of the company ’s policies and strategy relating to talent including diversity , equality and inclusion as well as the company ’s compensation principles and practices . the c&ld committee also evaluates and approves the company ’s compensation plans , policies and programs applicable to our senior executives . employees as of june [XX] , [XXXX] , the company had approximately [XXX,XXX] employees , an increase of [X] % versus the prior year due primarily to business growth . the total number of employees is an estimate of total company employees excluding interns , co - ops , contractors and employees of joint ventures .

based plastic in packaging , increasing the recyclability or reusability of packaging , responsible sourcing of key forest - based commodities , improving efficiency of water usage in our operations and driving a global portfolio of water restoration projects to address water scarcity . we use the standards and guidelines of the global reporting initiative , sustainability accounting standards board ( sasb ) industry specific standards and the task force on climate - related financial disclosures ( tcfd ) to inform our sustainability and related disclosures included in this annual report , our proxy statement and our sustainability reports . the “ materiality ” thresholds in those standards and guidelines may differ from the concept of “ materiality ” for purposes of the federal securities laws and disclosures required by the commission ’s rules in this annual report . references to our sustainability reports and website are for informational purposes only and neither the sustainability reports nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this annual report on form [XX] - k. additional detailed information on our sustainability efforts can be found on our website at","item 1a . risk factors . we discuss our expectations regarding future performance , events and outcomes , such as our business outlook and objectives in this form [XX] - k , as well as in our quarterly and annual reports , current reports on form [X] - k , press releases and other written and oral communications . all statements , except for historical and present factual information , are “ forward - looking statements ” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made , which may become outdated or incomplete . we assume no obligation to update any forward - looking statements as a result of new information , future events or other factors , except to the extent required by law . forward - looking statements are inherently uncertain , and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations . the following discussion of “ risk factors ” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business , operations , financial position or future financial performance . this information should be read in conjunction with management 's discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report . the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations . these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward - looking statements and from historical trends , perhaps materially . macroeconomic conditions and related financial risks our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of having significant operations and sales in international markets , including foreign currency fluctuations , currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility . we are a global company , with operations in approximately [XX] countries and products sold in approximately [XXX] countries and territories around the world . we hold assets , incur liabilities , generate sales and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s . dollar , and our operations outside the u.s . generate more than [XX] % of our annual net sales . fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the u.s . dollar value of sales , earnings and cash flows we receive from non - u.s . markets , increase our supply costs ( as measured in u.s . dollars ) in those markets , negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition . further , we have a significant amount of foreign currency debt and derivatives as part of our capital markets activities . the maturity cash outflows of these instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates ( particularly the euro ) , which could adversely impact our overall cash flows . moreover , discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries , including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements , could adversely affect our results . see also the results of operations and cash flow , financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes . we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange , import authorization , pricing or other controls or restrictions , such as egypt , argentina and pakistan . our results of operations , financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions , continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas , or if new or increased tariffs , quotas , exchange or price controls , trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business . additionally , our business , operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected ( including by the need to de - consolidate or even exit certain businesses in particular countries ) by geopolitical conflicts , political volatility , trade controls , labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions . this could include political instability , upheaval or acts of war ( such as the russia - ukraine war ) and the related government and other entity responses , broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments , particularly in emerging markets . uncertain economic or social conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship , which could adversely impact our business . our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local , regional or global economic or social disruptions . these disruptions have included and may in the future include : a slow - down , [X] the procter & gamble company recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy ; reduced market growth rates ; tighter credit markets for our suppliers , vendors or customers ; a significant shift in government policies ; significant social unrest ; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions ; potential negative consumer sentiment toward non - local products or sources ; or the inability to conduct day - to - day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers , vendors and suppliers . additionally , these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers , distributors , contractors or other third - party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they can not overcome , resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need , in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected . customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles . in addition , if we are unable to generate sufficient sales , income and cash flow , it could affect the company ’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments . disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity . a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us , which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital . in addition , we rely on top - tier banking partners in key markets around the world , who themselves face economic , societal , political and other risks , for access to credit and to facilitate collection , payment and supply chain finance programs . a disruption to one or more of these top - tier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our customers and vendors . changing political and geopolitical conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results . changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture , sell or distribute our products , as well as changing geopolitical conditions , may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results . results of elections , referendums , sanctions or other political processes and pressures in certain markets in which our products are manufactured , sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies , laws and regulations may change , including with respect to sanctions , taxes , tariffs , import and export controls and the general movement of goods , materials , services , capital , data and people between countries . the potential implications of such uncertainty , which include , among others , exchange rate fluctuations , new or increased tariffs , trade barriers and market contraction , could adversely affect the company ’s results of operations and cash flows . the company operates a global business with sales , manufacturing , distribution and research and development organizations globally that contribute to our overall growth . if geopolitical tensions and trade controls were to increase or disrupt our business in markets where we have significant sales or operations , including disruptions due to governmental responses to such conflicts ( such as the imposition of sanctions , retaliatory tariffs , increased business licensing requirements or limitations on profits ) , such disruptions could adversely impact our business , financial condition , results of operations and cash flows . the war between russia and ukraine has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and financial results . the war between russia and ukraine has negatively impacted , and the situation it generates may continue to negatively impact , our operations . beginning in march [XXXX] , the company reduced its product portfolio , discontinued new capital investments and suspended media , advertising and promotional activity in russia . future impacts to the company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will evolve . within ukraine , there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities , our distribution centers or those of our customers . we may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers . within russia , we may reduce further or discontinue our operations due to sanctions and export controls and counter - sanctions , monetary , currency or payment controls , restrictions on access to financial institutions , supply and transportation challenges or other circumstances and considerations . ultimately , these could result in loss of assets or impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write - downs of other operating assets and working capital . the war between russia and ukraine could also amplify or affect the other risk factors set forth in this part i , item 1a , including , but not limited to , foreign exchange volatility , disruptions to the financial and credit markets , energy supply and supply chain disruptions , increased risks of an information security or operational technology incident , cost fluctuations and commodity cost increases and increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local laws and regulations . the occurrence of any of these risks , combined with the increased impact from the war between russia and ukraine , could adversely impact our business and financial results . more broadly , there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales , earnings and cash flows should the situation worsen , including , among other potential impacts , economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures , energy and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of europe . business operations risks our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain . our ability to meet our customers ’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements , including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant the procter & gamble company [X] arrangements . the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements , including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies , loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites , discontinuity or disruptions in our internal information and data systems or those of our suppliers , cybersecurity incidents , inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials ( including water , recycled materials and materials that meet our labor standards ) , significant changes in trade policy , natural disasters , increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise , acts of war or terrorism , disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control , have at times interrupted and could , in the future , interrupt product supply and , if not effectively managed and remedied , could have an adverse impact on our business , financial condition , results of operations or cash flows . our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results . our costs are subject to fluctuations , particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities ( including certain petroleum - derived materials like resins and paper - based materials like pulp ) and raw and packaging materials and the costs of labor , transportation ( including trucks and containers ) , energy , pension and healthcare . inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs . therefore , our business results depend , in part , on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions , cost saving projects and sourcing decisions , while maintaining and improving margins and market share . failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows . the ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels . the consumer products industry is highly competitive . across all of our categories , we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors . as a result , we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate , which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins . to address these challenges , we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends , including pricing , promotional incentives , product delivery windows and trade terms . in addition , evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics , which , for example , may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online , ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels . failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models , particularly e - commerce and mobile or social commerce applications , could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows . a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business . we sell most of our products via retail customers , which include mass merchandisers , e - commerce ( including social commerce ) channels , grocery stores , membership club stores , drug stores , department stores , distributors , wholesalers , specialty beauty stores ( including airport duty - free stores ) , high - frequency stores , pharmacies , electronics stores and professional channels . our success depends on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers , which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets . continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business , and our business performance could suffer if we can not reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles . our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers , private label brands and generic non - branded products or for other reasons , significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption . if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly , it could have a material impact on our financial results . the company 's reputation , and the reputation of our brands , form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies , including consumers , customers and suppliers . the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business . many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands . the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand 's image or its ability to attract consumers . our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall , product - related litigation , defects or impurities in our products , product misuse , changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients , negative perceptions of packaging ( such as plastic and other petroleum - based materials ) , lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts , concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices , privacy lapses or data breaches , allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products . additionally , negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company . if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues , including concerns about safety , quality , ingredients , efficacy , environmental or social impacts or similar matters , sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted , and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer . our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation , including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility , strong communities , equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability . while the company has many programs and [X] the procter & gamble company initiatives to further these goals , our ability to achieve these goals is impacted in part by the actions and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities , suppliers , vendors and customers . consumer or broader stakeholder perceptions of these programs and initiatives widely vary and could adversely affect our business . if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity , the company 's reputation and results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted . we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business , which creates additional risk . due to the scale and scope of our business , we must rely on relationships with third parties , including our suppliers , contract manufacturers , distributors , contractors , commercial banks , joint venture partners and external business partners , for certain functions . if we are unable to effectively manage our third - party relationships and the agreements under which our third - party partners operate , our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted . further , failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results . additionally , while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships , they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations , governance and compliance , thereby potentially increasing our financial , legal , reputational and operational risk . a significant information security or operational technology incident , including a cybersecurity breach , or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems , networks , hardware , processes and/or associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation . we rely extensively on information and operational technology ( it / ot ) systems , networks and services , including internet and intranet sites , data hosting and processing facilities and technologies , physical security systems and other hardware , software and technical applications and platforms , many of which are managed , hosted , provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors , to assist in conducting our business . the various uses of these it / ot systems , networks and services include , but are not limited to : • ordering and managing materials from suppliers ; • converting materials to finished products ; • shipping products to customers ; • marketing and selling products to consumers ; • collecting , transferring , storing and/or processing customer , consumer , employee , vendor , investor and other stakeholder information and personal data , including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations , such as citizens of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) , residents of california covered by the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ) , citizens of china covered by the personal information protection law ( pipl ) and citizens of brazil covered by the general personal data protection law ( lgpd ) ; • summarizing and reporting results of operations , including financial reporting ; • managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms ; • hosting , processing and sharing , as appropriate , confidential and proprietary research , business plans and financial information ; • collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications ; • complying with regulatory , legal and tax requirements ; • providing data security ; and • handling other processes necessary to manage our business . numerous and evolving information security threats , including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats , pose a risk to the security of our services , systems , networks and supply chain , as well as to the confidentiality , availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations . in addition , because the techniques , tools and tactics used in cyber - attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time , we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack . our it / ot databases and systems and our third - party providers ’ databases and systems have been , and will likely continue to be , subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes , ransomware , unauthorized access attempts , denial of service attacks , phishing , social engineering , hacking and other cyber - attacks . such attacks may originate from outside parties , hackers , criminal organizations or other threat actors , including nation states . in addition , insider actors - malicious or otherwise - could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential data leakage . we can not guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third - party providers will prevent material breaches , operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third - party providers ’ it / ot databases or systems . a breach of our data security systems or failure of our it / ot databases and systems may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results . if the it / ot systems , networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations , or if we or one of our third - party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations , or inadvertent disclosure of , lack of integrity of , or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information , the procter & gamble company [X] including personal information , due to any number of causes , including catastrophic events , natural disasters , power outages , computer and telecommunications failures , improper data handling , viruses , phishing attempts , cyber - attacks , malware and ransomware attacks , security breaches , security incidents or employee error or malfeasance , and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis , we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and be exposed to reputational , competitive , operational , financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action . if our critical it systems or back - up systems or those of our third - party vendors are damaged or cease to function properly , we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them . in addition , if a ransomware attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs , either internally or at our third - party technology service providers , we could be prevented from accessing our data or systems , which may cause interruptions or delays in our business operations , cause us to incur remediation costs , subject us to demands to pay a ransom or damage our reputation . in addition , such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or stakeholder information , including personal information , and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated information belonging to us or to our partners , our employees , customers and suppliers . additionally , we could be exposed to potential liability , litigation , governmental inquiries , investigations or regulatory enforcement actions ; and we could be subject to payment of fines or other penalties , legal claims by our suppliers , customers or employees and significant remediation costs . periodically , we also upgrade our it / ot systems or adopt new technologies . if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures , it could affect our ability to order materials , make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues . the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows . we must successfully manage the demand , supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of any future disease outbreak , including epidemics , pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns . our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak , epidemic , pandemic or similar widespread public health concern . these impacts may include , but are not limited to : • significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products , which may be caused by , among other things : the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness , quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship , shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products , or stockpiling or similar pantry - loading activity . if prolonged , such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows ; or • significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture , sell or distribute our products , including quarantines , import / export restrictions , price controls , or governmental or regulatory actions , closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities , restrict our employees ’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions , or otherwise prevent our third - party partners , suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations . despite efforts to manage and remedy these impacts , their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control , including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third - party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects . business strategy & organizational risks our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product , marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation , evolving digital marketing and selling platforms and changing consumer habits . we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products . achieving our business results depends , in part , on successfully developing , introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes . the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends , to obtain , maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and to continue to deliver efficient and effective marketing across evolving media and mobile platforms with dynamic and increasingly more restrictive privacy requirements . we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by , and intellectual property rights granted to , competitors , customers and vendors . failure to continually innovate , improve and respond to competitive moves , platform evolution and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition , results of operations or cash flows . we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition , joint venture and divestiture activities . as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands , our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition , joint venture and divestiture activities . we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities , while at the same time delivering against our business objectives . specifically , our financial results have been , and in the future could be , adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures . our results of operations and cash flows have been , and in the future could also be , impacted by acquisitions or joint [X] the procter & gamble company venture activities , if : [X] ) changes in the cash flows or other market - based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value , or [X] ) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures , including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges , which could also result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets . our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change , including attracting and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning . our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings , including staffing adjustments and employee departures . failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings , while continuing to invest in business growth , could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows . additionally , successfully executing organizational change , management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success . factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale , our reputation , competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals . our success depends on identifying , developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business . this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans . legal & regulatory risks we must successfully manage compliance with current and expanding laws and regulations , as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the u.s . and abroad . our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business , including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property , product liability , product composition or formulation , packaging content or corporate responsibility for packaging and product disposal , marketing , antitrust and competition , privacy , data protection , environmental ( including increasing focus on the climate , water and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies ' operations and products ) , employment , healthcare , anti - bribery and anti - corruption ( including interactions with health care professionals and government officials as well as corresponding internal controls and record - keeping requirements ) , trade ( including tariffs , sanctions and export controls ) , tax , accounting and financial reporting or other matters . in addition , increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental , social and governance ( esg ) matters , including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting , diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change , waste production , water usage , human capital , labor and risk oversight , could expand the nature , scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control , assess and report . these and other rapidly changing laws , regulations , policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies , create challenges for the company , may alter the environment in which we do business , may increase the ongoing costs and complexities of compliance including by requiring investments in technology or other compliance systems , and may ultimately result in the need to cease manufacturing , sales or other business activities in certain jurisdictions , which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows . if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws , regulations , policies and related interpretations , it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results . additionally , we are currently , and in the future may be , subject to a number of inquiries , investigations , claims , proceedings and requests for information from governmental agencies or private parties , the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business . failure to successfully manage these new or pending regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition , results of operations and cash flows . furthermore , if new or pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date , that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position . changes in applicable tax laws and regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results . the company is subject to taxation in the u.s . and numerous foreign jurisdictions . changes in the various tax laws can and do occur . for example , in december [XXXX] , the u.s . government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act ( the u.s . tax act ) . the changes included in the u.s . tax act were broad and complex . under the current u.s . presidential administration , comprehensive federal income tax reform has been proposed , including an increase in the u.s . federal corporate income tax rate , elimination of certain investment incentives and an increase in u.s . taxation of non - u.s . earnings . while these proposals are controversial , likely to change during the legislative process and may prove difficult to enact as proposed in the current closely divided u.s . congress , their impact could nonetheless be significant . additionally , longstanding international tax norms that determine each country ’s jurisdiction to tax cross - border international trade are subject to potential evolution . an outgrowth of the original base erosion and profit shifting ( beps ) project is a project undertaken by the approximately [XXX] member countries of the expanded organisation for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) inclusive framework focused on "" addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy . "" the breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and , as proposed , would likely impact a large portion of multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights in market countries and establishing a global minimum tax . in december [XXXX] , the european union ( eu ) approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate a [XX] % global minimum tax into their respective domestic laws effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december [XX] , [XXXX] . in the procter & gamble company [X] addition , several non - eu countries have recently proposed and/or adopted legislation consistent with the global minimum tax framework . important details of these minimum tax developments are still to be determined and , in some cases , enactment and timing remain uncertain . while it is too early to assess the overall impact of these potential changes , as these and other tax laws and related regulations are revised , enacted and implemented , our financial condition , results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted . furthermore , we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities . while we believe our tax positions will be sustained , the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation , including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal [XXXX] beauty brands transaction with coty , may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements , which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows ."

“ trademark sprite ” includes sprite , sprite zero sugar , etc . ; and “ trademark simply ” includes simply orange , simply apple , simply grapefruit , etc . ) . our company operates in two lines of business : concentrate operations and finished product operations . our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates , sometimes referred to as “ beverage bases , ” syrups , including fountain syrups , and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations ( to which we typically refer as our “ bottlers ” or our “ bottling partners ” ) . our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners ( depending on the product ) , or combine syrups with still or sparkling water , to produce finished beverages . the finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers , such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles , bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or , in some cases , through wholesalers or other bottlers . in addition , outside the united states , our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups , using our concentrates , which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption , or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers . our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our global ventures operating segment . our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers , or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers . generally , finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations . these operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations , which are included in our bottling investments operating segment . in certain markets , the company also operates non - bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the company ’s bottling partners . these operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our global ventures operating segment . additionally , we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by costa limited ( “ costa ” ) . these sales are included in our global ventures operating segment . in the united states , we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers , who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption , or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers . these fountain syrup sales are included in our north america operating segment . for information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations , refer to the heading “ our business — general ” set forth in part ii , “ item [X] . management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” of this report . for information regarding how we measure the volume of company beverage products sold by the company and our bottling partners ( “ coca - cola system ” ) , refer to the heading “ operations review — beverage volume ” set forth in part ii , “ item [X] . management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” of this report . we own and market numerous valuable beverage brands , including the following : • sparkling soft drinks : coca - cola , diet coke / coca - cola light , coca - cola zero sugar , fanta , fresca , schweppes [X] , sprite and thums up ; • water , sports , coffee and tea : aquarius , ayataka , bodyarmor , ciel , costa , dasani , doğadan , fuze tea , georgia , glacéau smartwater , glacéau vitaminwater , gold peak , ice dew , i lohas , powerade and topo chico ; and • juice , value - added dairy and plant - based beverages : ades , del valle , fairlife , innocent , minute maid , minute maid pulpy and simply . [X] schweppes is owned by the company in certain countries other than the united states . the company has also directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the united states . in the united states , the company has established a wholly owned , indirect , firewalled subsidiary , which authorizes alcohol - licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain company beverage bases . the company ’s approach in alcohol focuses on three segments of alcohol ready - to - drink beverages : hard seltzers ( e.g. , topo chico hard seltzer ) , hard alternatives ( e.g. , lemon - dou ) and pre - mixed cocktails ( e.g. , jack daniel ’s & coca - cola ) . in addition to the beverage brands we own , we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses , joint ventures and strategic relationships . for example , certain coca - cola system bottlers distribute certain brands of monster beverage corporation ( “ monster ” ) , primarily monster energy , in designated territories in the united states , canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the company and monster and related distribution agreements between monster and coca - cola system bottlers . consumer demand determines the optimal menu of company product offerings . consumer demand can vary from one market to another and can change over time within a single market . our company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of brands , products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market . distribution system we make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than [XXX] countries and territories through our network of independent bottling partners , distributors , wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations . consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the company at a rate of [X.X] billion servings each day . our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us capture growth by manufacturing , distributing and selling existing , enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world . the coca - cola system sold [XX.X] billion and [XX.X] billion unit cases of our products in [XXXX] and [XXXX] , respectively . sparkling soft drinks represented [XX] % of our worldwide unit case volume in both [XXXX] and [XXXX] . trademark coca - cola accounted for [XX] % and [XX] % of our worldwide unit case volume in [XXXX] and [XXXX] , respectively . in [XXXX] , unit case volume in the united states represented [XX] % of the company ’s worldwide unit case volume . of the u.s . unit case volume , [XX] % was attributable to sparkling soft drinks . trademark coca - cola accounted for [XX] % of u.s . unit case volume . unit case volume outside the united states represented [XX] % of the company ’s worldwide unit case volume in [XXXX] . the countries outside the united states in which our unit case volumes were the largest were mexico , china , brazil and india , which together accounted for [XX] % of our worldwide unit case volume . of the non - u.s . unit case volume , [XX] % was attributable to sparkling soft drinks . trademark coca - cola accounted for [XX] % of non - u.s . unit case volume . our five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in [XXXX] were as follows : • coca - cola femsa , s.a.b . de c.v . ( “ coca - cola femsa ” ) , which has bottling and distribution operations in mexico ( a substantial part of central mexico , as well as southeast and northeast mexico ) , guatemala , colombia ( most of the country ) , nicaragua , costa rica , panama , venezuela , uruguay , brazil ( a major part of the states of são paulo and minas gerais ; the states of mato grosso do sul , paraná , rio grande do sul , and santa catarina ; and part of the states of goiás and rio de janeiro ) , and argentina ( federal capital of buenos aires and surrounding areas ) ; • coca - cola europacific partners plc ( “ ccep ” ) , which has bottling and distribution operations in andorra , australia , belgium , fiji , continental france , germany , great britain , iceland , indonesia , luxembourg , monaco , the netherlands , new zealand , norway , papua new guinea , portugal , samoa , spain and sweden ; • coca - cola hbc ag ( “ coca - cola hellenic ” ) , which has bottling and distribution operations in armenia , austria , belarus , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , cyprus , the czech republic , egypt , estonia , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , moldova , montenegro , nigeria , north macedonia , northern ireland , poland , republic of ireland , romania , russia , serbia , slovakia , slovenia , switzerland and ukraine ; • arca continental , s.a.b . de c.v . , which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western mexico , northern argentina , ecuador , peru , and the state of texas and part of the states of new mexico , oklahoma and arkansas in the united states ; and • swire coca - cola limited , which has bottling and distribution operations in [XX] provinces and the shanghai municipality in mainland china , hong kong , taiwan , cambodia , vietnam and territories in [XX] states in the western united states . in [XXXX] , these five bottling partners combined represented [XX] % of our total worldwide unit case volume . being a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers . our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents . bottler ’s agreements we have separate contracts , to which we generally refer as “ bottler ’s agreements , ” with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us . subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations , the bottler ’s agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare , package , distribute and sell company trademark beverages in authorized containers in ( but , subject to applicable local law , generally only in ) an identified territory . the bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated company trademark beverages from the company or company - authorized suppliers . we typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing , or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute , the designated company trademark beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers . however , we typically reserve for us or our designee the right ( [X] ) to prepare and package such company trademark beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory ; ( [X] ) to prepare , package , distribute and sell such company trademark beverages in the territory in any other manner or form ( territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law ) ; and ( [X] ) to handle certain key accounts ( accounts that cover multiple territories ) . while under most of our bottler ’s agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers , as a practical matter , our company ’s ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject , both outside and within the united states , to competitive market conditions . however , in an effort to allow our company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value , aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers ’ always changing needs and tastes , we have implemented an incidence - based concentrate pricing model in most markets . under this model , the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors , including , but not limited to , bottler pricing , the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold , and package mix . as further discussed below , our bottler ’s agreements for territories outside the united states differ in some respects from our bottler ’s agreements for territories within the united states . bottler ’s agreements outside the united states bottler ’s agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the united states generally are of stated duration , subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals . generally , these bottler ’s agreements are subject to termination by the company following the occurrence of certain designated events , including defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or control of the bottlers . most of the bottler ’s agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the united states authorize the bottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups , usually on a nonexclusive basis . in certain parts of the world outside the united states , we have not granted comprehensive beverage production and distribution rights to the bottlers . in such instances , we have authorized certain bottlers to ( [X] ) prepare and package company trademark beverages for sale to other bottlers or ( [X] ) purchase company trademark beverages from other bottlers for sale and distribution throughout their respective designated territories , often on a nonexclusive basis . bottler ’s agreements within the united states in the united states , most bottlers operate under a contract to which we generally refer as a “ comprehensive beverage agreement ” ( “ cba ” ) that is of stated duration , subject in most cases to renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal rights of the company . a small number of bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler ’s agreements with no stated expiration date for trademark coca - cola beverages and other cola - flavored company trademark beverages . in all instances , the bottler ’s agreements in the united states are subject to termination by the company for nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract . certain u.s . bottlers have been granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution , promotion , marketing and sale of company - owned and licensed beverage brands ( as defined by the cbas ) . we refer to these bottlers as “ expanding participating bottlers ” or “ epbs . ” epbs operate under cbas ( “ epb cbas ” ) under which the company generally retained the rights to produce the applicable beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements , and such bottlers purchase from the company ( or from company - authorized manufacturing bottlers ) substantially all of the finished beverage products needed in order to service the customers in these territories . each epb cba has a term of [XX] years and is renewable , in most cases by the bottler , and in some cases by the company , indefinitely for successive additional terms of [XX] years each and includes additional requirements that provide for , among other things , a binding national governance model , mandatory incidence pricing and certain core performance requirements . the company has also entered into manufacturing agreements that authorize certain epbs that have executed epb cbas to manufacture certain beverage products for their own account and for supply to other bottlers . in addition , certain u.s . bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights , which we refer to as “ participating bottlers , ” converted their legacy bottler ’s agreements to cbas , to which we refer as “ participating bottler cbas , ” each of which has a term of [XX] years , is renewable by the bottler indefinitely for successive additional terms of [XX] years each , and is substantially similar in most material respects to the epb cbas , including with respect to requirements for a binding national governance model and mandatory incidence pricing , but includes core performance requirements that vary in certain respects from those in the epb cbas . those bottlers that have not signed cbas continue to operate under legacy bottler ’s agreements that include pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price for trademark coca - cola beverages and other cola - flavored company trademark beverages . this baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the company , up to a maximum indexed ceiling price , and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices , as applicable . the u.s . unit case volume prepared , packaged , sold and distributed under these legacy bottler ’s agreements is not material . under the terms of the bottler ’s agreements , bottlers in the united states generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups . rather , the company manufactures and sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers ( including certain authorized bottlers ) and some fountain retailers . these wholesalers in turn sell the syrups , or deliver them on our behalf , to restaurants and other retailers . promotional and marketing programs in addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities , we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers . in most cases , we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements , even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler ’s agreements between our company and the bottlers . also , on a discretionary basis in most cases , our company may develop and introduce new products , packages and equipment to assist the bottlers . likewise , in many instances , we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle / can retailers , typically pursuant to marketing agreements . investments in bottling operations most of our branded beverage products are prepared , packaged , distributed and sold by independent bottling partners . however , from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation , often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance . owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources ; help focus the bottler ’s sales and marketing programs ; assist in the development of the bottler ’s business and information systems ; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler . in line with our long - term bottling strategy , we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation , typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve coca - cola system efficiency . when we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment , our company continues to participate in the bottler ’s results of operations through our share of the equity method investee ’s earnings or losses . in addition , from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the coca - cola system ’s production , marketing , sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses . these investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume , net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level , which in turn generate increased sales for our company ’s concentrate operations . when our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler ’s operating and financial policies , we account for the investment under the equity method . seasonality sales of our ready - to - drink beverages are somewhat seasonal , with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes . the volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions . competition the commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies , ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established . these include companies that , like our company , compete globally in multiple geographic areas , as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation . competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks ; water products , including flavored and enhanced waters ; juices , juice drinks and nectars ; dilutables ( including syrups and powders ) ; coffees ; teas ; energy drinks ; sports drinks ; milk and other dairy - based drinks ; plant - based beverages ; functional beverages , including vitamin - based products and relaxation beverages ; and various other nonalcoholic beverages . these competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready - to - drink and non - ready - to - drink form . the company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the united states . in the united states , the company has established a wholly owned , indirect , firewalled subsidiary , which authorizes alcohol - licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain company beverage bases . competitive products include all alcohol ready - to - drink beverages containing various alcohol bases . in many of the countries in which we do business , pepsico , inc . is a primary competitor . other significant competitors include , but are not limited to , nestlé s.a . , keurig dr pepper inc . , danone s.a . , suntory beverage & food limited , ab inbev , kirin holdings , heineken n.v . , diageo and red bull gmbh . we also compete against numerous regional and local companies and , increasingly , against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e - commerce retailers and other e - commerce platforms . in addition , in some markets , we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private - label beverage brands . competitive factors impacting our business include , but are not limited to , pricing , advertising , sales promotion programs , in - store displays and point - of - sale marketing , digital marketing , product and ingredient innovation , increased efficiency in production techniques , the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment , contracting with marketing assets ( theaters , sports arenas , universities , etc . ) , and brand and trademark development and protection . our competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty ; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of company products ; sophisticated marketing capabilities ; and a talented group of dedicated employees . our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions ; in many countries , a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among company products , products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers ’ own store or private - label beverage brands ; new industry entrants ; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape . raw materials we and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business , including high fructose corn syrup ( “ hfcs ” ) , sucrose , aspartame , acesulfame potassium , sucralose , saccharin , cyclamate , steviol glycosides , ascorbic acid , citric acid , phosphoric acid , caffeine and caramel color ; other raw materials such as orange and other fruit juice and juice concentrates , milk , and coffee ; packaging materials such as polyethylene terephthalate ( “ pet ” ) , bio - based pet and recycled pet for bottles ; and aluminum cans , glass bottles and other containers . water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products . while historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties , water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world , and our company recognizes water availability , quality and sustainability , for both our operations and also the communities where we operate , as one of the key challenges facing our business . in addition to water , the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non - nutritive sweeteners . in the united states , the principal nutritive sweetener is hfcs , which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar . hfcs is available from numerous domestic sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price . adverse weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived . for example , drought conditions in certain parts of the united states or in other major corn - producing areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn , which in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for hfcs . the principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the united states is sucrose ( i.e. , table sugar ) , which is also available from numerous sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price . our company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners . in the united states , we purchase hfcs to meet our and our bottlers ’ requirements with the assistance of coca - cola bottlers ’ sales & services company llc ( “ ccbss ” ) . ccbss is a limited liability company that is owned by authorized coca - cola bottlers doing business in the united states and canada . among other things , ccbss provides procurement services to our north american operations and to our u.s . and canadian bottling partners for the purchase of various goods and services , including hfcs . the principal non - nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame , acesulfame potassium , sucralose , saccharin , cyclamate and steviol glycosides . generally , these raw materials are readily available from numerous sources . we purchase sucralose , which we consider a critical raw material , from suppliers in the united states and china . our company generally has not experienced major difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non - nutritive sweeteners . juice and juice concentrate from various fruits , particularly orange juice and orange juice concentrate , are the principal raw materials for our juice and juice drink products . we source our orange juice and orange juice concentrate primarily from florida and the southern hemisphere ( particularly brazil ) . we work closely with cutrale citrus juices u.s.a . , inc . , our primary supplier of orange juice from florida and brazil , to ensure an adequate supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate that meets our company ’s standards . however , the citrus industry is impacted by citrus greening disease and the variability of weather conditions that can affect the quality and supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate . in particular , freezing weather or hurricanes in central florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate throughout the industry . in addition , citrus greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices . milk is the principal raw material for our dairy products . we derive the majority of our dairy revenues through fairlife , llc ( “ fairlife ” ) , which purchases milk from dairy cooperatives that in turn source milk from farms within the cooperatives . while our sourcing for milk is currently concentrated among a few dairy cooperatives , we believe we have access to alternate suppliers , if necessary , to help ensure an adequate supply of milk . we generate most of our coffee revenues through costa . costa purchases rainforest alliance certified and other green coffee through multiple suppliers . while most of costa ’s coffee is sourced as readily available bulked commercial grade from brazil , vietnam and colombia , many of costa ’s suppliers have vertically integrated supply chains with direct access to yields from cooperatives and producer groups . our consolidated bottling operations and our non - bottling finished product operations also purchase various other raw materials , including , but not limited to , pet resin , preforms and bottles ; glass and aluminum bottles ; aluminum and steel cans ; plastic closures ; aseptic fiber packaging ; labels ; cartons ; cases ; postmix packaging ; and beverage gases , including carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen . while we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced significant shortages , certain packaging materials , such as aluminum cans , are available from a limited number of suppliers . patents , copyrights , trade secrets and trademarks our company owns numerous patents , copyrights , trade secrets and other know - how and technology , which we collectively refer to as “ technology . ” this technology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production ; packages and packaging materials ; design and operation of processes and equipment useful for our business ; and certain software . some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties . trade secrets are an important aspect of our technology , and our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulas are among the important trade secrets of our company . we also own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business . depending upon the jurisdiction , trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained . pursuant to our bottler ’s agreements , we authorize our bottlers to use applicable company trademarks in connection with their preparation , packaging , distribution and sale of company products . in addition , we authorize certain third parties to use applicable company trademarks in connection with their preparation , packaging , distribution and sale of beverages bearing company trademarks in certain territories . we also grant licenses to third parties from time to time to use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products . governmental regulation our company is required to comply , and it is our policy to comply , with all applicable laws in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business . in many jurisdictions , our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions . in the united states , the safety , production , storage , transportation , distribution , advertising , marketing , labeling and sale of our company ’s products and their ingredients are subject to the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ; the federal trade commission act ; the lanham act ; state consumer protection laws ; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices , including the robinson - patman act of [XXXX] , as amended , and the clayton antitrust act of [XXXX] , as amended ; federal , state and local workplace health and safety laws ; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices , including those related to equal employment opportunity and compensation ; various federal , state and local environmental protection laws ; privacy and personal data protection laws ; and various other federal , state and local statutes and regulations . we are also required to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act and the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act . outside the united states , our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations , as well as other legal and regulatory requirements and regulatory reviews . various jurisdictions have adopted , and may seek to adopt , significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects . if these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations , they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products . under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of [XXXX] ( “ proposition [XX] ” ) of the state of california , if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development , a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance , unless the conditions of an exemption ( described below ) can be met . the state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists . the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label . however , proposition [XX] exempts a product from a warning if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is : • below a “ safe harbor ” threshold that may be established ; • naturally occurring ; • the result of necessary cooking ; or • subject to another applicable exemption . one or more substances that are currently on the proposition [XX] list can be detected in certain company products at low levels that are safe . the company maintains that the presence of each such substance in company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with proposition [XX] . however , the state of california and other parties have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future . additionally , the state of california may include other substances on the proposition [XX] list in the future . bottlers of our beverage products presently offer , among other beverage containers , nonrefillable recyclable containers in the united states and various other markets around the world . some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers , which are also recyclable . legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the united states and elsewhere around the world requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale , marketing and use of certain beverage containers . the precise requirements imposed by these measures vary . other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits , recycling , ecotaxes , product stewardship and/or restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging , including certain packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( “ pfas ” ) , also apply in various jurisdictions in the united states and elsewhere around the world . we anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at federal , state and local levels , both in the united states and elsewhere around the world . all of our company ’s facilities and other operations in the united states and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations , including those relating to the use and treatment of water resources , discharge of wastewater and air emissions . in addition , increasing concern over climate change is expected to continue to result in additional legal or regulatory requirements ( both inside and outside the united states ) designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment , to discourage the use of plastic materials , to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns , or to expand disclosure of certain sustainability metrics . our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements . we have made , and plan on continuing to make , expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals . while compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our company ’s capital expenditures , net income or competitive position , changes in environmental compliance requirements along with expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements and to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals could adversely affect our financial performance . we are also subject to various federal , state and international laws and regulations related to cybersecurity , privacy and data protection , including the european union ’s general data protection regulation , china ’s personal information protection law and the california consumer privacy act of [XXXX] ( “ ccpa ” ) , which became effective on january [X] , [XXXX] , as amended by the california privacy rights act ( “ cpra ” ) , which became effective on january [X] , [XXXX] . in addition to california , at least [XX] other states in the united states have passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the ccpa and the cpra . these laws are either in effect or will go into effect sometime before the end of [XXXX] , and we expect other states to consider adopting similar laws in the future . like the ccpa and the cpra , these laws create , or are expected to create , obligations related to the processing of personal information , as well as special obligations for the processing of “ sensitive ” data . some of the provisions of these laws may apply to our business activities . the u.s . congress has also considered legislation relating to data privacy and data protection , and the u.s . federal government may in the future pass such legislation . the interpretation and application of privacy , data protection and data residency laws are often uncertain and are expanding in the united states and internationally , including in the european union , brazil , china and other jurisdictions . we monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and potential impact on our business , and we develop strategies to address regulatory trends and developments , including any required changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs and policies . globally , we see a trend toward data protection laws and regulations increasing in complexity and number , and we anticipate that our obligations will expand commensurately . as a result , our ability to maximize the utility of our data could be impacted and we may need to modify our practices to accommodate legal and regulatory constraints and obligations or meet consumer expectations . for additional information , refer to part i , “ item ia . risk factors ” of this report . human capital management our people and culture agendas are critical business

base pay , annual incentives and long - term incentives to help ensure fairness . when appropriate , we make adjustments . we support many employee - led inclusion networks , which are an integral part of operationalizing and embedding our diversity , equity and inclusion strategies . our inclusion networks are regionally structured to meet relevant local needs , and they provide employees with the opportunity to engage with colleagues around the world based on common interests or backgrounds . talent and development through our comprehensive global talent management processes , we continuously identify and develop our talent for acceleration in our networked organization . we believe in providing challenging and diverse experiences and opportunities to our people to help them develop and grow . our global career strategy program , called “ thrive , ” is designed to provide clarity to employees on what it means to have a career at the company . through our people - centered approach , we strive to create an integrated , streamlined and inspiring career experience . we believe that development is anchored in acquiring skills and work experiences . we focus on investing in

carefully consider the following factors , which could materially affect our business , financial condition and results of operations in future periods . the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company . additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business , financial condition or results of operations in future periods . risks related to our operations unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results . our business , operating results , financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions , including global inflationary pressures , prevailing interest rates , credit market conditions , increased unemployment , levels of consumer and business confidence , bank failures , commodity ( including energy ) prices and supply , a recession or economic slowdown , trade policies , foreign currency exchange rates , changing policy positions or priorities , governmental rules and approaches to taxation , levels of government spending and deficits , and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt . many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced , and could continue to experience , unfavorable changes in economic conditions , which could negatively affect the affordability of , and consumer demand for , our beverages , and certain markets in which our products are sold experienced intensified inflation throughout [XXXX] , which may continue to accelerate in [XXXX] . under difficult economic conditions , consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower - priced products offered by other companies , including private - label brands , which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance . in addition , the occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events , such as the covid-19 pandemic , and the related governmental , private sector and individual consumer responses , could contribute to a recession , depression or global economic downturn . other financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets , including international conflicts , civil unrest , acts of war , terrorism , governmental changes , or changes in international relations , could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers ’ purchasing power , thereby reducing demand for our products . geopolitical instability may also lead to heightened security risk , impacting employee safety and/or damage to infrastructure or our assets . at times , we have faced product boycotts resulting from activism , which have reduced demand for our products . restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders , price controls , limitations on profits , retaliatory tariffs , import authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities , which have been or may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability , deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise , could impact our profitability . in addition , u.s . trade sanctions against countries designated by the u.s . government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase significantly , which could make it difficult , or even impossible , for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries . the imposition of retaliatory sanctions against u.s . multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to u.s . trade sanctions , or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to u.s . trade sanctions or other governmental actions or policies , could also negatively affect our business . throughout [XXXX] , the company faced disruptions to our operations due to international conflicts , including the conflict between russia and ukraine and conflicts in the middle east . these conflicts have resulted , and could continue to result , in volatile commodity markets ; logistical , transportation and supply chain disruptions ; increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems ; reputational risk ; heightened risks to employee safety ; business disruptions ( including labor shortages ) ; reduced availability and increased costs of transportation , energy , packaging , raw materials and other input costs ; sanctions , export controls and other legislation or regulation ; or difficulty protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights . while we currently do not anticipate that the effects of these conflicts will have a material impact on our results of operations , we can not predict how and the extent to which these conflicts will continue to affect our employees , operations , customers or business partners . increased competition could hurt our business . we operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry . for additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate , including the names of certain of our significant competitors , refer to the heading “ competition ” set forth in part i , “ item [X] . business ” of this report . our ability to maintain or gain share of sales in the global market or in regional or local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors . competitive pressures may cause the company and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers ’ ability to increase prices , as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases . such pressures may also increase marketing costs along with in - store placement , slotting and other marketing fees . in addition , the rapid growth of e‑commerce may create additional consumer price deflation by , among other things , facilitating comparison shopping , and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route - to - market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues . if we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest , brand loyalty and market share while strategically expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry , our business could be negatively affected . if we are not successful in our innovation activities , our financial results may be negatively affected . achieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop , introduce and market new beverage products . the success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends ; obtain , maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property rights ; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others . if we are not successful in our innovation activities , we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives , which may have a negative impact on our financial results . changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results . our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in , and the blurring of the lines between , retail channels , particularly in europe and the united states . retailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners , may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures in support of their businesses , and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private - label brands , any of which could negatively affect the coca - cola system ’s profitability . in addition , in developed markets , discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace , while in emerging and developing markets , modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets . our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e - commerce retailers , e - commerce websites , mobile commerce applications and subscription services , which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels . as we and our bottling partners build e - commerce capabilities , we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e - commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels . if we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape , including the rapid growth in digital commerce , our share of sales , volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected . in addition , our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and foodservice customers . the loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance . if we are unable to expand our business in emerging and developing markets , our growth could be negatively affected . our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets , which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities , distribution networks , sales equipment and technology . additionally , we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets . scarcity of , or heavy competition for , talented employees could impede our abilities in such markets . moreover , the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match consumer demand for those products . due to product price , limited purchasing power and cultural differences , our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or developing market . if we do not successfully manage the potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives , our business operations could be adversely affected . we believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long - term growth objectives and , therefore , a leading priority of our company is to design and implement the most effective and efficient business model possible . consequently , we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business . some of the actions we may take from time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations ; cause deterioration in employee morale , which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees ; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations ; and give rise to negative publicity , which could affect our corporate reputation . if we are unable to successfully manage the potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives , our business operations could be adversely affected . if we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce , our business could be negatively affected . the success of our business depends on our company ’s and the coca - cola system ’s ability to attract , hire , develop , motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce as well as on our success in nurturing a culture that supports our growth and aligns employees around the company ’s purpose and work that matters most . competition for , along with compensation and benefits expectations of , existing and prospective employees has increased , especially in light of changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models . in addition , the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of qualified workers , which has further increased the competition we face for qualified employees . we may not be able to successfully compete for , attract or retain the highly skilled and diverse workforce that we want and may require for our future business needs , such as employees with advanced technology , artificial intelligence and machine learning , social media and digital marketing skills , and/or digital and analytics capabilities . changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical , professional and management personnel to meet our business needs . in addition , the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled employees due to an increase in aggressive recruiting for best - in - class talent could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness . failure to attract , hire , develop , motivate and retain highly skilled and diverse talent ; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture ; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for our management team ; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation , collaboration and inclusion ; or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success . disruption of our supply chain , including increased commodity , raw material , packaging , energy , transportation and other input costs , may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations . at times , we have experienced , and could continue to experience , disruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain . in connection with our manufacturing and bottling operations , we and our bottling partners are dependent upon , among other things , various ingredients and other raw materials and packaging materials . for additional information on the raw materials and supplies we use in our business , refer to the heading “ raw materials ” set forth in part i , “ item [X] . business ” of this report . some of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak . we and our bottling partners may not be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers , and our contingency plans may not be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredients or other raw materials . furthermore , some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political instability or other risks and/or unfavorable economic conditions . in addition , adverse and extreme weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived . any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply , which could adversely impact our business . we and our independent bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute beverage products to customers . in addition , we and our independent bottlers use a significant amount of electricity , natural gas and other energy sources to operate production plants , bottling plants and distribution facilities . increases in energy demand have in the past resulted , and could in the future result , in higher energy prices , impacting us and our independent bottlers . the raw materials and other supplies , including ingredients , agricultural commodities , energy , fuel , packaging materials , transportation , labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the production and distribution of our products , are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors . these factors include changes in supply and demand ; supplier capacity constraints ; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners ’ relationships with suppliers ; international conflicts ; political uncertainties ; acts of terrorism ; governmental instability ; inflation ; weather conditions ( including the effects of climate change ) ; wildfires , floods and other natural disasters ; disease or pests ( including the impact of citrus greening disease on the citrus industry ) ; agricultural uncertainty ; health epidemics , pandemics or other contagious outbreaks ( including covid-19 ) ; labor shortages , strikes or work stoppages ; changes in or the enactment of new laws and regulations ; governmental actions or controls ( including import / export restrictions , such as new or increased tariffs , sanctions , quotas or trade barriers ) ; port congestion or delays ; transport capacity constraints ; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions ; or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation . we expect the inflationary pressures on certain input and other costs to continue to impact our business in [XXXX] . our attempts to offset cost pressures , such as through price increases of some of our products , may not be successful . higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume . consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower - priced offerings , or may forgo some purchases altogether . to the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner , and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume , our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected . furthermore , we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity . if we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses , brands or bottling operations , or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships , our financial results could suffer . we routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities . additionally , from time to time , we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations , often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance . acquisitions of businesses , brands or bottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks , and the expected benefits , including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions , may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all . we have encountered , and may in the future encounter , challenges in successfully integrating the operations , technologies , services , products and systems of any acquired businesses , brands or bottling partners in an effective , timely and cost - efficient manner . we have faced , and may in the future face , difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain models , or in new categories or territories , and challenges in extending company controls ( including internal controls over financial reporting , disclosure controls and procedures , data protection and cybersecurity ) , policies and governance structures ( including with respect to food safety and quality , occupational safety , and sustainability ) to newly acquired businesses , brands or bottling operations , which , at times , has resulted in increased costs and negative publicity . our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage our acquisitions , and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses , brands or bottling operations . if we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses , brands or bottling operations , experience internal control or product quality failures , or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses , brands or bottling operations , our consolidated results could be negatively affected . we also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses , joint ventures and strategic relationships . if we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships , including our relationship with monster , or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we expect from our joint ventures or strategic relationships , our financial performance could be adversely affected . if our third - party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities , or experience adverse events , our financial results could suffer . in the conduct of our business , we rely on relationships with third parties , including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers , suppliers , distributors , contractors , joint venture partners and other external business partners , for certain services in support of key portions of our operations . these third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity , privacy violations , business interruption , and systems and employee failures , and are subject to legal , regulatory and market risks of their own . our third - party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed - upon terms or applicable laws . in addition , while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting , managing and monitoring our relationships with third - party service providers and other business partners , we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems , practices and procedures , which increases our financial , legal , cybersecurity , reputational and operational risk . if we are unable to effectively manage our third - party relationships , or for any reason our third - party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or experience events that could directly or indirectly impact us , our financial results could suffer . if we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms , or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes , work stoppages or labor unrest , our business could suffer . many of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements . while we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory , negotiations may nevertheless be challenging , as the company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees . if we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms , our labor costs could increase , which could affect our profit margins . in addition , many of our bottling partners ’ employees are represented by labor unions . strikes , work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers ’ plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers ’ ability to supply finished beverages to customers , which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims . furthermore , from time to time , we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity , which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance , result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements . if these labor relations are not effectively managed at the local level , they could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our company ’s overall reputation and brand image , which in turn could have a negative impact on our products ’ acceptance by consumers . risks related to consumer demand for our products obesity and other health - related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products . there is concern among consumers , public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity . ongoing public concern about obesity ; other health - related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages ; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight - loss drugs on consumption patterns ; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue ; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising , marketing , labeling , packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages ; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing , labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for , or increase the cost of , our sweetened beverages , which could adversely affect our profitability . if we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences , our business could suffer . consumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of , among other things , health , wellness and nutrition considerations , including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients ; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of , or location of origin of , ingredients , raw materials or substances in our products or packaging , including due to the results of third - party studies ( whether or not scientifically valid ) ; shifting consumer demographics ; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods ; changes in consumer lifestyles ; concerns regarding the environmental , social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process ; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of , and amount of recycled content contained in , our packaging containers and other materials ; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain ; and competitive product and pricing pressures . in addition , in many of our markets , shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution , with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications , e - commerce retailers and e - commerce websites or platforms . if we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences , do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences , or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives , our share of sales , revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected . product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business . our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products . we have rigorous product safety and quality standards , which we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet . however , despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality , we or our bottling partners at times have not met , and may not always meet , these standards , particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories , such as value - added dairy and plant - based beverages , that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products . we and our bottling partners have had , and may in the future need , to recall products if they become contaminated or adulterated by any means or if they are mislabeled . a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall , the destruction of product inventory , and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time , and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity , all of which could cause our business to suffer . public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients , such as non - nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology - derived substances , and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials , may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation . public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products , such as synthetic colors , non - nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology - derived substances ; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process , such as [X] - methylimidazole ( “ [X] - mei ” ) , a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola - flavored beverages ; or substances used in packaging materials , such as bisphenol a ( “ bpa ” ) , an odorless , tasteless food - grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans , may affect consumers ’ preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage products . in addition , increasing public concern about perceived or potential health consequences of the presence of ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in packaging materials ( or alleged presence of substances such as pfas ) and/or the results of third - party studies ( whether or not scientifically valid ) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted , and could result , in additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising , marketing , labeling , packaging or sale of our beverages ; limitations on the use of certain ingredients or packaging ; potential new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities ; and negative publicity , or actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry , all of which could damage the reputation of , and may reduce demand for , our beverage products . if we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the coca - cola system , our financial results could be negatively affected . the digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers , customers , suppliers , bottlers and other business partners and stakeholders . we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment . therefore , one of our top priorities is to digitalize the coca - cola system by , among other things , creating more relevant and more personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers , whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in an otherwise physical environment ; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the coca - cola system ’s retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses ; and digitalizing operations through the use of data , artificial intelligence , automation , robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity . if we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the coca - cola system , our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be negatively affected , and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our digitalization initiatives may adversely impact our financial performance . if negative publicity , whether or not warranted , concerning product safety or quality , workplace and human rights , obesity or other issues damages our brand image , corporate reputation and social license to operate , our business may suffer . our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products , build the brand image for new products and brand extensions , and maintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate . however , our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights have not always had , and may not in the future always have , the desired impact on our products ’ brand image and on consumer preferences . product safety or quality issues , actual or perceived , or allegations of product contamination , even when false or unfounded , could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products . in some emerging markets , the production and sale of counterfeit or “ spurious ” products , which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat , may damage the image and reputation of our products . in addition , from time to time , we and our executives have engaged , and may in the future engage , in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the company . these engagements in public policy debates have been , and could in the future be , the subject of criticism from advocacy groups or others that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction , including product boycotts . similarly , our sponsorship relationships and associations with influencers have subjected us in the past , and could subject us in the future , to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals , hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in - kind contributions , as well as by the influencers we collaborate with who may engage in actions or express opinions that may negatively reflect on our brand . likewise , campaigns by activists connecting us , or our bottling system or supply chain , with workplace , human rights or animal welfare issues , whether actual or perceived , could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation . additionally , negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands , even if inaccurate or malicious , have in the past , and could in the future , generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company . furthermore , allegations , even if untrue , that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights ; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws , including child labor laws , or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers ; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers , joint venture partners or other business partners to engage in proper animal welfare practices ; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products , water usage , environmental impact , labor relations or the like could negatively affect our company ’s overall reputation and brand image , which in turn could have a negative impact on our products ’ acceptance by consumers . in addition , if we fail to respect our employees ’ and our supply chain workers ’ human rights , or inadvertently discriminate against any group of employees or hiring prospects , our ability to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished , which could have an adverse impact on our overall business . if we are unable to successfully manage new product launches , our business and financial results could be adversely affected . due to the highly competitive nature of the commercial beverage industry , the company continually introduces new products and evolves existing products to stimulate consumer demand . for instance , the company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the united states , and in the united states , the company has established a wholly owned , indirect , firewalled subsidiary , which authorizes alcohol - licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain company beverage bases . the success of new and evolved products depends on several factors , including timely and successful product development , adherence to new global and/or local standards of practice , consumer acceptance and stakeholder perception . such endeavors may also involve significant risks and uncertainties , including greater execution risks ; higher costs ; lower rates of sales ; distraction of management from existing operations ; lower product , category or industry knowledge and expertise ; slower than expected or inadequate return on investments ; increased competitive pressures ; stakeholder scrutiny ; and reliance on the performance of third parties . as we become subject to additional governmental regulations , including alcohol regulations related to licensing , trade and pricing practices , labeling , advertising , promotion and marketing practices , and relationships with distributors , we may become exposed to the risk of increased compliance costs and disruptions to our existing business . risks related to the coca - cola system we rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business . if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners , our business could suffer . we generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners . as independent companies , our bottling partners , some of which are publicly traded companies , make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests . in addition , some of our bottling partners have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies . if we are unable to maintain operating and strategic alignment or agree on appropriate pricing and marketing and advertising support , or if our bottling partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts , they may take actions that , while maximizing their own short - term profits , may be detrimental to our company or our brands , or they may devote more of their resources to business opportunities or products other than those of the company . such actions could , in the long term , have an adverse effect on our profitability . if our bottling partners ’ financial condition deteriorates , our business and financial results could be affected . in the vast majority of our markets , our products are sold and distributed by independent bottling partners , and we therefore derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners . accordingly , the success of our business depends in part on our bottling partners ’ financial strength and profitability . while under our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our concentrates and syrups , our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners ’ financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers . in addition , we have investments in certain of our bottling partners , which we account for under the equity method , and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners ’ income or loss . our bottling partners ’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control , including competitive and general market conditions ; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms ; loss of major customers ; changes in or additional regulations ; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes , work stoppages , labor unrest , natural disasters , international conflicts , acts of war , health epidemics , pandemics or other catastrophic events . a deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups ; and , if such deterioration involves one or more of our equity method investee bottling partners , it could also result in a decrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments . we may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses , which could adversely affect our business and results of operations . as part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners , we continue to seek opportunities to refranchise our consolidated bottling operations . our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of , and therefore may be a distraction for , senior management . if we are unable to complete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us , or if our refranchising partners are not efficient or not aligned with our long - term vision for the coca - cola system , our business and results of operations could be adversely affected . additionally , we have divested and may in the future divest certain brands or businesses . these divestitures may adversely impact our business , results of operations , cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses , or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures . risks related to regulatory and legal matters increases in income tax rates , changes in income tax laws or regulations , or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results . we are subject to income tax in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits . our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate , tax treaties between such jurisdictions , and the geographic mix of our income before income taxes , which is itself impacted by currency movements . consequently , the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates , geographic mix or foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our net income . tax laws and regulations , including rates of taxation , are subject to revisions by individual taxing jurisdictions , and such revisions may result from multilateral agreements . many jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the organization for economic co - operation and development ’s ( “ oecd ” ) anti - base erosion and profit shifting project . the oecd is currently coordinating a two pillared project on behalf of the g20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered . pillar one would allow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by multinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding € [XX] billion and a profit margin of over [XX] % to applicable market jurisdictions . while the oecd issued draft language for the international implementation of pillar one in october [XXXX] , both the substantive rules and implementation process remain under discussion at the oecd so the timetable for any implementation remains uncertain . in december [XXXX] , the oecd issued pillar two model rules which would establish a global per - country minimum tax of [XX] % , and the european union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective domestic laws . the directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after december [XX] , [XXXX] . while it is uncertain whether the united states will enact legislation to adopt pillar two , numerous countries have enacted legislation , or have indicated their intent to adopt legislation , to implement certain aspects of pillar two effective january [X] , [XXXX] , with general implementation of the remaining global minimum tax rules by january [X] , [XXXX] . the oecd and implementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance . the company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate . to the extent additional legislative changes take place in the countries in which we operate , it is possible that these changes may increase uncertainty and have a material impact on our net income and cash flow . significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions . although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable , the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions , estimates and accruals . the results of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open . for instance , the united states internal revenue service ( “ irs ” ) is seeking to increase our u.s . taxable income for tax years [XXXX] through [XXXX] by an amount that creates a potential additional u.s . federal income tax liability of approximately $ [X.X] billion for that period , plus interest . the company firmly believes that the irs ’ claims are without merit and is pursuing , and will continue to pursue , all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position . on november [XX] , [XXXX] , the u.s . tax court ( “ tax court ” ) issued an opinion ( “ opinion ” ) predominantly siding with the irs . on november [X] , [XXXX] , the tax court issued a supplemental opinion ( together with the original tax court opinion , “ opinions ” ) also siding with the irs as to the validity of the blocked - income regulations and its application to the brazilian legal restrictions . although the company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the opinions and intends to vigorously defend its position , considering all avenues of appeal , there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the company ’s favor . it is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the opinions could ultimately be upheld . in that event , the company would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the opinions were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the opinions . moreover , the irs could successfully appeal the portions of the opinions that are favorable to the company and/or assert new claims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees . these adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the company ’s financial position , results of operations and cash flows . any such adjustments related to years prior to [XXXX] , either in the litigation period or thereafter , may also have an impact on the transition tax payable as part of the [XXXX] tax cuts and jobs act ( “ tax reform act ” ) . for additional information regarding the tax litigation , refer to part i , “ item [X] . legal proceedings ” of this report . increased or new indirect taxes could negatively affect our business . our business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income , sometimes referred to as “ indirect taxes , ” including import duties , tariffs , excise taxes , sales or value - added taxes , taxes on sweetened or aerated beverages , packaging taxes , carbon taxes , property taxes and payroll taxes , in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate . in addition , in the past , the u.s . congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar , hfcs or other nutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the future . as federal , state and local governments in the united states and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits , some lawmakers have singled out beverages among a plethora of revenue - raising items and have imposed or increased , or proposed to impose or increase , sales or similar taxes on beverages , particularly sweetened beverages and alcohol beverages , as well as packaging and/or packaging materials . increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or , to the extent levied directly on consumers , make our products less affordable , which may negatively impact our net operating revenues and profitability . changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products . we and our bottlers offer , among other beverage containers , nonrefillable containers in the united states and in various other markets around the world . legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale , marketing and use of certain beverage containers . other proposals relating to beverage container deposits , recycling , recycling content , tethered bottle caps , ecotax and/or product stewardship , or prohibitions on certain types of plastic products , packages and cups ( including packaging containing pfas ) have been introduced and/or adopted in various jurisdictions , and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at federal , state and local levels , both in the united states and elsewhere . consumers ’ increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of additional such legislation or regulations in the future . if these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale , they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model , which could reduce our net operating revenues and profitability . significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products . various jurisdictions have adopted , and may seek to adopt , significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects . if these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations , they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products , resulting in adverse effects on our business . for example , under one such law in california , known as proposition [XX] , if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development , a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance , unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable . for additional information regarding proposition [XX] , refer to the heading “ governmental regulation ” set forth in part i , “ item [X] . business ” of this report . if we were required to add proposition [XX] warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in california , the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and potential adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in california and in other markets . litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation . we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business , including , but not limited to , those arising out of our advertising and marketing practices , product claims and labels , competition , distribution and pricing , personal data protection and privacy , intellectual property and commercial disputes , tax disputes , and environmental and employment matters . we evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate , if possible , the amount of potential losses . based on these assessments and estimates , we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings , as appropriate . these assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment . actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates . we conduct business in markets with high - risk legal compliance environments , which exposes us to increased legal and reputational risk . we have bottling and other business operations in markets with high - risk legal compliance environments . our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all united states and local laws and regulations and consent orders applicable to our business operations , including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials . nonetheless , our policies , procedures and related training programs may not always ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements . improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the united states and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties , including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits . failure to adequately protect , or disputes relating to , trademarks , formulas and other intellectual property rights could harm our business . our trademarks , formulas and other intellectual property rights ( refer to the heading “ patents , copyrights , trade secrets and trademarks ” in part i , “ item [X] . business ” of this report ) are essential to the success of our business . we can not be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that , notwithstanding legal protection , others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights . if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights , or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them , the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer . in addition , we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights , which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation . any of the foregoing could harm our business . changes in , or failure to comply with , the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues . our company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business , including laws and regulations relating to competition , distribution and pricing , product safety , product design , advertising and labeling , container deposits , recycling , recycled content , product stewardship , the protection of the environment , occupational health and safety , employment and labor practices , machine learning and artificial intelligence , personal data protection and privacy , and data security . for additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business , refer to the heading “ governmental regulation ” set forth in part i , “ item [X] . business ” of this report . changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof , changes in enforcement priorities of regulators , and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made , manufactured , distributed or sold , have in the past resulted in , and could continue to result in , higher compliance costs , higher capital expenditures and higher production costs , or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products , resulting in adverse effects on our business . in addition , increased or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change ; to discourage the use of plastic materials , including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns ; to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns ; or to address wastewater discharge to protect local bodies of water , have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs , capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners , which could affect our profitability , or may impede the production , distribution , marketing and sale of our products , which could affect our net operating revenues . failure to comply with various laws and regulations ( or allegations thereof ) , such as u.s . trade sanctions , the u.s . foreign corrupt practices act and the office of foreign assets control trade sanction regulations and anti - boycott regulations ; antitrust and competition laws ; anti - modern slavery laws ; anti - bribery and anti - corruption laws ; data privacy laws , including the european union ’s general data protection regulation and china ’s personal information protection law ; tax laws and regulations ; and a variety of other applicable local , national and multinational regulations and laws , could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions , including voluntary and involuntary document requests , the assessment of damages , the imposition of penalties , the suspension of production or distribution , costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action , or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners ’ facilities , as well as damage to our or our bottling partners ’ image and reputation , all of which could harm our or our bottling partners ’ profitability . risks related to finance , accounting and investments fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results . we earn revenues , pay expenses , own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the u.s . dollar . in [XXXX] , we derived $ [XX.X] billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the united states . because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s . dollars , we must translate revenues , income and expenses , as well as assets and liabilities , into u.s . dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period . therefore , increases or decreases in the value of the u.s . dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues , operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies . global events , including political instability , international conflicts , trade disputes , economic sanctions , inflation , increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility , and the resulting uncertainties , may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the u.s . dollar . due to the geographic diversity of our operations , weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time . we also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations . however , fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates , particularly the strengthening of the u.s . dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries , could materially affect our financial results . if interest rates increase , our net income could be negatively affected . we maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows , interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital . we use debt financing to lower our cost of capital , which increases our return on shareowners ’ equity . this exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates . when and to the extent appropriate , we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks . however , our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations . on december [XX] , [XXXX] , the united kingdom ’s financial conduct authority , the governing body responsible for regulating the london interbank offered rate ( “ libor ” ) , ceased to publish certain libor reference rates . other libor reference rates , including u.s . dollar overnight , [X] - month , [X] - month , [X] - month and [XX] - month maturities , ceased to be published in july [XXXX] . as a result of the discontinuation of libor , we have amended our libor - referencing agreements to either reference the secured overnight financing rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate , but it is possible that these changes may have an adverse impact on our financing costs as compared to libor in the long term . our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings . in assessing our credit strength , credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the company . in addition , some credit rating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major bottling partners . it is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology . if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure ; our major bottling partners ’ financial performance ; changes in the credit rating agencies ’ methodology in assessing our credit strength ; the credit agencies ’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our or our major bottling partners ’ current or future financial performance and financial condition ; or for any other reason , our cost of borrowing could increase . additionally , if the credit ratings of certain bottling partners in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded , such bottling partners ’ interest expense could increase , which would reduce our equity income . if we are unable to achieve our overall long - term growth objectives , the value of an investment in our company could be negatively affected . we have established and publicly announced certain long - term growth objectives . these objectives are based on , among other things , our evaluation of our growth prospects , which are generally driven by the sales potential of our many beverage products , some of which are more profitable than others , and on an assessment of the potential price and product mix . we may not be able to realize the sales potential and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long - term growth objectives . default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses . as part of our hedging activities , we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments , including forward contracts , commodity futures contracts , option contracts , collars and swaps , with various financial institutions . in addition , we have significant amounts of cash , cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad . as a result , we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions . the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets . if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy , our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty ’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings . in the event of default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties , we could incur significant losses , which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition . we may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial results . we assess our noncurrent assets , including trademarks , goodwill and other intangible assets , equity method investments and other long - lived assets , as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to determine whether they are impaired and , if they are , we record appropriate impairment charges . our equity method investees also perform similar recoverability and impairment tests , and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them adjusted , as appropriate , for the impact of items such as basis differences , deferred taxes and deferred gains . it is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges or our proportionate share of significant impairment charges recorded by equity method investees in the future and , if we do so , our net income could be materially adversely affected . risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy if we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption , misappropriation of data or cybersecurity incidents , our operations could be disrupted , we may suffer financial losses and our reputation may be damaged . we rely on networks and information systems and other technology ( “ information systems ” ) , including the internet and third - party hosted services , to support a variety of business processes and activities , including procurement and supply chain , manufacturing , distribution , invoicing and collection of payments , employee processes , consumer marketing , mergers and acquisitions , and research and development . we use information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements . in addition , we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between company employees and our bottlers , customers , suppliers , consumers and other third parties . because information systems are critical to many of the company ’s operating activities , our business may be impacted by system shutdowns , service disruptions or cybersecurity incidents . these incidents may be caused by failures during routine operations , such as system upgrades , or by user errors , as well as network or hardware failures , malicious or disruptive software , unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors , cyberattacks by hackers , criminal groups or nation - state organizations ( which may include deepfake or social engineering schemes , ransomware and other forms of malware , business email compromise , cyber extortion , denial of service , or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access ) , geopolitical events , natural disasters , failures or impairments of telecommunications networks , or other catastrophic events . cybercriminals have increasingly demonstrated advanced capabilities , such as use of zero - day vulnerabilities , and rapid integration of new technology such as generative artificial intelligence . in addition , cybersecurity incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental access to or disclosure of material confidential information or regulated personal data . if our information systems or third - party information systems on which we rely suffer severe damage , disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner , we could experience delays in reporting our financial results , and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture , distribute , invoice and collect payments for concentrates or finished products . unauthorized or accidental access to , or destruction , loss , alteration , disclosure , falsification or unavailability of , information , or unauthorized access to machines and equipment could result in violations of data protection laws and regulations , misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment , damage to the reputation and credibility of the company , loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands , and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and , therefore , could have a negative impact on net operating revenues . in addition , we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us , our current or former employees , our bottling partners , other customers or suppliers , or consumers or other data subjects , and may become exposed to legal action and increased regulatory oversight , including governmental investigations , enforcement actions and regulatory fines . the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or to repair or replace networks and information systems . these risks are also present with respect to our bottling partners , distributors , joint venture partners and suppliers that generally use separate information systems , not integrated with the information systems of the company , and that have cybersecurity programs and processes that differ in scope and complexity from our overall cybersecurity programs and processes . while we have established a third - party risk management program to address security risks , including relating to our bottling partners , our ability to monitor their security measures is limited , and we may experience secondary contractual , regulatory financial and reputational harm as a result of cybersecurity attacks , phishing attacks , viruses , malware , ransomware , hacking or similar breaches experienced by our bottling partners . these risks may also be present to the extent a business or bottler we have acquired , but which does not use our information systems , experiences severe damage , a system shutdown , service disruption or a cybersecurity incident . like most major corporations , the company ’s information systems are a target of attacks . in addition , third - party providers of data hosting or cloud services , as well as our bottling partners , distributors , joint venture partners , suppliers or acquired businesses that use separate information systems , may experience cybersecurity incidents that may involve data we share with them . although the cybersecurity incidents that we have experienced to date , as well as those reported to us by our third - party partners , have not had a material effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations , such incidents could have a material adverse effect on us in the future . in order to address risks to our information systems , we continue to make investments in personnel , technologies and training . data protection laws and regulations around the world often require “ reasonable , ” “ appropriate ” or “ adequate ” technical and organizational security measures , and the interpretation and application of those laws and regulations are often uncertain and evolving ; there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate , appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court . moreover , even security measures that are deemed adequate , appropriate , reasonable or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not protect the information we maintain against increasingly sophisticated attacks . in addition to potential fines , we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a cybersecurity incident , which could adversely affect our business operations and result in substantial costs for years to come . while we have purchased cybersecurity insurance , there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses . moreover , as cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude , we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in types and amounts we view as appropriate for our operations . if we fail to comply with privacy and data protection laws , we could be subject to adverse publicity , business disruption , data loss , government enforcement actions and/or private litigation , any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results . in the ordinary course of our business , we receive , process , transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals ( “ personal data ” ) , including employees , former employees , vendors , third - party personnel , customers and consumers with whom we interact . as a result , we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy and data protection . these privacy and data protection laws may include different standards and obligations or may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements . in addition , new legislation in this area may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time or may revise the law in jurisdictions that already have privacy regulations . these laws impose operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data , and many provide for significant penalties for noncompliance . some laws and regulations also impose obligations regarding cross - border data transfers of personal data . these requirements with respect to personal data have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the company to , among other things , additional costs and expenses and have required and may in the future require costly changes to our business practices and information technology and security systems , policies , procedures and practices . in addition , some countries are considering or have enacted data localization or residency laws , which require that certain data be maintained , stored and/or processed within their country of origin . maintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly . our security controls over personal data , the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security , and the policies , procedures and practices we have implemented or may implement in the future may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal data by us or the third - party service providers and vendors whose technology , systems and services we use in connection with the receipt , storage and transmission of personal data . our bottling partners , distributors , joint venture partners and suppliers have privacy and security controls and policies over personal data that differ in scope and complexity from our policies , procedures and practices , and we may also experience secondary contractual , regulatory , financial and reputational harm as a result of improper disclosure of personal data by our bottling partners . unauthorized access to or improper disclosure of personal data in violation of privacy and data protection laws could harm our reputation , cause loss of consumer confidence , subject us to regulatory enforcement actions ( including penalties , fines and investigations ) , and result in private litigation against us , which could result in loss of revenue , increased costs , liability for monetary damages , fines and/or criminal prosecution , all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results . we have incurred , and will continue to incur , expenses to comply with privacy and data protection standards and protocols imposed by law , regulation , industry standards and contractual obligations . increased regulation of data collection , use , disclosure and retention practices , including self - regulation and industry standards , changes in existing laws and regulations , enactment of new laws and regulations , increased enforcement activity , and changes in interpretation of laws , could increase our cost of compliance and operation , limit our ability to grow our business or otherwise harm our business . risks related to environmental and social factors our business is subject to evolving sustainability regulatory requirements and expectations , which exposes us to increased costs and legal and reputational risks . we have established and publicly announced sustainability goals and aspirations . we also report progress related to the circular economy of packaging ; water stewardship ; climate ; portfolio ; sustainable agriculture ; human and workplace rights and diversity , equity and inclusion . these goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them . our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents numerous operational , financial , legal and other risks and is dependent on the actions of our bottling partners , suppliers and other third parties , some of which are outside of our control . if we are unable to meet our sustainability goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards , or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for sustainability issues , our reputation , and therefore our ability to sell products , could be negatively impacted . in addition , in recent years , investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on sustainability . if , as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices , certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress , they may reconsider their investment in our company . at the same time , there also exists “ anti - esg ” sentiment among certain stakeholders and government institutions , and we may face scrutiny , reputational risk , product boycotts , lawsuits or market access restrictions from these parties regarding our sustainability initiatives . increasing focus on sustainability matters has resulted in , and is expected to continue to result in , evolving legal and regulatory requirements , including mandatory due diligence , disclosure and reporting requirements , as well as a variety of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards . we have incurred , and are likely to continue to incur , increased costs complying with such standards and regulations , particularly given the lack of convergence among standards . in addition , our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards and regulations for identifying , measuring and reporting sustainability metrics ; our interpretation of reporting standards and regulations may differ from those of others ; and such standards and regulations may change over time , any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals . in addition , methodologies for reporting our data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third - party data , changing assumptions , changes in the nature and scope of our operations ( including from acquisitions and divestitures ) , and other changes in circumstances . any failure or perceived failure , whether or not valid , to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and aspirations or to satisfy various sustainability reporting standards or regulatory requirements within the timelines we announce , or at all , could increase the risk of litigation or result in regulatory actions . increasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and increased production and distribution costs . there are increasing concerns among consumers , governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the accumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging materials in the environment , particularly in the world ’s waterways , lakes and oceans , as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a circular economy . we and our bottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that , while largely recyclable , may not be regularly recovered and recycled due to lack of collection and recycling infrastructure . if we and our bottling partners do not , or are perceived not to , act responsibly to address plastic materials recoverability and recycling concerns and associated waste management issues , our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged , which may cause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products . in addition , from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the coca - cola system ’s impact on the environment by , for example , increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials ; increasing our use of packaging materials that are made in part of plant - based renewable materials ; expanding our use of reusable packaging ( including refillable or returnable glass and plastic bottles , as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our beverages ) ; participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover bottles and other packaging materials that are already in the environment ; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups . if we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our announced environmental goals and targets , the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products . in addition , in response to environmental concerns , governmental entities in the united states and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted , or are considering adopting , regulations and policies designed to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled content minimums , or , in some cases , restrict or even prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials . these regulations and policies , whatever their scope or form , could increase the cost of our beverage products or otherwise put the company at a competitive disadvantage . in addition , our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging materials waste has in the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to increase our capital expenditures . a reduction in consumer demand for our products and/or an increase in costs and expenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and other packaging materials could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations . water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the coca - cola system ’s costs and capacity . water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products , is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process . it also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems in which we operate . water is a limited resource in many parts of the world , facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation , increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require water , increasing pollution and emerging awareness of potential contaminants , poor management , lack of physical or financial access to water , sociopolitical tensions due to lack of public infrastructure in certain areas of the world and the effects of climate change . as the demand for water continues to increase around the world , and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates , the coca - cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the possibility of reputational damage , which could adversely affect our profitability . increased demand for food products , decreased agricultural productivity and increased regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence may negatively affect our business . as part of the manufacture of our beverage products , we and our bottling partners use a number of key ingredients that are derived from agricultural commodities such as sugarcane , corn , sugar beets , citrus , coffee and tea . increased demand for food products ; decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns ; loss of biodiversity ; increased agricultural regulations , including regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence ; and other factors have in the past , and may in the future , limit the availability and/or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world . if we are unable to implement programs focused on economic opportunity and environmental sustainability to address these agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food security through joint efforts with bottlers , farmers , communities , suppliers and key partners , as well as through our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture , our ability to source raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes and the affordability of our products and ultimately our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted . climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have a long - term adverse impact on our business and results of operations . there is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters . decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities , such as sugarcane , corn , sugar beets , citrus , coffee and tea , which are important ingredients for our products , and could impact the food security of communities around the world . climate change may also exacerbate extreme weather , resulting in water scarcity or flooding , and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions , which could limit water availability for the coca - cola system ’s bottling operations . increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities , disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products . increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment , and/or may result in increased disclosure obligations . increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in , or an increase in the costs associated with , the manufacturing and distribution of our beverage products . the physical effects and transition costs of climate change and legal , regulatory or market initiatives to address climate change could have a long - term adverse impact on our business and results of operations . in addition , from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the coca - cola system ’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging materials , expanding our renewable energy usage , and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide . if we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals and targets , the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our beverage products . adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products . the sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate . unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales , which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods ."

commerce platforms and retailers . the distribution system used depends on customer needs , product characteristics and local trade practices . table of contents direct - store - delivery we , our independent bottlers and our distributors operate dsd systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers . dsd enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal . dsd is especially well - suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in - store promotion and merchandising . customer warehouse some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers , both company and third - party operated , to customer warehouses . these less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable , and have lower turnover . distributor networks we distribute many of our products through third - party distributors . third - party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles . for example , our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants , businesses , schools and stadiums through third - party foodservice and vending distributors and operators . e - commerce our products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company - owned and third - party e - commerce websites and mobile commerce applications . ingredients and other supplies the principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are acesulfame potassium , aspartame , corn , corn sweeteners , flavorings , flour , juice concentrates , oats , potatoes , raw milk , rice , seasonings , sucralose , sugar , vegetable and essential oils , and wheat . we also use water in the manufacturing of our products . our key packaging materials include plastic resins , including polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods , aluminum , glass , closures , cardboard and paperboard cartons . in addition , we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content , including recycled pet , in our packaging . fuel , electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners ’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products . we employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements . many of these ingredients , raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market . the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation , and we manage this risk through the use of fixed - price contracts and purchase orders , pricing agreements and derivative instruments , including swaps and futures . in addition , risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers . when prices increase , we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers . in addition , we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain , including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally . during [XXXX] , we continued to experience increased commodity , packaging and other input costs and , in some instances , supply constraints related to the deadly conflict in ukraine , the inflationary cost environment , adverse weather conditions , supply chain disruptions and labor shortages , which may continue into fiscal [XXXX] . see note [X] to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices . table of contents we also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions , pursuant to which our suppliers , at their sole discretion , may elect to sell their accounts receivable with pepsico to such global financial institutions . these agreements did not have a material impact on our business or financial results . see “ our financial results – our liquidity and capital resources ” in “ item [X] . management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and note [XX] to our consolidated financial statements for further information . our brands and intellectual property rights we own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses , including agusha , amp energy , aquafina , aquafina flavorsplash , arto lifewtr , baja blast , baicaowei , bare , bokomo , bubly , cap’n crunch , ceres , cheetos , chester ’s , chipsy , chokis , chudo , cracker jack , crunchy , diet mountain dew , diet mug , diet pepsi , diet 7up ( outside the united states ) , domik v derevne , doritos , driftwell , duyvis , elma chips , emperador , evolve , fast twitch , frito -

term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets , including ocean spray . we also distribute celsius energy drinks and various keurig dr pepper inc . brands , including dr pepper in certain markets , crush and schweppes . joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks , such as lipton , sabra and starbucks . in addition , in the first quarter of [XXXX] , we sold our tropicana , naked and other select juice brands to pai partners , while retaining a [XX] % noncontrolling interest in tbg , operating across north america and europe . in the united states , pepsico acts as the exclusive distributor for tbg ’s portfolio of brands for small - format and foodservice customers with chilled dsd . see note [XX] to our consolidated financial statements for further information . in [XXXX] , we began to distribute hard mtn dew , an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the boston beer company . we have licensed the use of the hard mtn dew trademark to the boston beer company , which has appointed us as their distributor for this product . trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes , and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks . we have authorized , through licensing arrangements , the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments . in addition , we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail , which enhances brand awareness . we either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products , their packaging , the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses . some of these patents are licensed to others . seasonality our businesses are affected by seasonal variations . our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday - related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter . however , taken as a whole , seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results . table of contents our customers our customers include wholesale and other distributors , foodservice customers , grocery stores , drug stores , convenience stores , discount / dollar stores , mass merchandisers , membership stores , hard discounters , e - commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers , among others . we normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area . these arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate , finished goods and aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality . we also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas . we rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer . for our independent distributors and retailers , these incentives include volume - based rebates , product placement fees , promotions and displays . for our independent bottlers , these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs , such as consumer incentives , advertising support , new product support , and vending and cooler equipment placement . consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions , and other promotional offers . advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media . new product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support , such as point - of - purchase materials , product placement fees , media and advertising . vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment . the nature and type of programs vary annually . changes to the retail landscape , including increased consolidation of retail ownership , the continued growth of sales through e - commerce websites and mobile commerce applications , including through subscription services and other direct - to - consumer businesses , the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers , as well as the international expansion of hard discounters , and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers . in [XXXX] , sales to walmart inc . ( walmart ) and its affiliates , including sam ’s club ( sam ’s ) , represented approximately [XX] % of our consolidated net revenue , with sales reported across all of our divisions , including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers , which were used in finished goods sold by them to walmart . the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our flna , qfna and pbna divisions . our competition our beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that , like us , operate in multiple geographies , as well as regional , local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors , including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e - commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally - sourced products . in many countries in which our products are sold , including the united states , the coca - cola company is our primary beverage competitor . other beverage and convenient food competitors include , but are not limited to , campbell soup company , conagra brands , inc . , hormel foods corporation , kellanova , keurig dr pepper inc . , the kraft heinz company , link snacks , inc . , mondelēz international , inc . , monster beverage corporation , nestlé s.a . , red bull gmbh and utz brands , inc . many of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the united states and worldwide . in [XXXX] , we and the coca - cola company represented approximately [XX] % and [XX] % , respectively , of the u.s . liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels ,

occurred and any of which may occur in the future , can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance , which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities . these are not the only risks we face . there may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future . business risks risks associated with the deadly conflict in ukraine the deadly conflict in ukraine and related sanctions have continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty . the conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets , supply chain disruptions , increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our table of contents information systems , reputational risk , heightened risks to employee safety , business disruptions ( including labor shortages ) , significant volatility of the russian ruble , limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services , including working capital facilities , reduced availability and increased costs for transportation , energy , packaging and raw materials and other input costs , environmental , health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities , additional sanctions , export controls and other legislation or regulations ( including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from russia ) . the ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets , including the nationalization or expropriation of assets , result in additional impairment charges or significantly affect our ability to manage our operations in these markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses . we can not predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees , operations , customers , consumers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals . the conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business . reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business . demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences , including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for , purchase and consume them . consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors , including : changes in consumer demographics , consumption patterns , diet ( whether due to changes in consumer behavior and eating habits , the use of weight - loss drugs or other factors ) and channel preferences ( including continued increases in the e - commerce and online - to - offline channels ) ; pricing ; product quality ; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact ( such as single - use and other plastic packaging ) ; and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of , or location of origin of , ingredients or substances in our products or packaging , including due to the results of third - party studies ( whether or not scientifically valid ) . concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products . pandemics , epidemics or other disease outbreaks , such as covid-19 , and geopolitical events , wars and other military conflicts have also impacted and could continue to impact consumer preferences and demand for our products . consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products , the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns , our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer , including through the use of digital media or assets , and the perception of our use of social media and our response to political and social issues , geopolitical events , wars and other military conflicts or catastrophic events . these and other factors have reduced and could continue to reduce consumers ’ willingness to purchase certain of our products , including as a result of public boycotts . any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends , or make the right strategic investments to do so , including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends , can lead to reduced demand for our products , lead to inventory write - offs or erode our competitive and financial position , thereby adversely affecting our business . in addition , our business operations , including our supply chain , are subject to disruption by geopolitical events , wars and other military conflicts , natural disasters , pandemics , epidemics or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues . damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business . maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products . our reputation or brand image has in the past been , and could in the future be , adversely impacted by a variety of factors , including : any failure by us , our business partners , or other actors in the supply chain to maintain high ethical , business and environmental , social and governance practices , including with respect to human rights , child labor , diversity , equity and inclusion , workplace conditions and employee health and safety ; any failure , or table of contents perception of a failure , to achieve our environmental , social and governance goals , or any negative perception toward such goals , including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products , diversity , equity and inclusion initiatives , packaging , water use and our impact on the environment ; any failure to address health or other concerns about our products , products we distribute ( including alcoholic beverages ) , or particular ingredients in our products , including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity and other health conditions or an increase in public health costs ; our research and development efforts ; any product quality or safety issues , including the recall of any of our products ; any failure to comply with laws and regulations ; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns , sponsorship arrangements , marketing programs , use of social media and our response to political and social issues , geopolitical events , wars and other military conflicts or catastrophic events ; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing . damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products , thereby adversely affecting our business . product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business . we have recalled , and could in the future recall , products due to product quality or safety issues , including actual or alleged mislabeling , misbranding , spoilage , undeclared allergens , adulteration or contamination . joint ventures in which we have an interest have also recalled , and could in the future recall , products for the same or other reasons . product recalls , including the voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals in our qfna division ( quaker recall ) , have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost , the destruction of product inventory , customer fines and returns or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time . in addition , product quality or safety issues have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products , cause production and delivery disruptions , including as a result of temporary or permanent closure of manufacturing plants or facilities , and result in increased costs ( including payment of fines and/or judgments , cleaning and remediation costs and legal fees , and costs associated with alternative sources of production ) and damage our reputation ( or the reputation of joint ventures in which we have an interest ) , particularly as we or our joint ventures continue to expand into new categories , all of which can adversely affect our business . any perception or allegation ( whether or not valid ) of failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls , litigation , government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings , all of which may result in fines , penalties , damages or criminal liability . our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality , safety and integrity generally , even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio . in addition , while we currently maintain insurance coverage that , subject to its terms and conditions , is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of product recalls , this insurance coverage may not , depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident , cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident , or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident . any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business . our products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that , like us , operate in multiple geographies , as well as regional , local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors , including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e - commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products . in many countries in which our products are sold , including the united states , the coca - cola company is our primary beverage competitor . our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty , taste , price , value , quality , product variety , innovation , distribution , shelf space , advertising , marketing and promotional activity , packaging , convenience , service and the ability to table of contents anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends . our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market new products , if we are unable to effectively adopt new technologies , including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies , if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our capabilities in digital marketing , if our competitors spend more aggressively or effectively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to supply disruptions , pricing pressure ( including as a result of commodity inflation ) or otherwise compete effectively , and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital , marketing or other expenditures . failure to attract , develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce can have an adverse effect on our business . our business requires that we attract , develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce . our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract , retain , develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization . our ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market , which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation , labor shortages , increased employee turnover , changes in availability of our workforce and changing worker expectations regarding flexible work models . any unplanned turnover , sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions , including the chief executive officer , or failure to attract , develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce , including with key capabilities such as e - commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills , can deplete our institutional knowledge base , erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees , higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs . in addition , failure to attract , retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation . any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business . water scarcity can adversely affect our business . we and our business partners use water in the manufacturing of our products . water is also essential to the production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process . lack of available water of acceptable quality , actions by governmental and non - governmental organizations , investors , customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress , including due to the effects of climate change , can lead to : supply chain disruption ; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners ; higher compliance costs ; increased capital expenditures ( including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption ) ; higher production costs , including less favorable pricing for water ; the interruption or cessation of operations at , or relocation of , our facilities or the facilities of our business partners ; failure to achieve our goals relating to water use ; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity ; or damage to our reputation , any of which can adversely affect our business . changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business . the retail landscape continues to evolve , including continued growth in e - commerce channels and hard discounters . our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e - commerce retailers and hard discounters , while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels ( many of whom are also focused on increasing their e - commerce sales ) . our business can be adversely affected if e - commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow table of contents their businesses . in addition , our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct - to - consumer e - commerce capabilities . the retail industry is also impacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers , including as a result of increased consolidation of ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power , particularly in north america , europe and latin america . in this changing retail landscape , retailers and buying groups have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to compete in these jurisdictions by demanding lower prices or increased promotional programs , removing our products or otherwise reducing shelf space allocated to our products . the increasing power of retailers and consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers ’ ability to compete effectively , resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products . further , we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers , including walmart , to compete effectively . our inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers , a change in the business condition ( financial or otherwise ) of any of our key customers , even if unrelated to us , a significant reduction in sales to any key customer , or the loss of any of our key customers has adversely affected and c an continue to adversely affect our business . disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain , including continued increased commodity , packaging , transportation , labor and other input costs , can adversely affect our business . we have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain . many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing war and other military conflict , acts of terrorism , civil unrest , political instability or unfavorable economic conditions . natural disasters and extreme weather conditions also pose physical risks to our facilities , which could impair our production capabilities and disrupt our supply chain . some raw materials and supplies , including packaging materials , are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak . there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to mitigate disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture , production and distribution of our products or from operational or financial instability of our key suppliers . any sustained or significant disruption in the future to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply , which can adversely impact our business . the raw materials and other supplies , including agricultural commodities , fuel and packaging materials , such as recycled pet , transportation , labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing , production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors , including changes in supply and demand , supplier capacity constraints , inflation , weather conditions ( including potential effects of climate change ) , fire , natural disasters , disease or pests ( including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry ) , agricultural uncertainty , health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks ( including covid-19 ) , labor shortages or changes in availability of our or our business partners ’ workforce ( including the lack of availability of truck drivers as a result of covid-19 ) , strikes or work stoppages ( including by railway workers or other third parties involved in the manufacture , production and distribution of our products ) , governmental incentives and controls ( including import / export restrictions , such as new or increased tariffs , sanctions , quotas or trade barriers ) , port congestions or delays , transport capacity constraints , cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions , loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites , political uncertainties , geopolitical events , wars and other military conflicts , acts of terrorism , governmental instability or currency exchange rates . many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation . we continued to experience table of contents increased commodity , packaging and transportation costs during [XXXX] , which may continue . when input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly , we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume , revenue , margins and operating results . political , social and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business . political , social and geopolitical conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict , resulting in adverse effects on our business . the results of elections , referendums or other political conditions ( including government shutdowns ) , geopolitical events , wars and other military conflicts ( such as the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east ) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws , regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws , regulations , programs or policies may change , including with respect to tariffs , sanctions , environmental and climate change regulations , taxes , benefit programs , the movement of goods , services and people between countries , relationships between countries , customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters , and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation , volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products , any of which can adversely affect our business . in addition , political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the united states as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests , including in connection with political elections , civil rights and liberties and geopolitical events . our operations or the operations of our business partners , including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products , may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time , including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions , which can adversely affect our business . our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets . our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets , including brazil , china , mexico , russia and south africa . there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market , due to competition , price , cultural differences , consumer preferences , regulation , method of distribution or otherwise . our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic , political and social conditions ; geopolitical conflicts , acts of war , terrorist acts , and civil unrest , including demonstrations and protests ; competition ; tariffs , sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets ; foreign ownership restrictions ; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners ; government - mandated closure , or threatened closure , of our operations or the operations of our business partners ; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products ; highly inflationary economies ; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency ; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries , currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions , which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries , from time to time , or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses ; the lack of well - established or reliable legal systems ; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and u.s . laws and regulations that apply to our international operations , including the foreign corrupt practices act , the u.k . bribery act and the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act ; and adverse consequences , such as the assessment of fines or penalties , for any failure to comply with laws and regulations . our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets , effectively operate , or manage the risks associated with operating , in these markets , or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets . table of contents changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business . many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions , such as high inflation and adverse changes in interest rates , tax laws or tax rates , including as a result of geopolitical events . these uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions have resulted in and could continue to result in recessions or economic slowdowns ; volatile commodity markets ; labor shortages ; highly inflationary economies , devaluation , fluctuation or demonetization of currency ; contraction in the availability of credit ; austerity or stimulus measures ; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold ; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post - retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post - retirement plans . in addition , we can not predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners , including financial institutions with whom we do business , and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business . future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business . we depend on information systems and technology , including public websites and cloud - based services , for many activities important to our business , including communications within our company , interfacing with customers and consumers ; ordering and managing inventory ; managing and operating our facilities ; protecting confidential information , including personal data we collect ; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory , financial reporting , legal and tax requirements . our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns , degraded systems performance , systems disruptions or security incidents . these disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents , network or power outages , software , equipment or telecommunications failures , the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors , natural disasters , fires or other catastrophic events . in addition , the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure , which can be subject to failure , disruption or unavailability , and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents . cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently , the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data , disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives . in addition , the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may increase our cybersecurity risks , including generative artificial intelligence augmenting threat actors ’ technological sophistication to enhance existing or create new malware . cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion , denial of service , social engineering , introduction of viruses or malware ( such as ransomware ) , exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware , software or other infrastructure , hacking , website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials , unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise . as with other global companies , we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents , including the types of attacks and incidents described above . continued geopolitical instability has heightened the risk of cyberattacks . if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure , or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents , our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected , which has resulted in and can continue to result in some or all of the following : transaction errors , processing inefficiencies , inability to access our data or systems , lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices , plants , warehouses , distribution centers or other facilities , table of contents intellectual property or other data loss , litigation , claims , legal or regulatory proceedings , inquiries or investigations , fines or penalties , remediation costs , damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or potential customers . in addition , these risks also exist in acquired businesses , joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems . similar risks exist with respect to our business partners and third - party providers , including suppliers , software and cloud - based service providers , that we rely upon for aspects of various business processes and activities , including procurement , supply chain , manufacturing , distribution , information technology support services and administrative functions ( including payroll processing , health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions ) and the systems managed , hosted , provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors . for example , malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware and exploit known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of our vendors and third - party service providers . the need to coordinate with various third - party service providers , including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident , may complicate our efforts to address issues that arise . as a result , we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third - party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information . although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business , such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future . while we believe we devote significant resources to network security , disaster recovery , employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data , there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents , systems disruptions , system compromises or misuses of data . in addition , while we currently maintain insurance coverage that , subject to its terms and conditions , is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures , this insurance coverage may not , depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident , cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident , or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident . failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business . we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions , joint ventures , distribution agreements , divestitures , refranchisings and other strategic transactions . the success of these transactions is dependent upon , among other things , our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns , benefits , cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction , within the anticipated time frame , or at all ; and receipt of necessary consents , clearances and approvals . risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing , distribution , sales , accounting , financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel , activities and systems in connection with divestitures ; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories ; motivating , recruiting and retaining executives and key employees ; conforming controls ( including internal control over financial reporting , disclosure controls and procedures and data protection and cybersecurity ) and policies ( including with respect to environmental compliance , health and safety compliance and compliance with anti - bribery laws ) ; retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers ; managing tax costs or inefficiencies ; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain ; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses ; recognition of impairment charges in connection with potential divestitures ; managing the impact of business table of contents decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do ; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities , such as contingent liabilities and litigation . strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively , or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions , have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business . our reliance on third - party service providers and enterprise - wide systems can have an adverse effect on our business . we rely on third - party service providers , including software and cloud data service providers , for certain areas of our business , including procurement , supply chain , manufacturing , distribution , information technology support services and administrative functions ( such as payroll processing , health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions ) . failure by these third parties to meet their contractual , regulatory and other obligations to us , or our failure to adequately monitor their performance , has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers . depending on the function involved , such errors can also lead to business disruption , systems performance degradation , processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions , the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise , incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting , litigation , claims , legal or regulatory proceedings , inquiries or investigations , fines or penalties , remediation costs , damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale , all of which can adversely affect our business . in addition , we continue on our multi - year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems , including our financial processing systems , to enterprise - wide systems solutions and have deployed these systems in certain countries and divisions . we have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies following these planned implementations . in addition , if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure , or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative , our business could be adversely affected . climate change or measures to address climate change and other sustainability matters can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation . climate change may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions , including rising temperatures and drought . natural disasters and extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities , impair our production capabilities , disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products . in addition , climate change or other weather - related disruptions to our supply chain may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products , such as potatoes , sugar cane , corn , wheat , rice , oats , oranges and other commodities . also , there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made , manufactured , distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change , biodiversity loss , deforestation , regulating greenhouse gas emissions , energy policies and sustainability , including single - use plastics . this increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements , such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product labeling requirements or other regulatory measures , which could , along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals , continue to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment . as a result , the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations . in addition , working toward achieving our sustainability goals will require significant effort and resources from us and other stakeholders , such as our suppliers and other third parties , governmental entities , and the development of technology that may not currently exist or exist at scale . lack of progress or failure to properly report on our goals with respect to reducing our impact on table of contents the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change and other sustainability matters , including the use of single - use plastics , can lead to adverse publicity , which could result in reduced demand for our products , damage to our reputation or increase the risk of litigation , regulatory proceedings , inquiries or investigations . any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business . strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer . many of our employees and employees of third parties that are involved in the manufacturing , production or distribution of our products are covered by collective bargaining agreements , and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements . strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we or the third parties that are involved in the manufacturing , production and distribution of our products are unable to renew , or enter into new , collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products , interrupt product supply , lead to a loss of sales , increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy , all of which can adversely affect our business . financial risks failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely affect our financial performance . our future growth depends , in part , on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies , including our multi - year phased implementation of shared business service organizational models . we continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long - term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure , improve decision - making and operate more efficiently . some of these measures result in unintended consequences , such as business disruptions , distraction of management and employees , reduced morale and productivity , unexpected employee attrition , an inability to attract or retain key personnel and negative publicity . if we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives , we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits , resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance . a deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business or investments can result in impairment charges that adversely affect our results of operations . we conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite - lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred . in addition , amortizable intangible assets , equity method investments , equity investments without readily determinable fair values , investments in available - for - sale debt securities , property , plant and equipment and other long - lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment . our equity method investees also perform similar impairment tests and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them , adjusted for the impact of items such as basis differences and deferred taxes , as appropriate . a deterioration in our underlying assumptions , or those of our equity method investees , regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions , geopolitical conditions ( including the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east ) , macroeconomic conditions , including the interest rate environment , or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets , including any deterioration in the weighted - average cost of capital based on market data available at the time , as well as our ability to hold the investment until recovery of fair value to amortized cost for available - for - sale debt securities , have resulted and could in the future result in an impairment charge , thereby adversely affecting our results of operations . table of contents fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance . because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s . dollars , the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the united states , where the functional currency is other than the u.s . dollar , are translated into u.s . dollars . given our global operations , we also pay for the ingredients , raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies . fluctuations in exchange rates , including as a result of inflation , central bank monetary policies , currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions or geopolitical instability have had , and could continue to have , an adverse impact on our financial performance . our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings . rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors , including our cash generating capability , levels of indebtedness , policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally , as well as factors beyond our control , such as the state of the economy and our industry . we expect to maintain tier [X] commercial paper access , which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates . any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings , especially any downgrade to below investment grade , can increase our future borrowing costs , impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all , result in a reduction in our liquidity , or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically ( and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing ) , all of which can adversely affect our financial performance . legal , tax and regulatory risks taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance . certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed , or are considering imposing , new or increased taxes on the manufacture , distribution or sale of certain of our products , particularly our beverages , as a result of ingredients contained in our products . these taxes vary in scope and form : some apply to all beverages , including non - caloric beverages , while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener ( e.g. , sugar ) . similarly , some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce / liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar ( or other sweetener ) , some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar ( or other sweetener ) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar ( or other sweetener ) . for example , romania enacted a graduated tax on all non - alcoholic beverages , effective january [X] , [XXXX] , at a rate of [X.X] romanian leu ( [X.XX] u.s . dollars ) per liter for drinks with a sugar content between [X] - [X] g per 100ml and [X.X] romanian leu ( [X.XX] u.s . dollars ) per liter for drinks with a sugar content between above [X] g per 100ml . these tax measures , whatever their scope or form , have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products , reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity , resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance . limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance . certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed , or are considering imposing , limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products or product packaging . these limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product or product packaging , warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products , restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold , limit the location in which our products may be available or discontinue the use of certain ingredients or packaging . for table of contents example , colombia enacted warning labeling requirements effective in [XXXX] to indicate whether a particular pre - packaged food product contains any amount of sweeteners or is considered to be high in added sugar , sodium , saturated fat or trans - fat . certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color - coded labeling requirements where colors such as red , yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient , such as sugar , sodium or saturated fat , in products . the imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past reduced and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products , lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs , resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance . laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business and financial performance . we rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers . certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable , commercially compostable , biodegradable or reusable . however , not all packaging is recovered , whether due to lack of infrastructure , improper disposal or otherwise , and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable , commercially compostable , biodegradable or reusable . packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity , litigation , government investigations or other action or reduced consumer demand for our products , adversely affecting our financial performance . many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing laws , regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging , waste reduction , increased recycling rates or decreased use of single - use plastics or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging . these laws , regulations and policies vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies , plastic or packaging taxes , minimum recycled content requirements , restrictions on certain products and materials , requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles , restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging , including single - use plastics and packaging containing pfas , restrictions on labeling related to recyclability , requirements to charge deposit fees and requirements to scale reusable or refillable packaging . for example , the european union , peru , south africa and certain states in the united states , among other jurisdictions , have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions . these laws and regulations have in the past increased and could continue to increase the cost of our products , impact demand for our products , result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners , including our independent bottlers , to increase capital expenditures to invest in reducing the amount of virgin plastic or other materials used in our packaging , to develop alternative packaging or to revise product labeling , all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance . failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business . we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws . these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or , within the united states , from state to state , and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements . our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations , including the california consumer privacy act , which was significantly modified by the california privacy rights act , as well as comprehensive privacy legislation in virginia , colorado , utah and connecticut that became effective in [XXXX] , as well as the european union ’s general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) , the u.k . general data protection regulation ( which implements the gdpr into u.k . law ) and china ’s personal information protection act , impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time , particularly as additional jurisdictions continue to adopt similar regulations . failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from table of contents unauthorized access , use or other processing , have in the past and could in the future result in litigation , claims , legal or regulatory proceedings , inquiries or investigations , damage to our reputation , fines or penalties , all of which can adversely affect our business . increases in income tax rates , changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our financial performance . increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws , including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced , can adversely affect our financial performance . for example , economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes , including the united states , have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation . for example , numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the organization for economic co - operation and development model ( oecd ) rules that propose a partial global profit reallocation and a global minimum tax rate of [XX] % . certain countries , including european union member states , have enacted or are expected to enact legislation incorporating the global minimum tax with effect as early as [XXXX] and widespread implementation of a global minimum tax is expected by [XXXX] . as the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business , our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes . this increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty , resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance . we are also subject to regular reviews , examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non - income based taxes . economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate , or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation , has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals , resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance . if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights , or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others , our business can be adversely affected . we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business , including ingredient formulas , trademarks , copyrights , patents , business processes and other trade secrets . the laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property . our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property , including our ingredient formulas , or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property . also , in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products , we have in the past been alleged to have infringed , and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe , on the intellectual property rights of others . such infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages , damage to our reputation , disruption to our operations , injunctions against development , manufacturing , use and/or sale of certain products , inventory write - offs or other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products , resulting in an adverse effect on our business . failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business . the conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production , storage , distribution , sale , display , advertising , marketing , labeling , content ( including whether a product contains genetically engineered ingredients ) , quality , safety , transportation , supply chain , traceability , sourcing ( including pesticide use ) , packaging , disposal , recycling and use of our products or raw materials , employment and occupational health and safety , environmental , social and governance matters and reporting ( including climate change ) , machine learning and artificial intelligence and data privacy and table of contents protection . in addition , in many jurisdictions , compliance with competition and antitrust laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position , as is compliance with anti - corruption laws . the imposition of new laws , changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof , changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators , and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made , manufactured , distributed or sold , have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs , capital expenditures and higher production costs , or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products , resulting in adverse effects on our business . for example , increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental , social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements , including expanded disclosure requirements that are expected to continue to expand the nature , scope and complexity of matters on which we are required to report . in addition , the entry into new markets or categories has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional regulations resulting in higher compliance costs . if one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture , distribution or sale of our products , other jurisdictions may follow . failure to comply with such laws or regulations ( or allegations thereof ) can subject us to criminal or civil investigations or enforcement actions , including voluntary and involuntary document requests , fines , injunctions , product recalls , penalties , disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions , all of which can adversely affect our business . in addition , the results of third - party studies ( whether or not scientifically valid ) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits that can adversely affect our business . potential liabilities and costs from litigation , claims , legal or regulatory proceedings , inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business . we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation , claims , legal or regulatory proceedings , inquiries and investigations , including but not limited to matters related to our advertising , marketing or commercial practices , product labels , claims and ingredients , personal injury and property damage , intellectual property rights , privacy , employment , tax and insurance matters , environmental , social and governance matters , including concerns or perceptions regarding our packaging and its environmental impact , and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations . these matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters . responding to these matters , even those that are ultimately non - meritorious , requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources , and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image . any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business ."

's fiscal years ended may [XX] , [XXXX] , [XXXX] , [XXXX] and [XXXX] , respectively . any references to other fiscal years refer to a fiscal year ending on may [XX] of that year . products our nike brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on men 's , women 's and kids ' . we also design products specifically for the jordan brand and converse . we believe this approach allows us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities . nike 's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use , although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes . we place considerable emphasis on innovation and high - quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products . our men 's , women 's and jordan brand footwear products currently lead in footwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so . we also sell sports apparel , which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear . our sports apparel , similar to our athletic footwear products , is designed primarily for athletic use , although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes , and demonstrates our commitment to innovation and high - quality construction . our men 's and women 's apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect them to continue to do so . we often market footwear , apparel and accessories in "" collections "" of similar use or by category . we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos . we sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the nike brand name , including bags , socks , sport balls , eyewear , timepieces , digital devices , bats , gloves , protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities . we also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly - owned subsidiary , nike ihm , inc . , doing business as air manufacturing innovation . our jordan brand designs , distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear , apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball performance and culture using the jumpman trademark . sales and operating results for jordan brand products are reported within the respective nike brand geographic operating segments . our wholly - owned subsidiary brand , converse , headquartered in boston , massachusetts , designs , distributes and licenses casual sneakers , apparel and accessories under the converse , chuck taylor , all star , one star , star chevron and jack purcell trademarks . operating results of the converse brand are reported on a stand - alone basis . in addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our nike direct operations , we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell , using nike - owned trademarks , certain apparel , digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities . [XXXX] form [XX] - k [X] we also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms , including fitness and activity apps ; sport , fitness and wellness content ; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience . sales and marketing we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year . historically , revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters . however , the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear , apparel and equipment , as well as other macroeconomic , strategic , operating and logistics - related factors . because nike is a consumer products company , the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities , as well as changing design trends , affect the demand for our products . we must , therefore , respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings , developing new products , styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing . failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability . this is a continuing risk . refer to item 1a . risk factors . our markets we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization . each nike brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry : the design , development , marketing and selling of athletic footwear , apparel and equipment . the company 's reportable operating segments for the nike brand are : north america ; europe , middle east & africa ( "" emea "" ) ; greater china ; and asia pacific & latin america ( "" apla "" ) , and include results for the nike and jordan brands . sales through our nike direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment . converse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry : the design , marketing , licensing and selling of casual sneakers , apparel and accessories . converse direct to consumer operations , including digital commerce , are reported within the converse operating segment results . united states market for fiscal [XXXX] , nike brand and converse sales in the united states accounted for approximately [XX] % of total revenues , compared to [XX] % and [XX] % for fiscal [XXXX] and fiscal [XXXX] , respectively . we sell our products to thousands of retail accounts in the united states , including a mix of footwear stores , sporting goods stores , athletic specialty stores , department stores , skate , tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts . in the united states , we utilize nike sales offices to solicit such sales . during fiscal [XXXX] , our three largest united states customers accounted for approximately [XX] % of sales in the united states . our nike direct and converse direct to consumer operations sell our products to consumers through various digital platforms . in addition , our nike direct and converse direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the united states : # # table_start u.s . retail stores number nike brand factory stores [XXX] nike brand in - line stores ( including employee - only stores ) [XX] converse stores ( including factory stores ) [XX] total [XXX] # # table_end in the united states , nike has eight significant distribution centers . refer to item [X] . properties for further information .

fit , flyknit , flyease , zoomx , air max , react and forward technologies , among others , typifies our dedication to designing innovative products . manufacturing nearly all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the united states by independent manufacturers ( "" contract manufacturers "" ) , many of which operate multiple factories . we are also supplied , primarily indirectly , by a number of materials , or "" tier [X] "" suppliers , who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products . as of may [XX] , [XXXX] , we had [XXX] strategic tier [X] suppliers . as of may [XX] , [XXXX] , our contract manufacturers operated [XXX] finished goods footwear factories located in [XX] countries . for fiscal [XXXX] , nike brand footwear finished goods were manufactured by [XX] contract manufacturers , many of which operate multiple factories . the largest single finished goods footwear factory accounted for approximately [X] % of total fiscal [XXXX] nike brand footwear production . for fiscal [XXXX] , factories in vietnam , indonesia and china manufactured approximately [XX] % , [XX] % and [XX] % of total nike brand footwear , respectively . for fiscal [XXXX] , four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than [XX] % of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately [XX] % of nike brand footwear production . as of may [XX] , [XXXX] , our contract manufacturers operated [XXX] finished goods apparel factories located in [XX] countries . for fiscal [XXXX] , nike brand apparel finished goods were manufactured by [XX] contract manufacturers , many of which operate multiple factories . the largest single finished goods apparel factory accounted for approximately [X] % of total fiscal [XXXX] nike brand apparel production . for fiscal [XXXX] , factories in vietnam , china and cambodia manufactured approximately [XX] % , [XX] % and [XX] % [XXXX] form [XX] - k [X] of total nike brand apparel , respectively . for fiscal [XXXX] , one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than [XX] % of apparel production , and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately [XX] % of nike brand apparel production . nike 's contract manufacturers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear , apparel and equipment products . most raw materials are available and purchased by those contract manufacturers in the countries where manufacturing takes place . the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber , plastic compounds , foam cushioning materials , natural and synthetic leather , nylon , polyester and natural fiber textiles , as well as polyurethane films used to make nike air - sole cushioning components . during fiscal [XXXX] , air manufacturing innovation , a wholly - owned subsidiary , with facilities near beaverton , oregon , in dong nai province , vietnam , and st . charles , missouri , as well as contract manufacturers in china and vietnam , were our suppliers of nike air - sole cushioning components used in footwear . the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics , yarns and threads ( both virgin and recycled ) ; specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body , retain heat and repel rain and/or snow ; and plastic and metal hardware . in fiscal [XXXX] , we experienced ongoing supply chain volatility during the first part of the year , which improved gradually during the course of the year . we also experienced higher supply chain network costs primarily due to inflationary pressures during the year . despite competition for certain materials during fiscal [XXXX] , contract manufacturers were able to source sufficient quantities of raw materials for use in our footwear and apparel products . refer to item 1a . risk factors , for additional discussion of the impact of sourcing risks on our business . since [XXXX] , sojitz corporation of america ( "" sojitz america "" ) , a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock , has performed import - export financing services for us . international operations and trade our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad , such as the implementation of , or potential changes in , foreign and domestic trade policies , increases in import duties , anti - dumping measures , quotas , safeguard measures , trade restrictions , restrictions on the transfer of funds and , in certain parts of the world , political tensions , instability , conflicts , nationalism and terrorism , and resulting sanctions and other measures imposed in response to such issues . we have not , to date , been materially affected by any such risk but can not predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future . in recent years , uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world . these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors , and the footwear and apparel industries , as a whole , are not immune . companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions , and , in nearly all cases , we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry , while observing applicable competition laws . notwithstanding our efforts , protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products , and additional measures , if implemented , could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for nike , as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole . we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry , and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions . we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti - dumping measures and could affect our industry . we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear , apparel and equipment . nike also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements . changes in , and responses to , u.s . trade policies , including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries , have negatively affected , and could in the future negatively affect , u.s . corporations , including nike , with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries , which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business , either of which may have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition or our results of operations . in addition , with respect to proposed trade restrictions , we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented ( i ) addresses legitimate and core concerns , ( ii ) is consistent with international trade rules and ( iii ) reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community . where trade protection measures are implemented , we believe we have the ability to develop , over a period of time , adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers . if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country , our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact . however , we believe we could abate any such disruption , and that much of the adverse impact on supply would , therefore , be of a short - term nature , although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost - effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability .

sport , fitness and wellness content and services ; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience . product offerings , technologies , marketing expenditures ( including expenditures for advertising and endorsements ) , pricing , costs of production , customer service , digital commerce platforms , digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition . these , in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology , a reduction in barriers to the creation of new footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear , apparel , and equipment , services and experiences , constitute significant risk factors in our operations . in addition , the competitive nature of retail , including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop , and the continued proliferation of digital commerce , constitutes a risk factor implicating our nike direct and wholesale operations . if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors , our costs may increase , demand for our products may decline , possibly significantly , or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products . [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] economic factors beyond our control , and changes in the global economic environment , including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates , could result in lower revenues , higher costs and decreased margins and earnings . a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states , and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies , which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions , including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates . central banks may deploy various strategies to combat inflation , including increasing interest rates , which may impact our borrowing costs . additionally , there has been , and may continue to be , volatility in currency exchange rates that impact the u.s . dollar value relative to other international currencies . our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies , and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations , specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into u.s . dollars for consolidated financial reporting , as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s . dollar adversely affects the u.s . dollar value of the company 's foreign currency - denominated sales and earnings . currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance . foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition . we hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay , but not to completely eliminate , the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results . since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility , they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger u.s . dollar or other trading currency , but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker u.s . dollar or other trading currency . our future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the u.s . dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business . the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities . we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers . we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer 's financial condition , generally without requiring collateral . to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products , we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program . these advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions , and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty . in the past , some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies , which have had an adverse effect on our sales , our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition . when the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts , retailers tend to be more cautious with orders . a slowing or changing economy in our key markets , including a recession , could adversely affect the financial health of our customers , which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition . in addition , product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers , which requires continuing investments by retailers . retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them , resulting in lower sales and orders for our products . climate change and other sustainability - related matters , or legal , regulatory or market responses thereto , may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations . there are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused , and may continue to cause , potentially at a growing rate , increases in global temperatures , changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extreme weather and climate events . climate change may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials , including those used in the production of our products , and may result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences , which could in turn affect our business , operating results and financial condition . for example , there has been increased focus by governmental and non - governmental organizations , consumers , customers , employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability matters , including responsible sourcing and deforestation , the use of plastic , energy and water , the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and materials transparency , any of which may require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency , due diligence and reporting . in addition , federal , state or local governmental authorities in various countries have proposed , and are likely to continue to propose , legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment . various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change , which could increase the complexity of , and potential cost related to complying with , such regulations . any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment , may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our products or the demand for our products , and , in turn , may adversely impact our business , operating results and financial condition . although we have announced sustainability - related goals and targets , there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategies , and any perception , whether or not valid , that we have failed to achieve , or to act responsibly with respect to , such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change , could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation . execution of these strategies and achievement of our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties , many of which are outside of our control . these risks and uncertainties include , but are not [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] limited to , our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes ; the availability and cost of raw materials and renewable energy ; unforeseen production , design , operational and technological difficulties ; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments , including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes ; compliance with , and changes or additions to , global and regional regulations , taxes , charges , mandates or requirements relating to greenhouse gas emissions , carbon costs or climate - related goals ; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions ; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures . as a result , there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our sustainability - related goals , which could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition . given the broad and global scope of our operations , we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change , such as shifts in weather patterns . extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores , suppliers , manufacturers , customers , distribution centers , offices , headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition . moreover , natural disasters such as earthquakes , hurricanes , wildfires , tsunamis , floods or droughts , whether occurring in the united states or abroad , and their related consequences and effects , including energy shortages and public health issues , have in the past temporarily disrupted , and could in the future disrupt , our operations , the operations of our vendors , manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in , and in the future could result in , economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition . in particular , if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers , manufacturers , employees , customers , distribution centers or vendors are located , our continued success would depend , in part , on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties ' computer , network , telecommunication and other systems and operations . in addition , a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending , any of which could in turn result in negative point - of - sale trends for our merchandise . further , climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters , which may affect our business operations , either in a particular region or globally , as well as the activities of our third - party vendors and other suppliers , manufacturers and customers . we believe the diversity of locations in which we operate , our operational size , disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks , including the internet and third - party services ( "" information technology systems "" ) , position us well , but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities . if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events , we could experience operational challenges , in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations , such as key executive officers or personnel . for example , our world headquarters is located in an active seismic zone , which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects . further , if we are unable to find alternative suppliers , replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our information technology systems or supply systems , we could be late in delivering , or be unable to deliver , products to our customers . these events could result in reputational damage , lost sales , cancellation charges or markdowns , all of which could have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . our financial condition and results of operations have been , and could in the future be , adversely affected by a pandemic , epidemic or other public health emergency . pandemics , including the covid-19 pandemic , and other public health emergencies , and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate such crises have caused , and may in the future cause , business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets , both globally and in the united states . these events have led to and could again lead to adverse impacts to our global supply chain , factory cancellation costs , store closures , and a decline in retail traffic and discretionary spending by consumers and , in turn , materially impact our business , sales , financial condition and results of operations as well as cause a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our jurisdictions . we can not predict whether , and to what degree , our sales , operations and financial results could in the future be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures . risks presented by pandemics and other public health emergencies include , but are not limited to : • deterioration in economic conditions in the united states and globally , including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our consumers and vendors ; • disruption to our distribution centers , contract manufacturers , finished goods factories and other vendors , through the effects of facility closures , increased operating costs , reductions in operating hours , labor shortages , and real time changes in operating procedures , such as additional cleaning and disinfection procedures , which have had , and could in the future again have , a significant impact on our planned inventory production and distribution , including higher inventory levels or inventory shortages in various markets ; [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] • impacts to our distribution and logistics providers ' ability to operate , including labor and container shortages , and increases in their operating costs . these supply chain effects have had , and could in the future have , an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand , including digital demand , and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in extended inventory transit times and an increase in our costs of production and distribution , including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses ; • decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures , reduced operating hours , social distancing restrictions and/or changes in consumer behavior ; • reduced consumer demand for our products , including as a result of a rise in unemployment rates , higher costs of borrowing , inflation and diminished consumer confidence ; • cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries , and bans on large public gatherings , which have reduced and in the future could reduce consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers ; • the risk that any safety protocols in nike - owned or affiliated facilities , including our offices , will not be effective or not be perceived as effective , or that any virus - related illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities , whether accurate or not ; • incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements , including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer , rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols , conducting temperature checks , testing and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of surfaces ; • bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers , which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us , or result in revised payment terms , cancellation or reduction of their orders ; and • significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets , which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future . we can not reasonably predict the ultimate impact of any pandemic or public health emergency , including the extent of any adverse impact on our business , results of operations and financial condition , which will depend on , among other things , the duration and spread of the pandemic or public health emergency , the impact of governmental regulations that have been , and may continue to be , imposed in response , the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak , the availability , safety and efficacy of vaccines , including against emerging variants of the infectious disease , and global economic conditions . additionally , disruptions have in the past made it more challenging to compare our performance , including our revenue growth and overall profitability , across quarters and fiscal years , and could have this effect in the future . any pandemic or public health emergency may also affect our business , results of operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks and may also exacerbate , or occur concurrently with , other risks discussed in this item 1a . risk factors , any of which could have a material effect on us . business and operational risks failure to maintain our reputation , brand image and culture could negatively impact our business . our iconic brands have worldwide recognition , and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation . maintaining , promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts , including advertising and consumer campaigns , product innovation and product quality . our commitment to product innovation , quality and sustainability , and our continuing investment in design ( including materials ) , marketing and sustainability measures may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation . in addition , our success in maintaining , extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media and digital environment , including our reliance on social media and other digital advertising networks , and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences and products . we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives . our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity , purpose and brand culture . negative claims or publicity involving us , our culture and values , our products , services and experiences , consumer data , or any of our key employees , endorsers , sponsors , suppliers or partners could seriously damage our reputation and brand image , regardless of whether such claims are accurate . for example , while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations , we do not control their practices . negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand . further , our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of , association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes , as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct , or change , certain of our activities in response to such considerations . social media , which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity , can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims . adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us , or by us , could also damage our reputation and brand image , undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long - term demand for our products , even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations . if [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] the reputation , culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity , then our sales , financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected . our business is affected by seasonality , which could result in fluctuations in our operating results . we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year . historically , revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters . however , the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our business and seasonal or geographic demand for particular types of footwear , apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events , such as the nba finals , olympics or the world cup , among others . in addition , our customers may cancel orders , change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice . as a result , we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales . accordingly , our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period . this seasonality , along with other factors that are beyond our control , including economic conditions , changes in consumer preferences , weather conditions , outbreaks of disease , social or political unrest , availability of import quotas , transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations , has in the past adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate . our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control , including manufacturing and transportation costs , shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends , all of which we expect to continue . results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period . if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products , we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits . our success depends on our ability to identify , originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate , gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner . however , lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences . all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that can not be predicted with certainty . our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether , and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes . if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings , developing new products , designs , styles and categories , and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing , we could experience lower sales , excess inventories or lower profit margins , any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition . in addition , we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns , including social media and other digital advertising networks . if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase , these factors could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition and results of operations . we rely on technical innovation and high - quality products to compete in the market for our products . technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear , apparel , equipment and other products and services are essential to the commercial success of our products and development of new products . research and development play a key role in technical innovation . we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics , chemistry , exercise physiology , engineering , digital technologies , industrial design , sustainability and related fields , as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes , coaches , trainers , equipment managers , orthopedists , podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting - edge performance products . while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance and reduce injury and maximize comfort , if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products , consumer demand for our products could decline , and if we experience problems with the quality of our products , we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence . failure to continue to obtain or maintain high - quality endorsers of our products could harm our business . we establish relationships with professional athletes , sports teams and leagues , as well as other public figures , including artists , designers and influencers , to develop , evaluate and promote our products , as well as establish product authenticity with consumers . however , as competition in our industry has increased , the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased , and competition to attract and retain high - quality endorsers has increased . if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes , sports teams and leagues , or other public figures , or to do so at a reasonable cost , we could lose the high visibility or on - field authenticity associated with our products , and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments . as a result , our brands , net revenues , expenses and profitability could be harmed . furthermore , if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements , our business could be adversely affected . in addition , actions taken or statements made by athletes , teams or leagues , or other endorsers , associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes , teams or leagues , or endorsers , or our decisions to cease collaborating with certain endorsers in light of actions taken or statements made by them , have in the past harmed and could in the future seriously harm our brand image with consumers and , as a result , could have an adverse effect on [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] our sales and financial condition . poor or non - performance by our endorsers , a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes , public figures or sports organizations , to use and endorse our products and brand or a failure to enter into cost - effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes , public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand , sales and profitability . failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages , which could result in decreased operating margins , reduced cash flows and harm to our business . to meet anticipated demand for our products , we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders , which we hold in inventory and resell to customers . there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers . inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write - downs , and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results , financial condition and cash flows . conversely , if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them , we may experience inventory shortages . inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers , negatively impact retailer , distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty . the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations , financial condition and cash flows from period to period . a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income , and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance . our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties . our nike direct operations , including our retail stores and digital platforms , have required and will continue to require significant investment . our nike direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel . we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space . certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high - profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms . because of their unique design and technological elements , locations and size , these stores require substantially more investment than other stores . due to the high fixed - cost structure associated with our nike direct retail stores , a decline in sales , a shift in consumer behavior away from brick - and - mortar retail , or the closure , temporary or otherwise , or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs , write - offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee - related costs . many factors unique to retail operations , some of which are beyond our control , pose risks and uncertainties . risks include , but are not limited to : credit card fraud ; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners ; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation ; and theft . in addition , we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our nike direct operations , and our digital offerings will require co ntinued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms . in order to deliver high - quality digital experiences , our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies , systems , networks , and standards that we do not control . we may not be successful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies , systems , networks or standards . a growing portion of consumers access our nike direct digital platforms , but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms , consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms , the success of our nike direct operations could be adversely impacted . our competitors may develop , or have already developed , digital experiences , features , content , services or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance . we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our nike direct operations and management 's attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted , which could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations . if the technology - based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively , our operating results , as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base , could be materially adversely affected . many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms . increasingly , consumers are using mobile - based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors , and to do comparison shopping , as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms . we use social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience . any failure on our part to provide attractive , effective , reliable , secure and user - friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage , result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales , harm our reputation with consumers , have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations . in [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] addition , as use of our digital platforms continues to grow , we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers ' needs . if we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand , our business may be subject to interruptions , delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline . risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers ' brick and mortar stores , difficulty in recreating the in - store experience through direct channels and liability for online content . our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business , as well as damage our reputation and brands . we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business , including our supply chain and retail operations , and any failure , inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business . we are heavily dependent on information technology systems , across our supply chain , including product design , production , forecasting , ordering , manufacturing , transportation , sales and distribution , as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes , retail operations and other business activities . information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown . for example , our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems . over a number of years , we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate . our work to integrate , secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts . we can not provide assurance , however , that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and prevent cyber - attacks , system failures or data or information loss . the failure of these systems to operate effectively , including as a result of security breaches , viruses , hackers , malware , natural disasters , vendor business interruptions or other causes , failure to properly maintain , protect , repair or upgrade systems , or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations , could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities , and may have an adverse effect on our reputation , results of operations and financial condition . in addition , the use of employee - owned devices for communications as well as hybrid work arrangements , present additional operational risks to our information technology systems , including , but not limited to , increased risks of cyber - attacks . further , like other companies in the retail industry , we have in the past experienced , and we expect to continue to experience , cyber - attacks , including phishing , and other attempts to breach , or gain unauthorized access to , our systems . to date , these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations , but we can not provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future . we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting , legal and tax requirements . from time to time , we have expended , and expect to continue to expend , significant resources to modify , update and enhance our information technology systems and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures . these modifications , updates and enhancements may cost more than initially expected and may not be effective in preventing issues and disruptions . moreover , due to the complexity of our information technology systems , the process of implementing modifications or enhancements can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues . if information technology systems suffer severe damage , disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans , or those of our vendors , do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner , we could experience delays in reporting our financial results , which could result in lost revenues and profits , as well as reputational damage . furthermore , we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection for digital marketing , digital commerce , consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services . we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties , including customers , suppliers , vendors and consumers . any interruption in information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues , damage to our reputation , and loss of users . we are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands . we currently license , and expect to continue licensing , certain of our proprietary rights , such as trademarks or copyrighted material , to third parties . if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products , or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations , customer relationships , labor relationships , supplier relationships or credit risks , it could adversely affect our revenues , both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products . we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands . although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design , production processes , quality , packaging , merchandising , distribution , advertising and promotion of our licensed products , we can not completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees . the misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us . [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products . the athletic footwear , apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear , apparel and equipment retailers with many stores and accelerating digital commerce capabilities . the market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and investments in digital capacity , and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market . consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of retailers , any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity . in addition , increasing market share concentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products , we may be unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues . if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail , we may incur significant losses . as part of our hedging activities , we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments , which may include forward contracts , commodity futures contracts , option contracts , collars and swaps with various financial institutions . in addition , we have significant amounts of cash , cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad . as a result , we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions . the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets . if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy , our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default , or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty , may be limited by the counterparty 's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings . in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties , we could incur significant losses , which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition . we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products . as of may [XX] , [XXXX] , our contract manufacturers operated [XXX] finished goods footwear factories located in [XX] countries . we rely upon contract manufacturers , which we do not own or operate , to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell . for fiscal [XXXX] , four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than [XX] % of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately [XX] % of nike brand footwear production . our ability to meet our customers ' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our contract manufacturers . if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship , including due to changes in applicable trade policies , or be unable to perform , we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner , which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations , sales , financial condition or results of operations . additionally , if any of our primary footwear contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments , do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans , there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations . certain of our footwear contract manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product . such contract manufacturers may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce . if , in the future , the relevant products are again in demand and the specialized contract manufacturers no longer exist , we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain footwear products in a timely manner or at all , which could have a material adverse effect on our sales , financial condition or results of operations . the market for prime real estate is competitive . our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations , both domestically and internationally , depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic , square footage , co - tenancies , lease economics , demographics and other factors . we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases . in addition , from time to time , we seek to downsize , consolidate , reposition or close some of our real estate locations , which may require modification of an existing lease . failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations , or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores , could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition . additionally , the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally . this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents . any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores , which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition . [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] the success of our business depends , in part , on high - quality employees , including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values . our success depends in part on the continued service of high - quality employees , including key executive officers and personnel . the loss of the services of key individuals , or any negative perception with respect to these individuals , or our workplace culture or values , could harm our business . our success also depends on our ability to recruit , retain and engage our personnel sufficiently , both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives . competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel . changes to our current and future work models may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies ' policies , which could negatively impact our ability to attract , hire and retain our employees . in addition , shifts in u.s . immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract , hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the united states . w e also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success , and we have invested substantial time and resources in building , maintaining and evolving our culture . any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success , including our ability to retain and recruit employees . our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to united states or foreign employment regulations . we have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce , including wage and hour laws and regulations , fair labor standards , minimum wage requirements , overtime pay , unemployment tax rates , workers ' compensation rates , citizenship requirements and payroll taxes , which could have a direct impact on our operating costs . a significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases , all of which may cause us to incur additional costs . there is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment , health and safety , wage and hour laws , criminal activity , personal injury and other claims . in addition , if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements , we could be vulnerable to a strike , work stoppage or other labor action , which could have an adverse effect on our business . risks related to operating a global business our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business . nearly all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states , and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states . accordingly , we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad , which include foreign laws and regulations , varying consumer preferences across geographic regions , political tensions , unrest , disruptions or delays in cross - border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products . changes in u.s . or international social , political , regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business , reputation , financial condition and results of operations . in particular , political and economic instability , geopolitical conflicts , political unrest , civil strife , terrorist activity , acts of war , public corruption , expropriation , nationalism and other economic or political uncertainties in the united states or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations . any negative sentiment toward the united states as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business . in addition , disease outbreaks , terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad . these factors , among others , could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials , or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials , our ability to import products , our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business . if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical , our business could be adversely affected . our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing , manufacturing and financing . the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber , plastic compounds , foam cushioning materials , natural and synthetic leather , nylon , polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films — are locally available to manufacturers . the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics , yarns and threads ( both virgin and recycled ) , specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body , retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes place . both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our contract manufacturers to locate , train , employ and retain adequate personnel . nike contract manufacturers and materials suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured . there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or , in the event of a disruption or heightened competition for such materials , our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all . further , our contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future , unexpected closures , unexpected increases in work wages or other [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] changes in labor standards , whether government mandated or otherwise , and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals , fabrics or raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products . in addition , we can not be certain that manufacturers that we do not contract and that we refer to as "" unaffiliated manufacturers "" will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner . if we experience significant increases in demand , or reductions in the availability of materials , or need to replace an existing contract manufacturer or materials supplier , there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us , or at all , or that any contract manufacturer , unaffiliated manufacturer , or any materials supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements . in addition , even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing capacity or sources of materials , we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods , products , quality control standards and labor , health and safety standards . any delays , interruption or increased costs in labor or wages , in the supply of materials or in the manufacturing of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long - term . because contract manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets , our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances . delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation , container shortages , labor shortages , including work stoppages or port strikes , infrastructure and port congestion or other factors , and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers , have adversely impacted , and could in the future adversely impact the availability of our products and , in turn , our financial performance . in addition , delays in the shipment or delivery of our products , manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products have required us , and may in the future require us to use faster , but more expensive , transportation methods such as air freight , which could adversely affect our profit margins . the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs , so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins . changes in u.s . trade policies , including modifications to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements , have also had , and could continue to have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions , and could adversely affect our reputation or results of operations . our success depends on our global distribution facilities . we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world . our ability to meet customer expectations , manage inventory , complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth , particularly in emerging markets , depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities , the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties ( including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities ) . our distribution facilities have in the past and could in the future be interrupted by information technology problems , disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread . any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business . we maintain business interruption insurance , but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities . legal , regulatory , and compliance risks we are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings , which could have an adverse effect on our business , financial condition and results of operations . as a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world , we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels . if we or our employees , agents , suppliers , and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations , such failure could subject us to fines , sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation , business , financial condition and results of operations . furthermore , laws , regulations and policies and the interpretation of such , can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in one jurisdiction may result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction . we are involved in various types of claims , lawsuits , regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business , our products and the actions of our employees and representatives , including contractual and employment relationships , product liability , antitrust , trademark rights and a variety of other matters . it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations , and we could in the future incur judgments , fines or penalties , or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation . the global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks , such as anti - bribery , anti - corruption , fraud , trade , environmental , competition , privacy and other regulatory matters , will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies have and will continue to arise from time to time , which could adversely affect us . in addition , the adoption of new laws or regulations , or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations , may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks . moreover , the regulation of certain transactions we engage in , including those involving virtual goods and cryptocurrencies , remains in an early stage and subject to significant uncertainty . as a result , we are required to exercise our judgment as to whether or how certain laws or regulations apply , or may in the future [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] apply , and it is possible that legislators , regulators and courts may disagree with our conclusions . any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management 's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees . changes to u.s . or other countries ' trade policies and tariff and import / export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation , business , financial condition and results of operations . changes in the u.s . government 's import and export policies , including trade restrictions , sanctions and countersanctions , increased tariffs or quotas , embargoes , safeguards or customs restrictions , could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations . in addition , changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade , manufacturing , development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business . u.s . presidential administrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements , the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the u.s . , economic sanctions on individuals , corporations or countries , and other government regulations affecting trade between the u.s . and other countries where we conduct our business . it may be time - consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes . changes or proposed changes in u.s . or other countries ' trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade . tariffs and other changes in u.s . trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries , and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain u.s . goods . further , any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the united states or in other countries could affect the trade environment . the company , similar to many other multinational corporations , does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the united states and foreign countries ( including governmental action related to tariffs , international trade agreements , or economic sanctions ) . such changes have the potential to adversely impact the u.s . economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations , our industry and the global demand for our products , and as a result , could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and results of operations . in addition , many of our imported products are subject to duties , tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries . any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate , adjust or impose new quotas , duties , tariffs , safeguard measures , anti - dumping duties , cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism , restrictions on the transfer of currency , climate change legislation , product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions , any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition . furthermore , we are subject to the fcpa as well as the anti - corruption laws of other countries in which we operate . although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws , our employees , independent contractors , contract manufacturers , suppliers and agents , as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations , may take actions in violation of our policies . any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business , reputation and operating results . failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business . we periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights . if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights , continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products . the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others . we also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights . we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe their intellectual property rights . defending infringement claims could be expensive and time - consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements . we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development , manufacturing , use , importation and/or sale of certain products . we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights . these actions include contractual measures such as entering into non - disclosure and non - compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training . our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective . for example , confidential information related to business strategy , innovations , new technologies , mergers and acquisitions , unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely , inadvertently , or improperly used and/or disclosed , resulting in a loss of reputation , loss of intellectual property rights , a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position , and could lead to damages , fines , penalties or injunctions . in addition , new products we offer , such as virtual goods , may raise various novel intellectual property law considerations , including adequacy and scope of assignment , licensing , transfer , copyright and other right - of - use issues . [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] in addition , the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states . we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights , including outside the united states , and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others , our business or financial condition may be adversely affected . we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results , operations or reputation . in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information , we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and users of our digital experiences , which include online distribution channels and product engagement , adaptive products and personal fitness applications . hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering , such as phishing , and large - scale , complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time . any breach of our or our service providers ' networks , or other vendor systems , may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data , misappropriation of our consumers ' , users ' or employees ' personal information or a disruption of our business . any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business , including unwanted media attention , impairment of our consumer and customer relationships , damage to our reputation ; resulting in lost sales and consumers , fines , lawsuits , or significant legal and remediation expenses . we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against , respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach . in addition , we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous , and sometimes conflicting , regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states , europe and elsewhere . for example , the european union adopted the general data protection regulation ( the "" gdpr "" ) ; the united kingdom enacted the uk general data protection regulation ( which implements the gdpr into uk law ) ; several states in the united states have passed data privacy laws ; china enacted the data security law and personal information protection law ; and additional jurisdictions have adopted or are considering proposing or adopting similar regulations . these laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored . compliance with existing , proposed and recently enacted laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming , and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal , operational and reputational risks . misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations , proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others , imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits . we could be subject to changes in tax rates , adoption of new tax laws , additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate . we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and , as such , we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions . current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations , or their interpretation and application , in any jurisdiction subject to significant change . proposals to reform u.s . and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how u.s . multinational corporations are taxed on global earnings and could increase the u.s . corporate tax rate . for example , the organization for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) and the g20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting ( the "" inclusive framework "" ) has put forth two proposals — pillar one and pillar two — that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal level of taxation , respectively . on december [XX] , [XXXX] , the european union member states agreed to implement the inclusive framework 's global corporate minimum tax rate of [XX] % . other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the inclusive framework 's proposals . although we can not predict whether or in what form these proposals will be enacted into law , these changes , if enacted into law , could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate , income tax expense and cash flows . portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under a tax holiday . we also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters . tax holidays and rulings can expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met , or terminated if certain conditions are not met . the impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate . for example , in january [XXXX] , the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the netherlands has breached state aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the company . if this matter is adversely resolved , the netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods , and the company 's income taxes related to prior periods in the netherlands could increase . we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service ( "" irs "" ) and other tax authorities . we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes . although we believe our tax provisions are adequate , the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals . the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made . for example , we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions . although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place , tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates . failure of our contractors or our licensees ' contractors to comply with our code of conduct , local laws and other standards could harm our business . we have license agreements that permit independent parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property . we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property ( including , indirectly , their contract manufacturers ) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental , human rights , health and safety standards for the benefit of workers . we also require our contract manufacturers and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards for product safety . notwithstanding their contractual obligations , from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors . if one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with , or is accused of violating or failing to comply with , such standards and laws , this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and , as a result , could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition . negative publicity regarding production methods , alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers , manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales , force us to locate alternative suppliers , manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations , including new or additional quotas , tariffs , sanctions , product safety regulations or other regulatory measures , by governmental authorities . risks related to our securities , investments and liquidity our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns . from time to time , we may invest in technology , business infrastructure , new businesses or capabilities , product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses , such as our nike direct operations , which require substantial cash investments and management attention . we believe cost - effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability ; however , significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business . the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations . see also "" our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties . "" the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal shareholder could depress the market price of our common stock . as of june [XX] , [XXXX] , swoosh , llc beneficially owned approximately [XX] % of our class a common stock . if , on june [XX] , [XXXX] , all of these shares were converted into class b common stock , swoosh , llc 's commensurate ownership percentage of our class b common stock would be approximately [XX] % . the shares are available for resale , subject to the requirements of the u.s . securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing swoosh , llc . the sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock . swoosh , llc was formed by philip h. knight , our chairman emeritus , to hold the majority of his shares of class a common stock . mr . knight does not have voting rights with respect to swoosh , llc , although travis knight , his son and a nike director , has a significant role in the management of the class a common stock owned by swoosh , llc . changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity , increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options . our long - term debt is currently rated investment grade by standard & poor 's and moody 's investors service . if our credit ratings are lowered , borrowing costs for our existing facilities or for future long - term debt or short - term credit facilities may increase and our financing options , including our access to credit or capital markets , could be adversely affected . we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to , among other things , incur additional indebtedness , make restricted payments , pledge assets as security , make investments , loans , advances , guarantees and acquisitions , undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates . failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default , and as a result , the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated . in addition , macroeconomic conditions , such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit or capital markets , could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt . if our internal controls are ineffective , our operating results could be adversely affected . our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations , including the possibility of human error , the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud . even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements . if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls , including any failure to implement required new or improved controls , or if we experience [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] difficulties in their implementation , our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations . if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect , our operating results could be adversely affected . the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes . we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances , as provided in "" management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations "" . the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets , liabilities and equity , and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources . significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition , inventory reserves , hedge accounting for derivatives , income taxes and other contingencies . our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions , which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors , resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock . anti - takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock . there are provisions within our articles of incorporation and oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms . such provisions include a control share acquisition statute , a freeze - out statute , two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues , and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect three - quarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number . however , such provisions could discourage , delay or prevent an unsolicited merger , acquisition or other change in control of the company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price . these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company . we may fail to meet market expectations , which could cause the price of our stock to decline . our class b common stock is traded publicly , and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us . these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts ' opinions of our future performance , which may , in part , be based upon any guidance we have provided . analysts ' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations . if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors , our stock price could decline . in the past , securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities . if our stock price is volatile for any reason , we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future . any litigation could result in reputational damage , substantial costs and a diversion of management 's attention and resources needed to successfully run our business .
