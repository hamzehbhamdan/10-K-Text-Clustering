per - view services ; online activities , such as social networking and viewing user - generated content ; gaming products ; and other forms of entertainment , news and information . media competes for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations , digital properties , including an increasing number of ad - supported dtc streaming and other ott service providers and a broad array of other online content , such as social networking platforms and user - generated content , and all other advertising platforms . the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks , stations or digital properties . declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available . additionally , it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences . our domestic cable networks and international networks compete primarily with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage by multichannel video providers and dtc streaming and other ott service providers . our domestic broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the united states to secure affiliations with independently owned local broadcast television stations , which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience . peacock competes for subscribers primarily with other dtc streaming and other ott service providers , as well as with traditional providers of linear television programming . studios our film and television studios compete for audiences with other major film and television studios , independent film producers and creators of content , as well as with alternative forms of entertainment . the competitive position of our studios primarily depends on the number of films and television series and episodes produced , their distribution and marketing success , and consumer response . our studios also compete to obtain creative , performing and technical talent , including writers , actors , directors , and producers , as well as scripts for films and television shows , and for the distribution of , and consumer interest in , their content . we also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters , on demand , on television networks , and on dtc streaming and other ott services . theme parks theme parks competes with other multi - park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment , lodging , tourism and recreational activities . the competitive position of our theme parks primarily depends on the quality and popularity of rides and attractions , including effective use of intellectual property in themed attractions . there is increased competition in areas with high concentrations of theme parks and other attractions operated by several companies . macroeconomic conditions and other factors may also result in shifting consumer preferences toward other types of destinations and experiences . # # table_start [XX] comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k # # table_end seasonality and cyclicality revenue and costs and expenses in our media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events , such as the olympic games and the super bowl . in particular , advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the olympic games . costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the recognition of the related rights fees . revenue in media is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels . domestic advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even - numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the winter holiday season , and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue - oriented advertising , respectively . international advertising revenue typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months , with lower levels in summer months due to the timing of european football seasons , winter holidays and summer vacations . revenue also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired , which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year . revenue in studios fluctuates due to the timing , nature and number of films released in movie theaters , on physical and digital home entertainment products , and through various other distribution platforms , including viewing on demand , dtc platforms or other ott service providers . release dates are determined by several factors , including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods . as a result , revenue tends to be seasonal , with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the winter holiday season . we incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result , we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film ’s exhibition in movie theaters . content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees . revenue from our television studios fluctuates in part due to a correlation with the broadcast network season beginning annually in september . revenue in theme parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations , local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions , as well as with changes in currency exchange rates . our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period , the summer months when schools are closed and the winter holiday season . # # table_start corporate and other # # table_end our other business interests reported in corporate and other consist primarily of our sky - branded video services and television networks in germany , comcast spectacor , which owns the philadelphia flyers and the wells fargo center arena in philadelphia , pennsylvania , and xumo , our consolidated streaming platform joint venture with charter communications formed in june [XXXX] . xumo is focused on developing and offering a streaming platform on a variety of devices , including xumo tv smart televisions , which have an operating system that leverages our global technology platform , and also operates the xumo play streaming service . legislation and regulation our businesses are subject to various federal , state and local laws and regulations , with some also subject to international laws and regulations . in particular , the communications act of [XXXX] , as amended ( the “ communications act ” ) , and federal communications commission ( “ fcc ” ) regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our communications businesses in the united states . beyond the more significant regulations summarized below , legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing , and sometimes do change , existing statutes , rules or regulations , or interpretations of existing statutes , rules or regulations , or prescribe new ones , any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete . these legislators and regulators , along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities , have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services . state legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements , such as with respect to privacy and open internet / net neutrality regulations , that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete . # # table_start comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end legislative and regulatory activity has increased under the biden administration , particularly with respect to broadband networks . for example , congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives , and may consider other proposals that address communications issues , including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new , permanent open internet / net neutrality requirements . federal agencies are considering adopting new regulations for communications services , including broadband . states and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services , including broader regulation of broadband networks . any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and our legal and compliance costs . in addition , united states and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition or antitrust laws or enact new competition or antitrust laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses . any future legislative , judicial , regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses , some of which may be significant . we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses . the following paragraphs summarize the more significant legal and regulatory requirements and risks affecting our businesses . # # table_start communications - related regulations in the united states # # table_end broadband our broadband services are subject to a number of regulations and commitments . the fcc frequently considers imposing new broadband - related regulations such as those relating to an open internet , and from time to time , imposing new regulatory obligations on internet service providers ( “ isps ” ) such as us . states and localities also periodically consider new broadband - related regulations , including those regarding government - owned broadband networks , net neutrality and broadband affordability . new broadband regulations , if adopted , may have adverse effects on our businesses . we may also become subject to additional broadband - related commitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding . broadband deployment and adoption initiatives there have been , and may continue to be , substantial broadband - deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level that could subsidize ( i ) other service providers building networks within our footprint and ( ii ) potential expansion of our network to new areas . federal and state rules for certain funding programs , such as some programs in the american rescue plan act , have been finalized and are being implemented , and we have successfully participated in a number of these programs . requirements for participation in other recent programs , such as the infrastructure act ’s broadband equity access and deployment program , however , have not been finalized . we can not predict how any such funds will be awarded or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses . we participate in the affordable connectivity program ( “ acp ” ) that congress created to provide a monthly discount toward broadband service for eligible low - income households starting in [XXXX] . we can not predict whether congress will decide to continue funding the acp after the initial funding allocation is expended , likely at some point during [XXXX] , or the related impact of any such decision . open internet regulations various forms of open internet regulations can significantly affect our broadband services . the fcc currently recognizes broadband internet access services as “ information services ” under title i of the communications act subject to a “ light touch ” regulatory approach rather than to the telecommunications utilities - style regulations from the communications act of [XXXX] . however , in october [XXXX] , the fcc proposed to reclassify broadband internet access services as a “ telecommunications service , ” which would authorize the fcc to subject our broadband services to traditional common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act . while we have disclosed that we do not , and have committed not to , block , throttle , or discriminate against lawful content , which would likely be part of a title ii framework adopted by the fcc , the fcc also could , under a title ii framework , potentially regulate our customer rates , speeds , data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content , applications and service providers , including backbone interconnection arrangements . in addition , several states have adopted laws or executive orders that impose open internet requirements in a variety of ways , and new state legislation may be adopted in the future . such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create differing and/or conflicting state regulations . in addition , any fcc action could impact state open internet initiatives and prompt litigation . congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services . # # table_start [XX] comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k # # table_end we can not predict whether or how the rules might be changed , the impact of any potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation relating to such rule changes or new legislation . municipally owned broadband networks a number of local municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks , and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create government - owned networks , particularly in light of federal funding for broadband deployment . certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks , and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of government - owned networks . other states , however , have amended or may amend such laws to facilitate such networks . much of the federal funding authorized for broadband deployment is conditioned on states agreeing to make it available for potential use by government - owned networks , although the funding prioritizes deployment to unserved areas and locations . we can not predict how successful any of those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses . digital discrimination in [XXXX] , congress enacted the infrastructure investment and jobs act that , among other things , directed the fcc to adopt rules to facilitate equal access to broadband service by preventing digital discrimination of access to that service based on income level , race , ethnicity , color , religion and national origin . in [XXXX] , the fcc adopted implementing rules that , among other things , bar policies and practices not justified by genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility that : ( [X] ) differentially impact customers ’ access to broadband internet access service based on income level or other statutory categories , or ( [X] ) are intended to have such differential impact . the rules apply broadly to all aspects of broadband service that could affect a consumer ’s ability to receive and effectively utilize broadband services , including performance characteristics like speeds and capacity , as well as service plan characteristics like data caps and non - technical terms and conditions of service , such as pricing and promotions . the fcc will enforce the rules on a case - by - case basis based on complaints filed by consumers , state and local governments , and other entities . we can not predict how these rules will be interpreted and enforced and how they might affect our business , or the outcome of any potential litigation to challenge the rules . video the video marketplace continues to be competitive , particularly with dtc streaming and other ott service providers . there are a number of laws and regulations that apply solely to multichannel video programming distributors ( “ mvpds ” ) or cable operators such as us in terms of the video services we provide through our residential connectivity & platforms business and to cable networks and local broadcast television stations . these laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete , particularly against dtc streaming and other ott service providers , which are not subject to these same requirements . cable pricing and packaging while our video services are not subject to rate regulation , certain state entities monitor and challenge in court the marketing and advertising of our services . the fcc and the federal trade commission ( “ ftc ” ) are also considering proposals that , if adopted , would regulate how we market , price and bill for our services . we can not predict the outcome of these rulemakings or any current litigation with state entities . cable franchising cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities . while the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction , franchises typically last for a fixed term , obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality , customer service and other requirements , and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions . franchising authorities also may require adequate channel capacity , facilities and financial support for public , educational and governmental access programming , and other in - kind contributions . the communications act also contains provisions governing the franchising process , including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal and unreasonable renewal conditions . we believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but can not guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise . the fcc currently prohibits state and local authorities from imposing duplicative franchise and/or fee requirements on the provision of broadband and other non - cable services , and franchise fees are subject to a federal statutory cap of [X] % of cable service revenue only and may not include revenue from broadband or other non - cable services offered over a cable system . the current regulations also require that in - kind contributions ( such as courtesy services ) generally should be treated as franchise fees subject to that cap . several localities have attempted , generally unsuccessfully to date , to impose franchise fees on dtc streaming and other ott service providers . # # table_start comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end program carriage fcc regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its non - affiliation in the selection , terms or conditions for its carriage . in addition , cable operators and other mvpds in the united states are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in , or exclusive distribution rights for , a video programming network . we have been involved in program carriage disputes at the fcc , as well as in the courts , and may be subject to new complaints in the future . program access the communications act and fcc regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing mvpds . the fcc and congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with mvpds and potentially with dtc streaming and other ott service providers . we currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis ( in “ tiers ” ) and , in various cases , individually . we have been involved in program access disputes at the fcc and may be subject to new complaints in the future . must - carry / retransmission consent cable operators are required to carry , without compensation , programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations . as an alternative to this “ must - carry ” requirement , local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “ retransmission consent , ” under which the station gives up its must - carry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator , which frequently will involve payments to the station . we currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations ’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations . failure to reach a retransmission consent agreement with a broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video services . every three years , each local commercial broadcast television station must elect for each cable system either must - carry or retransmission consent . a similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers . for the three - year period from january [X] , [XXXX] to december [XX] , [XXXX] , all of our owned nbc and telemundo local broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent . although we have reached retransmission consent agreements with almost all mvpds in the past , there can be no assurance that we will always be able to renew those agreements under favorable terms or at all . broadcast licensing local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest , convenience and necessity . the fcc grants broadcast television station licenses for [X] - year cycles , which may be renewed with or without conditions . the fcc renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions during the last license renewal cycle ; the current television license renewal cycle began in [XXXX] and some of our licenses have been renewed . although our licenses have been renewed in prior cycles , there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants . broadcast ownership restrictions the communications act and fcc regulations impose certain limitations on local and national television ownership , as well as limits on foreign ownership in a broadcast television station . some of these limitations currently are under review at the fcc , including the national television ownership limit . children ’s programming under federal regulations , the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks , broadcast networks and local broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children [XX] years of age and under is limited , and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children [XX] years of age and under . fcc spectrum proceedings the fcc , the department of commerce ’s national telecommunications and information administration and other federal agencies are in the process of evaluating and potentially modifying allocations and rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used for licensed and unlicensed commercial services , including [X] g services , which could impact potential interest in future spectrum bands for auction or alternative assignment . in addition , because our businesses use some of this spectrum to provide services , they have been transitioning their operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for [X] g , and they may be required to transition other operations in the future if the fcc reallocates other spectrum bands that we use , which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs . # # table_start [XX] comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k # # table_end wireless we offer a wireless voice and data service primarily using our mvno rights to provide the service over verizon ’s wireless network . mvnos are subject to many of the same fcc regulations as facilities - based wireless carriers , such as e911 services and local number portability , as well as certain state or local regulations . the fcc or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for mvnos and/or mobile broadband providers in the future , which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally . voice we provide voice services using voip technology . the fcc has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours , including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information , local number portability duties and benefits , disability access , e911 , law enforcement assistance , outage reporting , universal service fund contribution obligations , rural call completion , customer equipment back - up power , robocall mitigation , service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements . the fcc has not yet ruled on whether voip services such as ours should be classified as an “ information service ” or a “ telecommunications service ” under the communications act . state regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of voip remains unsettled at the federal level . # # table_start international communications - related and other regulations # # table_end certain of our international businesses are subject to telecommunications and media - specific regulation described below in europe , latin america and other international jurisdictions , and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws , such as competition , consumer protection , data protection and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate . our international businesses are currently , and may be in the future , subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate . in addition , the u.k . government is proposing to introduce extensive new consumer and competition legislation in [XXXX] , the digital markets competition and consumer bill . we can not predict how the proposed regulation will affect sky ’s businesses . platform services in the united kingdom , sky ’s electronic program guide ( “ epg ” ) and conditional access ( “ ca ” ) services are provided to other programming providers on fair , reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms , among other things , so that those providers ’ content is available on the sky satellite platform via the epg on set - top boxes . sky also has voluntarily committed to the united kingdom ’s communications regulator , the office of communications ( “ ofcom ” ) to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services . sky is subject to similar epg and ca obligations in germany . television networks and on - demand services our video business holds a number of licenses and authorizations for their portfolios of television networks and on - demand services . for example , in the united kingdom , sky - branded television networks are licensed and subject to various codes issued by ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these networks . we also hold various broadcast licenses in certain e.u . and other countries . these content - related rules and regulations cover issues such as the acquisition and exploitation of sports rights , media concentration and plurality , television advertising , the protection of children , accessibility , airtime for commercials and teleshopping , sponsorship and ensuring clear distinctions between program content and advertising . broadband and voice our connectivity & platforms business provides broadband and voice services in the united kingdom , the republic of ireland and italy pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that third - party broadband and telecommunications companies either make available commercially or are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions . material changes to these regulations could affect our business . as a provider of broadband services , we are subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to telecommunications security , including a u.k . law that requires providers to take certain measures with respect to potential security compromises . we are also subject to e.u . and other open internet / net neutrality regulations , which prohibit the blocking , throttling or discrimination of online content , applications and services and require isps to disclose their traffic management , throughput limitations and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts . # # table_start comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start other areas of regulation # # table_end intellectual property copyright , trademark , unfair competition , patent , trade secret and other proprietary - rights laws of the united states and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights . in particular , unauthorized copying , distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet , through devices , software and websites , counterfeit dvds / blu - rays and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses . we have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content . although many legal protections exist to combat such practices , the extent of copyright protection is sometimes ambiguous and the use of technological protections can be controversial . modifications to existing laws , a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of existing laws , in the united states or internationally , to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming . u.s . copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals . we also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute . the cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems . in addition , the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing , and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations . we can not predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay . privacy and data protection regulation our businesses are subject to laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the processing of individuals ’ personal information . in the united states , federal privacy laws and regulations , such as those found within the communications act or the video privacy protection act , focus on restricting companies ’ collection , use , disclosure and retention of personal information . the proliferation of laws at the state level has expanded consumers ’ rights to include individual rights of access , deletion , portability , correction , the right to appeal , and the individual ’s right to “ opt in ” to collection and use of certain types of “ sensitive ” personal information . internationally , many of the laws are similar to the european union ’s general data protection regulation and the united kingdom ’s data protection act [XXXX] , which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the european union and united kingdom , respectively . some of our businesses are also subject to the ftc ’s general oversight of consumer privacy protections through its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices , as well as through its enforcement authority over the children ’s online privacy protection act . the ftc has sought to expand its authority in this area through various rulemakings related to general privacy , targeted advertising and children ’s privacy . there has been an increased focus on children ’s privacy at both the state and federal levels within the united states , as well as internationally , such as the united kingdom ’s age - appropriate design code . these new laws may require changes to our products and services and could adversely affect our advertising businesses . in addition , many international data protection laws , some federal laws and all [XX] u.s . states have security breach notification requirements that mandate a business to provide notice to consumers and government agencies if certain information has been accessed or exfiltrated by an unauthorized party ; some of these laws also require documented information security programs . state and local taxes some u.s . states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing , through both legislative and administrative channels , new or additional taxes or fees on , or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by , our businesses , or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes , fees , incentives or credits are computed , earned or monetized . these include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes , central assessments for property tax , and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our businesses , most notably new taxes or fees on digital advertising or other digital commerce . in some situations , dbs providers and other competitors ( such as dtc streaming and other ott service providers ) that deliver their services over a broadband connection do not face the same state and local tax and fee burdens . congress has also considered , and may consider again , proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these dbs providers or other competitors ( such as dtc streaming and other ott service providers ) that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay . the internet tax freedom act ( “ itfa ” ) prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges and discriminating against electronic commerce ; however , some jurisdictions may challenge the itfa or the application of the itfa to our business , or may assert that certain taxes akin to right - of - way fees are not preempted by the itfa . # # table_start [XX] comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k # # table_end other regulations u.s . states and localities , and various regulatory authorities , actively regulate other aspects of our businesses , including our studios and theme parks businesses , accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities , customer service standards , inside wiring , cable equipment , pole attachments , universal service fees , regulatory fees , public safety , telemarketing , leased access , indecency , loudness of commercial advertisements , advertising , political broadcasting , sponsorship identification , emergency alert system , equal employment opportunity and other employment - related laws , environmental - related matters , our equipment supply chain , and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations . in addition , our international businesses are subject to various similar regulations , including those that cover television broadcasting , programming and advertising . we are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the fcc and other federal , state and local agencies , as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities , which can result in fines or being subject to sanctions . human capital resources as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had approximately [XXX,XXX] full -

driven , rapidly changing environments . we compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment , sports , news and information content to consumers . there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses . below is a summary of our most significant sources of competition . many of these competitors offer competitive pricing , packaging and/or bundling of services to customers , which further increases competition . in addition , our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience . for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses , see item [X] : business and refer to the “ competition ” discussion within that section . • connectivity & platforms ’ broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies , including many that are increasing deployment of fiber - based networks ; wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services ( using a variety of technologies , including [X] g fixed wireless networks and [X] g and [X] g wireless broadband services ) ; electric cooperatives and municipalities in the united states that own and operate their own broadband networks ; and dbs and newer satellite broadband providers . broadband - deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint , and in cases where we receive subsidies , may impose constraints on how we conduct our businesses . for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses , see “ — we are subject to regulation by federal , state , local and foreign authorities , which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses ” below and item [X] : business and refer to the “ legislation and regulation ” discussion within that section . • competition for video services consists primarily of dtc streaming and other ott service providers and aggregators , dbs providers and telecommunications companies , and our wireless and voice services compete with both telecommunications and wireless telecommunication providers . • business services connectivity primarily competes with wireline telecommunications companies and wide area network managed service providers . • our businesses in content & experiences , as well as our video business , face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment , sports , news and information content , as well as from other forms of entertainment , including from social networking and user - generated content , and recreational activities . they must compete to obtain talent , popular content ( including sports programming ) , advertising and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses . this competition has further intensified as certain dtc streaming and other ott service providers have commissioned , and may continue to commission , high - cost programming and acquire live sports programming rights to attract viewers at significant costs . competitors with significant resources , greater efficiencies of scale , fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging continue to increasingly compete with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production . further , consolidation of , or cooperation between , our competitors may increase competition in all of these areas . for example , cooperation between competitors may allow them to offer free or lower cost dtc streaming and other ott services , potentially on an exclusive basis , through unlimited data - usage plans for internet or wireless phone services or to bundle dtc streaming and other ott services on their platform . our businesses ’ ability to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies , including our customers , consumers , advertisers , business partners , employees , investors and government authorities . for example , some of these constituencies may have their own , and some have conflicting , environmental , social and governance priorities , which may present risks to our reputation and brands if these constituencies perceive misalignment . changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models . distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content have been , and will likely continue to be , developed that further challenge existing business models and increase the number of competitors that our businesses face . dtc streaming and other ott services have driven , and will continue to drive , changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when , where and how they consume content and access communications services , and how much they pay for such content . # # table_start comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end as consumers increasingly turn to dtc streaming and other ott services in lieu of our linear video services , which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses , the number of video customers we have , the related video revenues and the amount of subscriber fees we receive for our linear television networks from other video service providers each decrease . the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers , rather than through , or in addition to , traditional video distribution channels , continues to disrupt traditional media distribution business models despite our efforts to adapt our video service offerings and offer new services , such as peacock and now . the number of entertainment choices available to consumers , such as dtc streaming and other ott service providers and aggregators , social networking and user - generated content platforms , and gaming and virtual reality products and services , continue to significantly increase , intensify audience fragmentation and disaggregate the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers . this in turn has reduced traditional television viewership , and when coupled with time - shifting technologies , such as dvr and on demand services , has caused , and likely will continue to cause , audience ratings declines for our television networks . in addition , as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms , they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or peacock . on the other hand , this practice may also negatively impact our results of operations when we keep our content for our own use , including for peacock , rather than licensing it to third parties who pay us licensing fees for such content . our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior , including among younger consumers , and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position , businesses and results of operations . a decline in advertisers ’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses . we compete for the sale of advertising time with television networks and stations , digital properties , including an increasing number of ad - supported dtc streaming service providers and a broad array of other online content providers , such as social networking platforms and user - generated content providers , and all other advertising platforms . we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising , and we expect that a decline in expenditures by advertisers , including through traditional linear television distribution models or on peacock , could negatively impact our results of operations . we have experienced , and may continue to experience , declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries , increased competition for the leisure time of viewers , such as from social networking and user - generated content platforms and video games , audience fragmentation , increased viewing of content through dtc streaming and other ott service providers , increased use of time - shifting and advertising - blocking technologies or regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed , and economic conditions generally . in addition , advertisers have shifted , and may continue to shift , a portion of their total expenditures to digital media , including dtc streaming service providers and other online content providers , and this trend may continue or accelerate . lower audience ratings and reduced viewership , which many of our linear television networks have experienced , and likely will continue to experience , as well as the level of popularity of peacock , affect advertisers ’ willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid . advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels . our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content , and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance . we create and acquire media and entertainment content , the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways , and to meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets , we must consistently create , acquire , market and distribute television programming , filmed entertainment , theme park attractions and other content . we have invested , and will continue to invest , substantial amounts in content , such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services , and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions , before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance . in addition , there can be no assurance that peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base , successfully compete as a standalone dtc streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks ’ results of operations as the media distribution business model continues to change . we obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties , such as movie studios , television production companies , sports organizations and other suppliers , sometimes on an exclusive basis . competition for popular content , particularly for sports programming , is intense , and at times , we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content . we also may be unable to license popular third - party content if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests . for example , content creators have launched , and may continue to launch , their own dtc streaming or other ott services , forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers , or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis . # # table_start [XX] comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k # # table_end entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted , and may result in the future , in significantly increased costs . particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights , our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors , including the strength of the advertising market , audience size , the timing and amount of rights payments , and the ability to secure distribution from , impose surcharges on , or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own dtc services . there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights , as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming . if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance , or if we can not obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms , or at all , our businesses may be adversely affected . programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis , which could adversely affect our video businesses . we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our residential connectivity & platforms business and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis . part of these programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers ; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations . these market factors may be exacerbated by consolidation in the media industry , which may further increase our programming expenses . if we are unable to offset programming cost increases through rate increases , the sale of additional services , cost management or other initiatives , the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our results of operations . moreover , as our contracts with programming providers expire , there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms , or at all , in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services , and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected . the loss of programming distribution agreements , or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms , could adversely affect our businesses . our linear television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers . the number of subscribers to our television networks has been , and likely will continue to be , reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers as the media distribution business model changes . similarly , multichannel video providers may elect not to enter into agreements to distribute some or all of our linear television networks as a result of these changing market dynamics . in addition , our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third - party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station . our owned local broadcast television stations must elect , with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers , either “ must - carry ” status , in which we require the provider to carry the station without paying any compensation to us , or “ retransmission consent , ” in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage , including the amount of compensation , if any , paid to us by such provider . for all of these types of arrangements , our ability to renew agreements on favorable terms may be affected by evolving market dynamics and industry consolidation . there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on similar terms . the inability to enter into or renew some or all of these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming , which could adversely affect our businesses . our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others . we rely on our intellectual property , such as patents , copyrights , trademarks and trade secrets , as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties , to use various technologies , conduct our business operations and sell our products and services . legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms , incur substantial monetary liability , or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question , from importing into the united states or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted . we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur , which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations . even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit , they can be time - consuming , costly to defend and may divert management ’s attention and resources away from our businesses . moreover , if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms , our businesses could be adversely affected . # # table_start comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end in addition , intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of our businesses , and our success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content we create or acquire against third - party misappropriation , reproduction or infringement . the unauthorized reproduction , distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content , as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content , and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights . the legal landscape for new technologies , including artificial intelligence ( “ ai ” ) , remains uncertain , and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against unauthorized third - party use , misappropriation , reproduction or infringement . piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier , and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging , by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming , films and other content into digital formats , which facilitates the creation , transmission and sharing of high - quality unauthorized copies . in particular , piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for our businesses . for example , certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation , and sporting events on our international networks may be illegally transmitted . while piracy is a challenge in the united states , it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws , effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states . if any u.s . or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced , or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy , we may be unable to effectively protect our rights , the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase . we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware , software and operational support . we depend on third - party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware , software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services . we also rely on third - party satellite transponder capacity to provide video services in europe , as well as on third - party wireless networks to offer certain wireless services in the united states and internationally . some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products . while we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties , there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties . if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties , including as a result of cybersecurity incidents , or any other supply chain compliance - related issues , if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment , products or services we need in a timely manner ( or at all ) , or at reasonable prices , our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs . our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments . our success is , to a large extent , dependent on our ability to acquire , develop , adopt and leverage new and existing technologies , and our competitors ’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage . new technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways , including affecting the demand for our products , the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers , how we create our entertainment products , the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers . for example , current and new wireless internet technologies ( including [X] g fixed wireless networks and [X] g and [X] g wireless broadband services ) continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies and create more competitors for our businesses . in addition , some companies and u.s . municipalities are building advanced fiber - based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds , and some providers offer newer satellite broadband services . we expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future . if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors , if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers or that enhance our business operations , such as through the use of ai , or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives , our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected . we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives , such as the deployment of multigigabit symmetrical speeds by leveraging our docsis [X.X] technology and the development and enhancement of various streaming platforms . there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future . we also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors ’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures . # # table_start [XX] comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k # # table_end a cyber attack , information or security breach , or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information , all of which could adversely affect our business , reputation and results of operations . network and information systems and other technologies , including those that are related to our network management , customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services , are critical to our business activities . in the ordinary course of our business , there are constant attempts by third parties to cause systems - related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design . these incidents include computer hackings , cyber attacks , computer viruses , worms or other destructive or disruptive software , denial of service attacks , phishing attacks , malicious social engineering and other malicious activities . incidents can be caused inadvertently by us or our third - party vendors , such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design . cyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency , which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them . for example , we expect threat actors will continue to gain sophistication by using tools and techniques ( such as ai ) that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls . some cyber attacks have had , and in the future can have , cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks , information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and third - party vendors ’ systems and other technologies . we also obtain certain confidential , proprietary and personal information about our customers , personnel and vendors , that in many cases is provided or made available to third - party vendors who agree to protect it , which has in the past and may in the future become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach , misappropriation , misuse , leakage , falsification or accidental release or loss of information by us or a third party . due to the nature of our businesses , we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form . we also incorporate third - party software ( including extensive open - source software ) , applications , and data hosting and cloud - based services into many aspects of our products , services and operations , as well as rely on service providers to help us perform our business operations , all of which expose us to cyber attacks with respect to such third - party suppliers and service providers and their products and services . while we develop and maintain systems , and operate programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring , these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections . the occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents has caused , and may from time to time in the future cause , a variety of business impacts . these include degradation or disruption of our network , products and services , excessive call volume to call centers , theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets , disruption of the security of our internal systems , products , services or satellite transmission signals , power outages , and the compromise or exfiltration of confidential or technical business information and customer or vendor data , and reputational impacts . moreover , the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result . in addition , any such events have and could continue to lead to litigation or cause regulators in the united states and internationally to impose significant fines or other remedial measures , including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules , or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company . despite our efforts , we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future , and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business , reputation or results of operations . refer to item 1c : cybersecurity for additional information . weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses . a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions . weak economic conditions in the united states , in europe or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services , including advertising , and have a negative impact on our results of operations . for example , weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers ’ discretionary spending and as a result , they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether . this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services , such as certain dtc streaming and other ott services , or substitute services for broadband and voice services , such as wireless and public wi - fi networks . weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue , the performance of our films and home entertainment releases , and attendance and spending in our theme parks . in particular , the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out - of - home entertainment experiences , which may be limited by weakened economic conditions . # # table_start comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end weak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets , such as higher interest rates , may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms , if at all , which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate . further , inflationary pressures in the united states , in europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties ( including advertisers , customers , suppliers , wholesale distributors , retailers and content creators , among others ) to satisfy their obligations to us . acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks , and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated . from time to time , we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives , such as xumo , our consolidated streaming platform joint venture . in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives , we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses , fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies , have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business , disrupt relationships with current and new employees , customers and vendors , incur significant debt , divert the attention of management from our current operations , or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives . these and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long - lived assets . additionally , federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the fcc or doj or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions . the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations . we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses . we operate our businesses worldwide . there are risks inherent in doing business internationally , including global financial market turmoil ; economic volatility and global economic slowdown ; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures ; geopolitical risks , including acts of terror and war ; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising ; import or export restrictions , tariffs , sanctions and trade regulations ; difficulties in developing , staffing and managing foreign operations ; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations ; and potentially adverse tax developments . additionally , although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks , including the british pound , euro and japanese yen , the use of such derivative instruments may n ot be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations . in addition , doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest , as well as corruption and government regulations , including u.s . laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k . bribery act , that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations . moreover , foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do busines s can be inconsistent and unpredictable , which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense . if any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations , our businesses may be adversely affected . natural disasters , severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business , reputation and results of operations . our services , products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events , including natural disasters , severe weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires , and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks , including covid-19 , terrorist attacks or other similar events . such events have in the past caused , and could in the future cause , a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network , products and services , excessive call volume to call centers , a reduction in demand for our products , services and theme parks , disruption of our internal systems , products , services or satellite transmission signals , power outages , and damage to our or our customers ’ or vendors ’ equipment and properties . these events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties , products and services and could lead to litigation and fines , including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others . for example , covid-19 and corresponding governmental measures negatively impacted our businesses in the past , including as recently as in [XXXX] by requiring temporary closures of our theme parks . the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result . we expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future , and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business , reputation or results of operations . # # table_start [XX] comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] -

term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel , the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses . in addition , content & experiences depend on the abilities and expertise of on - air and creative talent . if we fail to attract or retain on - air or creative talent , if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially , or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal , our businesses could be adversely affected . labor disputes , whether involving employees or sports organizations , may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses . many of the writers , directors , actors , technical and production personnel , as well as some on - air and creative talent employees in our content & experiences business , are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils . many of these collective bargaining agreements are industry - wide agreements , and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements . if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement , our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us , which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue , and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs . for example , the writers guild of america ( “ writers guild ” ) and the screen actors guild - american federation of television and radio artists ( “ sag ” ) work stoppages from may to september [XXXX] and july to november [XXXX] , respectively , paused productions , which reduced content licensing revenue at our studios segment . there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages in the future . in addition , labor disputes in sports organizations with which we have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration could have an adverse effect on our businesses . risks related to legal , regulatory and governance matters we are subject to regulation by federal , state , local and foreign authorities , which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses . our businesses are subject to various federal , state and local laws and regulations , with some also subject to international laws and regulations . in particular , the communications act and fcc regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our cable communications and broadcast businesses in the united states . legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing , and sometimes do change , existing statutes , rules or regulations , or interpretations of existing statutes , rules or regulations , or prescribe new ones , any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete . these legislators and regulators , along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities , have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services . state legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements , such as with respect to privacy and open internet / net neutrality regulations , that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete . legislative and regulatory activity has increased under the biden administration , particularly with respect to broadband networks . for example , congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives , and may consider other proposals that address communications issues , including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new , permanent open internet / net neutrality requirements . # # table_start comcast [XXXX] annual report on form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end federal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services , including broadband . for example , the fcc has proposed reimposing network neutrality requirements that would reclassify our broadband service as a “ telecommunications service ” under title ii of the communications act , which would authorize the fcc to potentially regulate our customer rates , speeds , data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services and prohibit , or seriously restrict , arrangements between us and internet content , applications and service providers . states and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services , including broader regulation of broadband networks . any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and our legal and compliance costs . in addition , u.s . and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition or antitrust laws or enact new competition or antitrust laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses . any future legislative , judicial , regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses , some of which may be significant . we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses . failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions , fines , and civil and criminal liability . any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations . for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses , see item [X] : business and refer to the “ legislation and regulation ” discussion within that section . unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures . we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries , including claims relating to competition , intellectual property rights ( including patents ) , employment and labor matters , personal injury and property damage , free speech , customer privacy , regulatory requirements , advertising , marketing and selling practices , and credit and collection issues . greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business . we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards , including any related investigations and litigation . we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses , results of operations or financial condition . our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions , and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock . our class b common stock has a non -

resorts as well as disney cruise line and disney vacation club compete with other forms of entertainment , lodging , tourism and recreational activities . the profitability of the leisure - time

of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise . all of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year - round basis . typically , theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities , the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers . peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods . in addition , theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations . the licensing , retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by

federal communications commission ( fcc ) under federal laws and regulations , including the communications act of [XXXX] , as amended . violation of fcc regulations can result in substantial monetary fines , limited renewals of licenses and , in egregious cases , denial of license renewal or revocation of a license . fcc regulations that affect linear channels include the following : • licensing of television stations . each of the television stations we own must be licensed by the fcc . these licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years , and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations . we ( and the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture ) must also obtain fcc approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station . the fcc may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances and may delay renewals while permitting a licensee to continue operating . although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past or have been permitted to continue operations when renewal is delayed , there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future . • station ownership limits . the fcc imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations an entity can own in a specific market , on the combined number of television and radio stations an entity can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations . currently : ◦ fcc regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market , depending on the size and nature of the market . we do not own more than one television station in any market . ◦ federal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of [XX] % of the national audience . pursuant to the most recent decision by the fcc as to how to calculate compliance with this limit , our eight stations reach approximately [XX] % of the national audience . • dual networks . fcc rules currently prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — abc , cbs , fox and nbc — from being under common ownership or control . table of contents • regulation of programming . the fcc regulates broadcast programming by , among other things , banning “ indecent ” programming , regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during children ’s programming . penalties for broadcasting indecent programming can be over $ [XXX,XXX] per indecent utterance or image per station . federal legislation and fcc rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children [XX] years of age and younger . in addition , broadcast stations are generally required to provide an average of three hours per week of programming that has as a “ significant purpose ” meeting the educational and informational needs of children [XX] years of age and younger . fcc rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance . • cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations . with respect to mvpds operating within a television station ’s designated market area , fcc rules require that every three years each television station elect either “ must carry ” status , pursuant to which mvpds generally must carry a local television station in the station ’s market , or “ retransmission consent ” status , pursuant to which the mvpds must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal . the abc owned television stations have historically elected retransmission consent . • cable and satellite carriage of programming . the communications act and fcc rules regulate some aspects of negotiations between programmers and distributors regarding the carriage of networks by cable and satellite distribution companies , and some cable and satellite distribution companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on their systems . new legislation , court action or regulation in this area could have an impact on the company ’s operations . the foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act , other legislation and specific fcc rules and policies . reference should be made to the communications act , other legislation , fcc rules and public notices and rulings of the fcc for further information concerning the nature and extent of the fcc ’s regulatory authority . fcc laws and regulations are subject to change , and the company generally can not predict whether new legislation , court action or regulations , or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations , would have an adverse impact on our operations . available information our annual report on form [XX] - k ,

factors could materially affect future developments and performance . in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the sec , the most significant factors affecting our business include the following : business , economic , market and operating condition risks declines in u.s . , global , and regional economic conditions generally adversely affect the profitability of our businesses . declines in economic conditions , such as recession , economic downturn , and/or inflationary conditions in the u.s . and other regions of the world in which we do business , or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated typically adversely affect demand and/or expenses for one or more of our businesses , reducing our revenue and earnings . past declines in economic conditions reduced guest spending at our parks and resorts , purchases of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations , performance of our home entertainment releases , and purchases of company - branded consumer products , and similar impacts can be expected as such conditions recur . recent inflationary conditions increased certain of our costs . the current economic conditions could also have the effect of reducing attendance at our parks and resorts , prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming , purchases of and prices for advertising on our dtc products or subscription levels for our cable programming or dtc products , while also continuing to increase the prices we pay for goods , services and labor . unfavorable economic conditions also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us . in addition , an increase in price levels generally , or in price levels in a particular sector , could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and experiences we offer , which could also adversely affect our revenues and , at the same time , increase our costs . a decline in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated could impact table of contents implementation or success of our business plans , such as our plans to increase investment in our experiences segment , the realignment of our cost structure and plans for our dtc ad - supported services , enhancements , pricing structure and price increases . in addition , actions to reduce inflation , including raising interest rates , increase our cost of borrowing , which in turn make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms . further , global economic conditions impact foreign currency exchange rates against the u.s . dollar . the current or continued strength in the value of the u.s . dollar has adversely impacted the u.s . dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services . although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations , any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact , particularly in periods of sustained u.s . dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies . further , economic or political conditions in countries outside the u.s . also have reduced , and could continue to reduce , our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries . broader or targeted supply chain delays , such as those that have impacted global distribution from time to time , may further exacerbate inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations . the adverse impact on our businesses of declines in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated will depend , in part , on the severity and duration of such economic conditions and our ability to mitigate the impacts of economic conditions on our businesses may be limited . changes in technology , in consumer consumption patterns and in how entertainment products are created affect demand for our entertainment products , the revenue we can generate from these products and the cost of producing or distributing these products . the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to new technologies including shifting patterns of content consumption and how entertainment products are generated . new technologies affect the demand for our products , the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers , ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams , the sources and nature of competing content offerings , the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences . these developments have impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution , as evidenced by the industry - wide decline in ratings for broadcast and cable television , the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content , the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels . these trends have decreased advertising and affiliate revenue at some of our linear networks . in addition , theater - going to watch movies currently is , and may continue to be , below pre - covid-19 levels . rules governing new technological developments , such as developments in generative artificial intelligence ( ai ) , remain unsettled , and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model , including revenue streams for the use of our ip and how we create our entertainment products . in order to respond to the impact of new technologies on our businesses , we regularly consider , and from time to time implement changes to our business models , most recently by developing , investing in and acquiring dtc products , reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to advance our dtc strategies , and developing new media offerings . there can be no assurance that our dtc offerings , new media offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to technological changes . in addition , declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our dtc offerings , negatively impacting the profitability of our dtc offerings . we expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources , particularly as we expand our dtc offerings . to date our dtc streaming services have experienced significant losses . there can be no assurance that the dtc model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models . we face risks relating to misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment , travel and consumer products , which impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and the profitability of any of our businesses . our businesses create entertainment , travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways . the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content , which may be distributed , among other ways , through broadcast , cable , theaters , internet or mobile technology , and used in theme park attractions , hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products . such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content . the success of our theme parks , resorts , cruise ships and experiences , as well as our theatrical releases , depends on demand for public or out - of - home entertainment experiences . demand for certain out - of - home entertainment experiences , such as theater - going to watch movies , has not returned to pre - pandemic levels . in addition , many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s . the success of our businesses therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s . moreover , we must often invest substantial amounts in content production and acquisition , acquisition of sports rights , launch of new sports - related studio programming , theme park attractions , cruise ships or hotels and other facilities or customer facing platforms before we table of contents know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance , and these products may be introduced into a significantly different market or economic or social climate from the one we anticipated at the time of the investment decisions . generally , our revenues and profitability are adversely impacted when our entertainment offerings and products , as well as our methods to make our offerings and products available to consumers , do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance . further , consumers ’ perceptions of our position on matters of public interest , including our efforts to achieve certain of our environmental and social goals , often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands . consumer tastes and preferences impact , among other items , revenue from advertising sales ( which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air ) , affiliate fees , subscription fees , theatrical film receipts , the license of rights to other distributors , theme park admissions , hotel room charges and merchandise , food and beverage sales , sales of licensed consumer products or sales of our other consumer products and services . the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create . the value to us of our ip is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s . and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed . if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights , or if existing laws are changed , our ability to generate revenue from our ip may decrease , or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase . the terms of some copyrights for ip related to some of our products and services have expired and other copyrights will expire in the future . for example , in the united states and countries that look to the united states copyright term when shorter than their own , the copyright term for early works such as the short film steamboat willie ( [XXXX] ) , and the specific early versions of characters depicted in those works , expires at the end of the 95th calendar year after the date the copyright was originally secured in the united states . as copyrights expire , we expect that revenues generated from such ip will be negatively impacted to some extent . the unauthorized use of our ip may increase the cost of protecting rights in our ip or reduce our revenues . the convergence of computing , communication and entertainment devices , increased broadband internet speed and penetration , increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films , television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of ip rights more challenging . the unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for ip rights holders . inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry ip in one country can adversely affect the results of the company ’s operations worldwide , despite the company ’s efforts to protect its ip rights . distribution innovations , including in response to covid-19 , have increased opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways . additionally , negative economic conditions coupled with a shift in government priorities could lead to less enforcement . these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our ip against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content and other commercial misuses of our ip . the legal landscape for some new technologies , including some generative ai , remains uncertain , and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against infringing uses . with respect to ip developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others , the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright , trademark and patent rights by third parties . in addition , the availability of copyright protection and other legal protections for ip generated by certain new technologies , such as generative ai , is uncertain . successful challenges to our rights in ip may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from or utilize the ip that is the subject of challenged rights . from time to time , the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain ip rights of third parties . technological changes in industries in which the company operates and extensive patent coverage in those areas may increase the risk of such claims being brought and prevailing . protection of electronically stored data and other cybersecurity is costly , and if our data or systems are materially compromised in spite of this protection , we may incur additional costs , lost opportunities , damage to our reputation , disruption of service or theft of our assets . we maintain information necessary to conduct our business , including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees , in digital form . we also use computer systems to deliver our products and services and operate our businesses . data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access , modification , exfiltration , destruction or denial of access and our computer systems are subject to cyberattacks that may result in disruptions in service . we use many third - party systems and software , which are also subject to supply chain and other cyberattacks . we develop and maintain an information security program to identify and mitigate cyber risks but the development and maintenance of this program is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated . accordingly , despite our efforts , the risk of unauthorized access , modification , exfiltration , destruction or denial of access with respect to data or systems and other cybersecurity attacks can not be eliminated entirely , and the risks associated with a potentially material incident remain . in table of contents addition , we provide confidential , proprietary and personal information to third parties in certain cases , which information is also subject to risk of compromise . if our information or cyber security systems or data are compromised in a material way , our ability to conduct our business may be impaired , we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and , as described above , we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property . if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated , our reputation with our customers and employees may be damaged resulting in loss of business or morale , and related remediation of harm to our customers and employees or damages arising from litigation and/or fines or other actions we take with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of an incident create additional costs . insurance we obtain does not cover all potential losses or damages associated with such attacks or events . our systems and users and those of third parties with whom we engage are continually attacked , sometimes successfully , and there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results . a variety of uncontrollable events may disrupt our businesses , reduce demand for or consumption of our products and services , impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost or reduce the profitability of providing our products and services . the operation and profitability of our businesses and demand for and consumption of our products and services , particularly our parks and experiences businesses , are highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism , including in the specific regions in which our parks and experiences businesses operate . in addition , we have extensive international operations , including our international theme parks and resorts , which are dependent on domestic and international regulations consistent with trade and investment in those regions . the operation of our businesses and the environment for travel and tourism , as well as demand for and consumption of our other entertainment products , can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s . , globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control , including : health concerns ( including as it has been by covid-19 and could be by future health outbreaks and pandemics ) ; adverse weather conditions arising from short - term weather patterns or long - term climate change , including longer and more regular excessive heat conditions , catastrophic events or natural disasters ( such as excessive heat or rain , hurricanes , typhoons , floods , droughts , tsunamis and earthquakes ) ; international , political or military developments , including trade and other international disputes and social unrest ; macroeconomic conditions , including a decline in economic activity , inflation and foreign exchange rates ; and terrorist attacks . these events and others , such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks , intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures , may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to some of these events . an incident that affected our property directly would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities . moreover , the costs of protecting against such incidents reduces the profitability of our operations . for example , covid-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our businesses in a number of ways , most significantly at the experiences segment where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended . in addition , we delayed , or in some cases , shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content . collectively , our impacted businesses historically have been the source of the majority of our revenue . in addition , hurricanes have impacted the profitability of walt disney world resort and may do so in the future . the company has paused certain operations in certain regions , including in response to sanctions , trade restrictions and related developments and the profitability of certain operations has been impacted as a result of events in the corresponding regions . in addition , we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming , sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties , and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company , and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue . the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely impacted by the significant contraction of distribution channels for our products and services , including through third - party licensees or sellers of our licensed goods and services . in addition , third - party suppliers provide products and services essential to the operation of a number of our businesses . a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties or materially impacted a supplier of a significant product or service , the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected . in specific geographic markets , we have experienced delayed and/or partial payments from certain third parties due to liquidity issues . we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events , generally including certain physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption , certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities . when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles , exclusions , terms , conditions and limits of liability . the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we may experience material losses not covered by our insurance . table of contents we face risks related to changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses , which have affected and may continue to affect our cost structure , the profitability of our businesses or the value of our assets . as changes in our business environment occur we have adjusted , continue to adjust and may further adjust our business strategies to meet these changes and we may otherwise decide to further restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets . for example , in fiscal [XXXX] , we reorganized our media and entertainment operations , which had been previously reported in one segment , into two segments , entertainment and sports ; in fiscal [XXXX] we announced that we would review content , primarily on our dtc services , for alignment with a strategic change in our approach to content curation , resulting in removal of certain content from our platforms and related impairment charges ; in fiscal [XXXX] , we announced plans to introduce an ad - supported disney+ service , new pricing model and price increases and cost realignment ; in fiscal [XXXX] , we announced the closure of a substantial number of our disney - branded retail stores ; and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses . changes in strategy , such as was the case with the most recent reorganization of our media and entertainment operations , can lead to workforce disruptions . our new organization and strategies are , among other things , subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits , such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value . for example , notwithstanding our announced plans to rationalize costs , the costs of our dtc strategy , and associated losses , may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated , which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses / distribution platforms , the types of content we distribute through various businesses / distribution platforms , and the timing and sequencing of content windows . our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies . in addition , external events including changing technology , changing consumer purchasing patterns , acceptance of content offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets . when these changes or events occur , we have incurred and may continue to incur costs to change our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write - down the value of assets . in addition to the content impairment noted above , among other assets , we have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our linear networks and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets . we may write down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the current business environment . we also make investments in existing or new businesses , including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines . for example , in fiscal [XXXX] , we announced that we are developing plans to accelerate and expand investment in our experiences segment . in addition , in recent years , other investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks , expansion of our fleet of cruise ships , the acquisition of tfcf corporation ( tfcf ) and investments related to dtc offerings . some of these and future investments may ultimately result in returns that are negative or low , the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments are uncertain , and these investments may impact the resources available to , and the profitability of , our other businesses . in addition , our costs may increase , we may have significant charges associated with the write - down of assets , as occurred in connection with the closure of star wars : galactic starcruiser or returns on new investments may be negative or lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring . even if our strategies are effective in the long term , our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term , growth of our new offerings is unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not expand into new markets as or when anticipated . our ability to forecast for new businesses may be impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses , speed with which the competitive landscape changes , volatility beyond our control ( such as the events beyond our control noted above ) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based . accordingly , we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes . increased competitive pressures impact our revenues and increase our costs . we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment , lodging , tourism and recreational activities . this includes , among other types , competition for human resources , content and other resources we require in operating our business . for example : • our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative , performing , production and business talent , sports and other programming , story properties , advertiser support , production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms , including other studio operators , television networks , vod providers and other sources of broadband delivered content . • our television networks and stations and dtc offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms , including other television and vod services , as well as with newspapers , magazines , billboards and radio stations , and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content , which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means . • our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers . • our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment , lodging , tourism and recreation activities and compete for creative , performing and business talent , including with other theme park and resort operators . • our content sales / licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment . table of contents • our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of ip . • our dtc streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors ’ dtc offerings , all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment , as well as for technology , creative , performing and business talent and for content . competition in each of these areas may further increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure , including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels . increased competition has increased , and may continue to increase , the cost of programming , including sports and other products and diverts consumers from , or delays their consumption of , our creative or other products , or to other products or other forms of entertainment and experiences , which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs . competition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services ; change the composition of our offerings , including sports ; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses , including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material ; increase employee turnover and staffing instability ; or increase the cost of compensation for our employees . such competition may also reduce , or limit growth in , prices for our products and services , including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks and dtc offerings , parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues . our results may be adversely affected if long - term programming or distribution contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms . we enter into long - term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products , including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs , and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors . as these contracts expire , we must renew or renegotiate the contracts , which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed , and if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms , we may lose programming rights or distribution rights . as a result , our portfolio of programming rights we acquire and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and may continue to change over time . even if these contracts are renewed , the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase ( or increase at faster rates than our historical experience ) and programming distributors , facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges , have demanded and may continue to demand terms ( including with respect to the pricing for , and the nature and amount of , programming distributed ) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs ( or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience ) . for example , a recent carriage agreement renewal includes fewer of our linear networks but provides for certain of our dtc streaming services to be made available to the distributor ’s subscribers . moreover , our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by a number of factors , such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms . with respect to the acquisition of programming rights , particularly sports programming rights , the impact of these long - term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors , including the strength of advertising markets , subscription levels and programming rights costs increases , effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences . there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming . regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses . each of our businesses , including our broadcast networks and television stations , is subject to a variety of u.s . and international regulations , which impact the operations and profitability of our businesses . some of these regulations include : • u.s . fcc regulation of our television and radio networks , our national programming networks and our owned television stations . see item [X] — federal regulation - entertainment and sports . • federal , state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations . • regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations , including regulation regarding the sourcing , importation and the sale of goods . • environmental protection regulations . • u.s . and international anti - corruption laws , sanction programs , trade restrictions and anti - money laundering laws . • restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed , ownership restrictions or film or television content requirements , investment obligations or quotas . • domestic and international labor laws , tax laws or currency controls . new laws and regulations , as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities in any of these areas , or others , may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations , or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable , and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape . in addition , ongoing and future developments in international political , trade and security policy may lead to new regulations table of contents limiting international trade and investment and disrupting our operations outside the u.s . , including our international theme parks and resorts operations in france , mainland china and hong kong . for example , in [XXXX] the u.s . and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against russia in response to events in russia and ukraine ; u.s . agencies have enhanced trade restrictions , including new prohibitions on the importation of goods from certain regions and other jurisdictions are considering similar measures ; u.s . state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies and applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies , including streaming and online commerce ; and in many countries / regions around the world ( including but not limited to the eu ) regulators are requiring us to broadcast on our linear ( or display on our dtc streaming services ) programming produced in specific countries as well as invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content productions . in florida , steps directed at the company ( including the passage of legislation ) have been taken and future actions have been threatened , which collectively could negatively impact ( and may have already impacted ) our ability to execute on our business strategy , our costs and the profitability of our operations in florida . further , in response to the covid-19 pandemic , public health and other regional , national , state and local regulations and policies impacted most of our businesses . government requirements could be reinstated and new government requirements may be imposed to address covid-19 or future health outbreaks or pandemics . our operations outside the u.s . may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions . our operations in non - u.s . jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than , or in addition to , u.s . law . laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s . these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business , and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s . law . moreover , enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable , which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business . in addition , the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption , which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or u.s . anti - corruption laws applicable to our businesses . as a result , our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non - u.s . jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s . law alone governed these operations . environmental , social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses . u.s . and international regulators , investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental , social and governance matters . for example , new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to environmental , social and governance matters , including environmental sustainability and climate change , human capital management and cybersecurity , are under consideration or being adopted , which may include specific , target - driven disclosure requirements or obligations . our response will require increased costs to comply , the implementation of new reporting processes , entailing additional compliance risk , a skilled workforce and other incremental investments . in addition , we have undertaken or announced a number of related actions and goals , which will require changes to operations and ongoing investment . there is no assurance that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes or that we will achieve any of these goals . consumer , government and other stakeholder perceptions of our efforts to achieve these objectives often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands . in addition , our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors . for example , our ability to meet certain environmental sustainability goals or initiatives will depend in part on third - party collaboration , the availability of suppliers that can satisfy new requirements , mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale . damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our company across businesses and regions . our reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses . because our brands engage consumers across our businesses , damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses . because some of our brands are globally recognized , brand damage may not be locally contained . maintenance of the reputation of our company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings , maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate . in addition , we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands , and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands . significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations , products , management , employees , practices , business partners , business decisions , social responsibility and culture , which may be amplified by social media , adversely impact our brands or reputation , even if such claims are untrue . damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales , business opportunities , profitability , recruiting and valuation of our securities . various risks may impact the success of our dtc streaming services . we may not successfully execute on our dtc strategy . the success of our dtc strategy and profitability of our dtc streaming services will be impacted by the success of the reorganization of our media and entertainment business and our ability to advance our dtc strategies , drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content , table of contents manage churn in reaction to price increases , achieve the desired financial impact of the disney+ ad supported service , pricing model and price increases , our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows . the initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the business of initial exploitation , and amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights are generally allocated across businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows . accordingly , our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business , including the applicable dtc service . there are a number of competing dtc businesses . consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of dtc streaming services at increasing prices , potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn . in addition , economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our dtc streaming services . we face competition for creative talent and sports and other programming rights and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent and obtaining desired programming rights or face increased costs to do so . acquisition of new subscribers to our dtc streaming services is not linear , and we have experienced net losses of subscribers in some periods . our content does not always successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect . our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect . we may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals . government regulation , including revised foreign content and ownership regulations as well as government - imposed content restrictions , impacts the implementation of our dtc business plans . the highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our dtc offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or lead to higher churn rates . these and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our dtc streaming services . potential credit ratings actions , increases in interest rates , or volatility in the u.s . and global financial markets could impede access to , or increase the cost of , financing our operations and investments . our borrowing costs have been and can be affected by short- and long - term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based , in part , on the company ’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios . as a result of the financial impact of covid-19 on our businesses , standard and poor ’s downgraded our long - term debt ratings by two notches to bbb+ and downgraded our short - term debt ratings by one notch to a-2 . fitch downgraded our long- and short - term credit ratings by one notch to a- and f2 , respectively . on june [X] , [XXXX] , standard and poor ’s upgraded our long - term debt ratings by one notch to a- . as of september [XX] , [XXXX] moody ’s investors service ’s long- and short - term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1 ( stable ) , respectively , standard and poor ’s long- and short - term debt ratings for the company were a- and a-2 ( positive ) , respectively , and fitch ’s long- and short - term debt ratings for the company were a- and f2 ( stable ) , respectively . any future downgrades could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on acceptable terms . in addition , increases in interest rates have increased our cost of borrowing and volatility in u.s . and global financial markets could impact our access to , or further increase the cost of , financing . past disruptions in the u.s . and global credit and equity markets made it more difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms . these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur , our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments . elevated indebtedness or leverage ratios could adversely affect us , including by decreasing our business flexibility . elevated indebtedness could have the effect of , among other things , reducing our financial flexibility and our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and other uncontrollable events . debt repayment obligations could also reduce funds available for investments , capital expenditures , share repurchases and dividends , and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels . our leverage ratios increased as the result of covid-19 ’s impact on financial performance , which caused certain of the credit ratings agencies to downgrade their assessment of our credit ratings . downgrades to our debt rating may negatively impact our cost of borrowings and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on acceptable terms . labor disputes disrupt our operations and may adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses . a significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses , including employees of our theme parks , and writers , directors , actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements . in addition , some of our employees outside the u.s . are represented by works councils , trade unions or other employee associations . further , the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our licensed consumer products , and employees of providers of programming content ( such as sports leagues ) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers . from time to time , collective bargaining agreements and other labor agreements expire , requiring renegotiation of their terms . in general , labor disputes and work stoppages involving our employees ; persons employed on our productions ; athletes or others employed by , or otherwise connected with , sports leagues or organizers ; or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our licensed consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues . for example , on may [X] , [XXXX] , members of the writers guild of america ( wga ) commenced a work stoppage , which lasted for almost five months . on july [XX] , [XXXX] , members of sag - aftra , the union representing television and movie actors , also commenced a work stoppage , which lasted for almost four months . these work stoppages have impacted our table of contents productions and the pipeline for programming and theatrical releases , which could result in reduced revenue and have an adverse effect on our profitability . the new collective bargaining agreements with the directors guild of america , wga and sag - aftra will lead to increased costs to create content , including as a result of increases in rates , residuals and benefits . generally , resolution of disputes or negotiation of new agreements , including rate increases and other changes to employee benefits , has in the past increased our costs and may increase our costs in the future . the seasonality of certain of our businesses and timing of certain of our product offerings could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations . each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations and variations in connection with the timing of our product offerings , including as follows : • revenues at the experiences segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities and seasonal consumer purchasing behavior , which generally results in increased revenues during the company ’s first and fourth fiscal quarters . peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods . revenues at the experiences segment also may fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from special celebrations or events that may increase demand in the applicable periods and decrease demand in prior or later periods as guests time their vacations to occur during such special celebrations or events . in addition , licensing revenues fluctuate with the timing and performance of our theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts . • revenues from television networks and stations are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels , including related to certain sporting events . in general , domestic general entertainment linear networks advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months , and sports advertising revenues are impacted by the timing of sports seasons and events , which varies throughout the year or may take place periodically . • revenues from content sales / licensing fluctuate due to the timing of content releases across various distribution markets . release dates and methods are determined by a number of factors , including , among others , competition , and the timing of vacation and holiday periods . • dtc revenues fluctuate based on : changes in the number of subscribers , mix of subscribers to different offerings and subscriber fees ; viewership levels ; and the demand for sports and film and television content . each of these may depend on the availability of content , which varies from time to time throughout the year based on , among other things , sports seasons , content production schedules and sports league work stoppages . accordingly , negative impacts on our business occurring during a time of typical high seasonal demand such as our park closures due to covid-19 restrictions or hurricane damage during the summer travel season or other high seasons , could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year . our operations are impacted by our ability to attract and retain employees and costs of employee wages and health , welfare and pension benefits , including postretirement medical benefits for some employees and retirees , may reduce our profitability . with approximately [XXX,XXX] employees , the success of our businesses is substantially affected by our ability to attract and retain a workforce with the necessary skills for our varied businesses , including executing successfully on succession planning for the talent at all levels necessary to advance the company ’s key objectives and strategies . further , our profitability is substantially affected by labor costs , including wages and our health , welfare and pension benefits , including the costs of medical benefits for current employees and the costs of postretirement medical benefits for some current employees and retirees . we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic , regulatory , competitive and other factors . for example , labor costs in our parks and resorts have increased , and we expect will continue to increase , as a result of collective bargaining agreements and wage laws and regulations where we operate . future health outbreaks and pandemics may lead to an increase in the cost of medical insurance and expenses . in addition , changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension and postretirement medical expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years . these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements . there can be no assurance that we will succeed in attracting and retaining the human resources necessary for the success of our businesses or in limiting cost increases from wages and other employee benefits , which could reduce the profitability of our businesses . we face risks related to costs and expenses in connection with the acquisition of nbcu ’s equity interest in hulu and the tfcf acquisition . on november [X] , [XXXX] , nbcu exercised its right to require the company to purchase nbcu ’s equity interest in hulu under a put / call arrangement between the parties . the purchase price for nbcu ’s

mile ” network . both our national backbone and regional / metro network components utilize a redundant ip ring / mesh fiber architecture . the national backbone component provides connectivity from regional demarcation points to nationally centralized content , connectivity and services . the regional / metro network components provide connectivity between the regional demarcation points and headends within a specific geographic area and enable the delivery of content and services between these network components . our last - mile network utilizes a hybrid fiber coaxial cable ( “ hfc ” ) architecture , which combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable . in most systems , we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes , and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes served by that node . our design standard allows spare fiber strands to each node to be utilized for additional residential traffic capacity , and enterprise customer needs as they arise . for our spectrum enterprise customers , fiber optic cable is extended to the customer ’s site . for most new buildouts , including for our rural construction initiative , and mdu sites , we utilize a fiber deployment . we believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality with a cost efficient path to increased speeds . hfc architecture benefits include : • bandwidth capacity to enable traditional and two - way video and broadband services ; • dedicated bandwidth for delivering two - way services , signal quality and higher service reliability , which provides an advantage over fixed wireless offerings ; • the ability to upgrade capacity at a lower incremental capital cost relative to our competitors ; and • a powered network enabling out - of - home advanced wifi and [X] g small cell access points . our systems currently provide a two - way all - digital platform , leveraging docsis [X.X] technology and bandwidth of [XXX] megahertz or greater , to virtually all of our estimated passings . this bandwidth - rich network enables us to offer a large selection of hd channels and spectrum internet gig across all of our footprint which enables us to provide fast , reliable and secure online connections , meeting current customer demands . through our network evolution initiative , we are currently expanding our spectrum to [X.X] ghz through a module upgrade in the hub , node and amplifier and using high splits and daa to deliver multi - gig speed capabilities while using the current docsis [X.X] customer premise equipment . when paired with the next generation of docsis modem , docsis [X.X] , we will be able to deliver even faster speeds . next , we will begin to deploy docsis [X.X] technology in the network , and further increase our spectrum to [X.X] ghz enabling even higher speed capabilities . this network evolution will also allow us to extend fiber services to the home in a success based “ fiber on demand ” manner . we plan to complement our wireline investments with planned wifi upgrades for in - home routers . with nearly [XXX] million devices connected wirelessly to our network in our customers ' homes and businesses , we are unlocking our network investments for multi - gigabit speeds through the deployment of wifi 6e which began in [XXXX] , and a planned shift to wifi [X] in late [XXXX] . we own [XXX] citizen broadband radio service ( "" cbrs "" ) priority access licenses ( "" pals "" ) . we intend to use these licenses along with unlicensed cbrs spectrum to build our own [X] g data - only mobile network on targeted [X] g small cell sites leveraging our hfc network to provide power and data connectivity to the majority of the sites . these [X] g small cells , combined with growing wifi capabilities , increase speed and reliability along with improving our cost structure through offload of wireless data onto our owned networks . in [XXXX] , we commercialized our first market with our [X] g network and will continue deploying [X] g small cell sites in targeted areas of our footprint , as part of our broader multi - year [X] g mobile network buildout , based on disciplined cost reduction targets . subsidized rural construction initiative in [XXXX] , we continued our subsidized rural construction initiative in which we intend to expand our network to offer a suite of broadband connectivity services , including fixed internet , wifi and mobile to over [X.X] million passings in unserved areas in states where we currently operate . since inception in the beginning of [XXXX] , we have spent $ [X.X] billion on our subsidized rural construction initiative and activated approximately [XXX,XXX] passings . including amounts spent to date , we expect to invest over $ [X] billion in total over the next several years , a portion of which we expect to offset with government funding , including over $ [X] billion of support awarded through december [XX] , [XXXX] in the rdof auction and other federal , state and municipal grants . we also expect to participate in additional federal , state and municipal grant programs over the coming years , including the bead program , if regulatory conditions are conducive to private investment . in addition to construction in areas subsidized by various government grants , we expect to continue rural construction in areas near our current plant and in areas surrounding subsidized construction where synergies can be achieved . these investments will allow us to generate long - term infrastructure - style returns by further taking advantage of our scale efficiencies , network quality and construction capabilities , while offering our high quality products and services to more homes and businesses . we expect these newly - served homes will be enabled to engage in remote work , virtual learning , telemedicine and other bandwidth - heavy applications that require high speed broadband connectivity . newly - served rural areas will also benefit from our high - value spp structure including our voice and mobile offerings , as well as our comprehensive selection of video products . the successful and timely execution of such fiber - based construction is dependent on a variety of external factors , including the make - ready and utility pole permitting processes . with fewer homes and businesses in these areas , broadband providers need to access multiple poles per home , as opposed to multiple homes per pole in higher - density settings . as a result , pole applications , pole replacement rules and their affiliated issue resolution processes are all factors that can have a significant impact on construction timing and speed to completion . the rdof auction rules and other subsidy grants establish construction milestones for the build - out utilizing subsidized funding . failure to meet those milestones could subject us to financial penalties . management , customer operations and marketing our operations are centralized , with senior executives responsible for coordinating and overseeing operations , including establishing company - wide strategies , policies and procedures . sales and marketing , field operations , customer operations , network operations , engineering , advertising sales , human resources , legal , government relations , information technology and finance are all directed at the corporate level . regional and local field operations are responsible for customer premise service transactions and maintaining and constructing that portion of our network which is located outdoors . our field operations strategy includes completing a significant portion of our activity with our employees which we find drives consistent and higher quality services . in [XXXX] , our in - house field operations workforce handled approximately [XX] % of our customer premise service transactions . in addition , we have been growing our in - house construction teams to perform a portion of our network expansion initiatives . we continue to focus on improving the customer experience through enhanced product offerings , reliability of services , and delivery of quality customer service . as part of our operating strategy , we insource most of our customer operations workload . our in - house call centers handle all of our customer service calls . we manage our customer service call centers centrally to ensure a consistent , high quality customer experience . in addition , we route calls by call type to specific agents that only handle such call types , enabling agents to become experts in addressing specific customer needs , creating a better customer experience . service from our call centers continues to become more efficient as a result of new tool enhancements that give our front - line customer service agents more context and real - time information about the customer and their services which allows them to more effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues . our call center agent desktop interface tool enables virtualization of all call centers thereby better serving our customers . virtualization allows calls to be routed across our call centers regardless of the location origin of the call , reducing call wait times , and saving costs . we also provide customers with the opportunity to interact with us in the manner they choose through self - service options on our customer website and mobile device application , or via telephonic communication , online chat and social media . our customer websites and mobile applications enable customers to pay their bills , manage their accounts , order and activate new services and utilize self - service help and support . in addition , our self - install program has been beneficial for customers who need flexibility in the timing of their installation . we sell our residential and commercial services using national brand platforms known as spectrum , spectrum business , spectrum enterprise , spectrum reach and spectrum community solutions . these brands reflect our comprehensive approach to industry - leading products , driven by speed , performance and innovation . our marketing strategy emphasizes the sale of our bundled services through targeted direct response marketing programs to existing and potential customers , and increases awareness and the value of the spectrum brand . our marketing organization creates and executes marketing programs intended to grow customer relationships , increase the number of services we sell per relationship , retain existing customers and cross - sell additional products to current customers . we monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts , customer perception , competition , pricing , and service preferences , among other factors , in order to increase our responsiveness to our customers and to improve our sales and customer retention . the marketing organization manages all residential and smb sales channels including inbound , direct sales , online , outbound telemarketing and stores . programming we believe that offering a wide variety of video programming choices influences a customer ’s decision to subscribe to and retain our video and internet services . we obtain basic and premium programming , usually pursuant to written contracts from a number of suppliers . we are also beginning to obtain access to the related dtc services pursuant to those contracts . media corporation and broadcast station group consolidation has , however , resulted in fewer suppliers and additional selling power on the part of programming suppliers . programming is usually made available to us for a license fee , which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom we make that programming available . programming license fees may include various discounts such as “ volume ” discounts and other financial incentives and/or ongoing marketing support , as well as discounts for service penetration . we receive revenue to carry home shopping channels . we also offer vod and pay - per - view channels of movies and events that are subject to a revenue split with the content provider . competition residential services we face intense competition for residential customers , both from existing competitors and , as a result of the rapid development of new technologies , services and products , from new entrants . internet competition our residential internet service faces competition across our footprint from fiber - to - the - home ( "" ftth "" ) , fixed wireless broadband , internet delivered via satellite and dsl services . at&t inc . ( "" at&t "" ) , frontier communications corporation ( “ frontier ” ) and verizon are our primary ftth competitors . given the ftth deployments of our competitors , launches of broadband services offering [X] gbps or more of speed have recently grown . several competitors , including at&t , frontier , verizon , wideopenwest , inc . ( "" wow "" ) and google fiber , deliver [X] gbps broadband speed ( and some deliver multi gbps ) in at least a portion of their footprints which overlap our footprint . additionally , several national mobile network operators offer long - term evolution ( “ lte ” ) or [X] g delivered fixed wireless home internet service in our markets . in several markets , we also face competition from one or more fixed wireless providers that deliver point - to - point internet connectivity . dsl service is offered across our footprint often at prices lower than our internet services , although typically at speeds much lower than the minimum speeds we offer as part of spp . in addition , commercial areas , such as retail malls , restaurants and airports , offer wifi internet service . numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi internet access networks . in addition , providers are constructing open access networks that can deliver services from multiple underlying internet service providers . these options offer alternatives to cable - based internet access . we face terrestrial broadband internet ( defined as at least [XX] mbps ) competition from three primary competitors , at&t , frontier and verizon , in approximately [XX] % , [XX] % and [X] % of our operating footprint , respectively . video competition our residential video service faces growing competition across our footprint from a number of other sources , including companies that deliver linear network programming , movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband internet connections to televisions , computers , tablets and mobile devices . these competitors include virtual mvpds such as hulu live , youtube tv , sling tv , philo and directv stream . other online video business models and products have also developed , some offered by programmers , including , ( i ) subscription video on demand ( “ svod ” ) services such as netflix , apple tv+ , amazon prime and hulu plus , ( ii ) programmer dtc applications such as disney+ , peacock and paramount+ , ( iii ) ad - supported free online video products , including youtube and pluto tv , some of which offer programming for free to consumers that we currently purchase for a fee , ( iv ) pay - per - view products , such as itunes , and ( v ) additional offerings from mobile providers which continue to integrate and bundle video services and mobile products . historically , we have generally viewed svod online video services as complementary to our own video offering and , in the case of programmer dtc offerings , have begun to package the dtc services with the linear offerings . however , services from virtual mvpds and dtc offerings , as well as piracy and password sharing , negatively impact the number of customers purchasing our video product . our residential video service also faces competition from dbs service providers , which have a national footprint and compete in all of our operating areas . dbs providers offer satellite - delivered pre - packaged programming services that can be received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes . dbs providers offer aggressive promotional pricing and video services that are comparable in many respects to our residential video service . our residential video service also faces competition from large telecommunications companies , primarily verizon , which offer wireline video services in significant portions of our operating areas . voice competition our residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers across our footprint , as well as other forms of communication , such as text messaging on cellular phones , instant messaging , social networking services , video conferencing and email . we also compete with “ over - the - top ” phone providers , such as vonage , skype , magicjack , google voice and ooma , inc . , as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service . the increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying voice services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our residential voice service . mobile competition our mobile service faces competition from national mobile network operators including at&t , verizon and t - mobile us , inc . ( "" t - mobile "" ) , as well as a variety of regional operators and mobile virtual network operators . most carriers offer unlimited data packages to customers while some also offer free or highly discounted devices . various operators also offer wireless internet services delivered over networks which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speeds . at&t , verizon and t - mobile continue to expand [X] g mobile services . additionally , dish network corporation completed its [X] g network development and expansion and now offers [X] g broadband service to over [XX] % of the u.s . population . we also compete for retail activations with other resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers for resale . regional competitors in some of our operating areas , other competitors have built networks that offer internet , video and voice services that compete with our services . for example , in certain service areas , our residential internet , video and voice services compete with wow , altafiber , google fiber and astound broadband . additional competition in addition to multi - channel video providers , cable systems compete with other sources of news , information and entertainment , including over - the - air television broadcast reception , live events , movie theaters and the internet . competition is also posed by fixed wireless and satellite master antenna television ( "" smatv "" ) systems serving mdus , such as condominiums , apartment complexes , and private residential communities . business services we face intense competition across each of our business services product offerings . our smb internet , video and voice services face competition from a variety of providers as described above . our enterprise solutions also face competition from the competitors described above as well as cloud - based application - service providers , managed service providers and other telecommunications carriers , such as metro and regional fiber - based carriers . advertising we face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors . advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new advertising platforms seek to attract the same advertisers . we compete for advertising revenue against , among others , local broadcast stations , national cable and broadcast networks , radio stations , print media , connected device platforms and online advertising companies and content providers . seasonality and cyclicality our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations . our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation service areas . our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels . our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year , due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season . u.s . advertising revenue is also cyclical , benefiting in even - numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue - oriented advertising . our capital expenditures and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth , network programs , specific projects and construction . regulation and legislation the following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry and our services for both residential and commercial customers . cable systems and related communications networks and services are extensively regulated by the federal government ( primarily the fcc ) , certain state governments and many local governments . a failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial penalties . our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework , whether triggered by legislative , administrative , or judicial rulings . congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation and they are likely to do so again in the future . we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new laws , regulations or regulatory actions that do not equally impact our key competitors . for example , internet - delivered streaming video services compete with our traditional video service , but they are not subject to the same level of federal , state , and local regulation . we can not provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future . video service must carry / retransmission consent there are two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television stations on cable systems . federal “ must carry ” regulations require cable systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the local broadcaster . alternatively , federal law includes “ retransmission consent ” regulations , by which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for “ retransmission consent , ” which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions . popular stations routinely invoke “ retransmission consent ” and demand substantial compensation increases in their negotiations with cable operators , thereby significantly increasing our operating costs . pole attachments the communications act of [XXXX] , as amended ( the “ communications act ” ) , requires investor - owned utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits upon non - discriminatory terms and at rates that are subject to either federal or state regulation . the federally regulated rates applicable to pole attachments used for cable or telecommunications services , including when offered together with internet service , are substantially similar . the fcc 's approach does not directly affect the rate in states that self - regulate , but many of those states have substantially the same rate for all communications attachments . we sometimes face challenges getting access to poles in rural areas where upfront construction and make ready costs can be higher and where pole owners may be slow to grant our permit requests , especially when the fcc pole attachment rules do not apply . other fcc regulatory matters the communications act and fcc regulations cover a variety of additional areas applicable to our video services , including , among other things : ( [X] ) licensing of systems and facilities , including the grant of various spectrum licenses ; ( [X] ) equal employment opportunity obligations ; ( [X] ) customer service standards ; ( [X] ) technical standards ; ( [X] ) mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming ; ( [X] ) restrictions on political advertising ; ( [X] ) restrictions on advertising in children ’s programming ; ( 8) ownership restrictions ; ( [X] ) posting of certain information on an fcc “ public file ” website , including but not limited to political advertising records , equal employment opportunity practices , compliance with children ’s programming requirements , policies for commercial leased access , system information , and channel carriage information including disclosure of our ownership interests in channels we carry ; ( [XX] ) emergency alert systems ; ( [XX] ) inside wiring and contracts for mdu complexes ; ( [XX] ) accessibility of content , including requirements governing video - description and closed - captioning ; ( [XX] ) competitive availability of cable equipment ; ( [XX] ) the provision of up to [XX] % of video channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties ; and ( [XX] ) public , education and government entity access requirements . each of these regulations restricts our business practices to varying degrees and may impose additional costs on our operations . the fcc regulates spectrum usage in ways that could impact our operations including for microwave backhaul , broadcast , unlicensed wifi and cbrs . our ability to access and use spectrum that may become available in the future is uncertain and may be limited by further fcc auction or allocation decisions . new spectrum obtained by other parties could also lead to additional wireless competition to our existing and future services . it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems or the services delivered over cable systems and competing services in the future . for example , in december [XXXX] , the fcc sought comment on a proposed rule that would prohibit cable television providers from charging fees for early termination of a contract and would require them to provide a prorated credit or rebate for the remaining days in a billing cycle after the cancellation of video service . we can not predict at this time what new requirements may be adopted and how such changes might impact our business . copyright the carriage of television and radio broadcast signals by cable systems are subject to a federal compulsory copyright license . the copyright law provides copyright owners the right to audit our payments under the compulsory license , and the copyright office is currently considering modifications to the license ’s royalty calculations and reporting obligations . the possible modification or elimination of this license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming . franchise matters our cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises , permits , and similar authorizations granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public rights - of - way . cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply . the specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary significantly between jurisdictions . they generally contain provisions governing cable operations , franchise fees , system construction , maintenance , technical performance , customer service standards , supporting and carrying public , education and government access channels , and changes in the ownership of the franchisee . although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms , certain federal protections benefit cable operators . for example , federal law imposes a cap on franchise fees of [X] % of gross revenues from the provision of cable services over the cable system . in [XXXX] , the fcc clarified that the value of in - kind contribution requirements set forth in cable franchises is subject to the statutory cap on franchise fees , and it reaffirmed that state and local authorities are barred from imposing franchise fees on revenues derived from non - cable services , such as internet services , provided by cable operators over cable systems . those rules were generally upheld by a federal court in [XXXX] . a number of states have adopted franchising laws that provide for state - issued franchising . generally , state - issued cable franchises are for a fixed term ( or in perpetuity ) , streamline many of the traditional local cable franchise requirements and eliminate local negotiation and enforcement of terms . the communications act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably deny renewals . if we fail to obtain renewals of franchises representing a significant number of our customers , it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition , results of operations , or our liquidity . similarly , if a franchising authority ’s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system , the franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent . internet service the fcc originally classified broadband internet access services , such as those we offer , as an “ information service , ” which exempted the service from traditional communications common carrier laws and regulations . in [XXXX] , the fcc reclassified broadband internet access services as “ telecommunications service ” and , on that basis , imposed a number of “ net neutrality ” rules governing the provision of broadband service . in [XXXX] , the fcc reversed its [XXXX] decision and eliminated the [XXXX] rules , other than a transparency requirement , which obligates us to disclose performance statistics and other service information to consumers . in [XXXX] , the fcc opened a new net neutrality proceeding in which it proposed rules that would again reclassify our internet access services as telecommunications services and thereby subject the services to additional regulation including rules that would prohibit internet service providers from engaging in paid prioritization , throttling , or content blocking . we can not predict the outcome of that proceeding or legal challenges to any new rules . it is also possible that congress might enact legislation affecting the rules applicable to our internet access services . the application of new legal requirements to our internet services could adversely affect our business . in [XXXX] , the fcc adopted new rules to expand the surviving transparency requirement by requiring internet service providers to post standardized labels disclosing their network management policies and performance of our broadband internet access services similar to the format of food nutrition labels for each of our currently available consumer internet offerings . these new rules are scheduled to become applicable to our services in april [XXXX] . the [XXXX] fcc decision reclassifying internet access services also ruled that state regulators may not impose obligations similar to federal network neutrality obligations that the fcc eliminated , but this blanket prohibition was vacated by the u.s . court of appeals in [XXXX] . the court left open the possibility that individual state laws could be deemed preempted on a case by case basis if it is shown that they conflict with federal law . several states have adopted rules similar to the network neutrality requirements that were eliminated by the fcc , and the california rules were upheld in federal court . california has also adopted other regulations on internet services , including network resiliency rules to assure backup power is available after natural disasters and other outages , and it has an open proceeding to consider the imposition of service quality metrics on internet service providers . new york adopted legislation that would have required internet service providers to offer a discounted internet service to qualifying low - income consumers , but a federal district judge enjoined enforcement as likely to be deemed rate regulation of internet service that would be preempted by federal law . that decision is currently being appealed . we can not predict what other legislation and regulations may be adopted by states or how challenges to such requirements will be resolved . in march [XXXX] , the ftc proposed rules that would limit the ability of companies that offer subscription services to make retention offers to consumers who are considering canceling their service . the rules would also apply to our video and voice services . we can not predict the outcome of that proceeding or legal challenges to any new rules . the application of the proposed rules could adversely affect our business . in november [XXXX] , the fcc adopted new rules governing digital discrimination , pursuant to the infrastructure investment and jobs act of [XXXX] ( the “ iija ” ) , to prevent discrimination of access to broadband internet services . these rules are scheduled to go into effect in [XXXX] , but have been challenged in federal court and the outcome of such challenge can not be predicted . the application of the proposed rules could adversely affect our business . in recent years , the federal , state and local governments have offered billions of dollars in subsidies to companies deploying broadband to areas deemed to be “ unserved ” or “ underserved , ” using funds from the fcc ’s rdof auction in [XXXX] , the american rescue plan act of [XXXX] ( “ arpa ” ) , and iija . we support such subsidies , provided they are not directed to areas that are already served , and have sought and expect to continue to seek subsidies for our own broadband construction in unserved and underserved areas through programs including rdof and those created pursuant to arpa and , if regulatory requirements are reasonable , the iija . we have been awarded over $ [X] billion in the rdof auction and other federal , state and municipal grants that will partially fund , along with our substantial additional investment , the construction of new broadband infrastructure to more than one million estimated passings . our awards through rdof and arpa include a number of regulatory requirements , such as serving as the carrier of last resort and completing increasingly larger portions of the network construction by certain dates . if we fail to meet these obligations , we could be subject to substantial government penalties . also , the fcc has adopted rules for service providers to report broadband availability , pursuant to the broadband data act . providers are required to report their service areas twice a year . the service areas reported are subject to challenge . a broadband provider who provides inaccurate maps may be subject to enforcement action by the fcc . the fcc can also fine a provider for filing incorrect maps . the market for our internet services is affected by participation in and the general availability of programs that offer federal subsidies for certain low - income consumers for the purchase of internet access service . in [XXXX] , pursuant to congressional appropriation for covid relief , the fcc established a temporary monthly emergency broadband benefit program ( "" ebb "" ) subsidy of up to $ [XX] for most eligible low - income households . with the funding for ebb set to run out , congress in the iija authorized $ [XX.X] billion for the successor acp that provides up to a $ [XX] monthly discount for most eligible customers paid to the household ’s broadband provider . we elected to participate in the ebb and acp , and the fcc regulates many of the terms on which we provide acp services , including restrictions on our ability to refuse service to prospective eligible customers based upon their credit or payment history . the fcc 's enforcement bureau or office of inspector general can also audit our acp customer base and could assess fines or recoup subsidies if our customer qualifications were inappropriate . the acp discount enables eligible households to purchase our spectrum internet assist and other promotional broadband service tiers at no cost to them . existing acp funding is expected to run out in april [XXXX] , and we can not predict whether congress or the fcc will provide additional funding to extend the acp , or on what terms . wireline voice service the fcc has never classified the voip wireline telephone services we offer as “ telecommunications services ” that are subject to traditional federal common carrier regulation , but instead has imposed some of these regulatory requirements on a case - by - case basis , such as requirements relating to [XXX] emergency services ( “ e911 ” ) , communications assistance for law enforcement act ( “ calea ” ) ( the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communications ) , universal service fund contributions , customer privacy and customer proprietary network information ( “ cpni ” ) protections , number portability , network and/or [XXX] outage reporting , rural call completion , disability access , regulatory fees , back - up power , robocall mitigation and discontinuance of service . it is possible that the fcc or congress will impose additional federal requirements on our voip telephone services in the future . our voip telephone services are subject to certain state and local regulatory fees such as e911 fees and contributions to state universal service funds . additionally , in california and new york and to comply with rdof program requirements , we have chosen in the rdof areas to offer lifeline voip telephone services subject to traditional federal and state common carrier regulations . except where we have chosen to offer voip telephone services in such a manner , we believe that our voip telephone services should be governed primarily by federal regulation . a federal appellate court affirmed our successful challenge to minnesota 's attempt to generally apply telephone regulation to our voip services , but that ruling is limited to the seven states in the 8th circuit . some states have attempted to subject cable voip services , such as our voip telephone service , to state level regulation . california has imposed reporting and other obligations on our voip services , including backup power requirements , and has proposed the imposition of service quality metrics on voip services . california is also currently assessing requiring providers of voip services to comply with new registration and/or certification requirements in order to conduct business in the state . we have registered with or obtained certificates or authorizations from the fcc and the state regulatory authorities in those states in which we offer competitive voice services in order to ensure the continuity of our services . however , it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved . state regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our fixed wireline voice telephone services . mobile service our spectrum mobile service offers mobile internet access and telephone service . we provide this service as a mobile virtual network operator ( "" mvno "" ) using verizon ’s network and our network through spectrum wifi . as an mvno , we are subject to many of the same fcc regulations that apply to facilities - based wireless carriers , as well as certain state or local regulations , including ( but not limited to ): e911 , local number portability , customer privacy , calea , universal service fund contribution , robocall mitigation and hearing aid compatibility and safety and emission requirements for mobile devices . spectrum mobile ’s broadband internet access service is also subject to the fcc ’s transparency rule and will be subject to the new labeling rules scheduled to become applicable to us in april [XXXX] . the fcc or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for mvnos and/or mobile service providers in the future , or impose new taxes or fees applicable to spectrum mobile , which could adversely affect the service offering or our business generally . for example , california has proposed the imposition of service quality metrics on mobile services . privacy and information security regulation the communications act limits our ability to collect , use , and disclose customers ’ personally identifiable information for our internet , video and voice services . we are subject to additional federal , state , and local laws and regulations that impose additional restrictions on the collection , use and disclosure of consumer information . all broadband providers are also obliged by calea to configure their networks in a manner that facilitates the ability of state and federal law enforcement , with proper legal process authorized under the electronic communications privacy act , to wiretap and obtain records and information concerning our customers , including the content of their communications . further , the fcc , federal trade commission ( “ ftc ” ) , and many states regulate and restrict the marketing practices of communications service providers , including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial emails . the ftc currently has the authority , pursuant to its general authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive acts and practices , to protect the privacy of internet service customers , including our use and disclosure of certain customer information . our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security . all states have data breach notification laws that would require us to inform individuals and regulators in the event of a breach that could impact personal information of our customers . in the event of an information security breach , such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of monetary forfeitures . the fcc , the ftc and state attorneys general regularly bring enforcement actions against companies related to information security breaches and privacy violations . various security standards provide guidance to telecommunications companies in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks . we describe those standards in item 1c . cybersercurity - risk management and strategy . the fcc is considering expansion of its cybersecurity guidelines or the adoption of cybersecurity requirements . the department of homeland security ’s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency is also developing cyber incident reporting rules , pursuant to [XXXX] legislative requirements , that require critical infrastructure entities to report substantial cyber incidents within [XX] hours of their discovery . many states and local authorities have considered legislative or other actions that would impose restrictions on our ability to collect , use and disclose , and safeguard certain consumer information . many states have enacted comprehensive consumer data privacy laws , and some states have enacted issue - specific privacy laws covering health information and children 's information . for example , the california consumer privacy act ( “ ccpa ” ) became effective on january [X] , [XXXX] . the ccpa , under certain circumstances , regulates companies ’ use and disclosure of the personal information of california residents and authorizes enforcement actions by the california attorney general and private class actions for data breaches . in addition , effective january [X] , [XXXX] , the california consumer privacy rights act ( “ cpra ” ) amended ccpa to impose additional obligations on companies that handle the personal information of california residents and the california privacy protection agency ( "" cppa "" ) issued specific regulations implementing provisions of the ccpa and cpra effective in [XXXX] and [XXXX] . the maine act to protect privacy of online customer information , which regulates how internet service providers use and disclose customers ’ personal information and requires internet service providers to take reasonable measures to protect customers ’ personal information , became effective on july [X] , [XXXX] . virginia , colorado and connecticut 's new privacy laws became effective in [XXXX] , and utah 's new privacy law became effective on december [XX] , [XXXX] . new comprehensive data privacy laws are scheduled to become effective in florida , oregon and texas on july [X] , [XXXX] , in montana on october [X] , [XXXX] , in iowa and delaware on january [X] , [XXXX] , in new jersey on january [X] , [XXXX] , in tennessee on july [X] , [XXXX] , and in indiana on january [X] , [XXXX] . each of these laws will regulate the way that companies collect , use , and share personal information about consumers . several other state legislatures are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for our business . the ftc has an ongoing advance notice of proposed rulemaking ( “ anpr ” ) to explore rules related to the collection , analysis , and monetization of consumers ' information , as well as companies ' data security practices and related disclosures to consumers . congress may also adopt new privacy and data security obligations . we can not predict whether any of these efforts will be successful , challenged , upheld , vacated , or preempted , or how new legislation and regulations , if any , would affect our business . human capital management as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had approximately [XXX,XXX] active full - time equivalent employees . the vast majority of our employees sell or service our products . we believe that attracting , developing and retaining our highly - skilled workforce is critical to successfully executing our operating strategy . with competitive wages , robust and affordable healthcare benefits , a generous retirement program with company match , and opportunities for job training and advancement , our employees develop skills and expertise necessary to build a long and successful career with us . in addition , the diversity of the communities we serve is reflected in our workforce , and our success in serving these communities requires a commitment to diversity and inclusion in every aspect of our business . we value the unique backgrounds , perspectives , and experiences of our employees . embracing these differences brings us together for the common mission of exceeding our customers ’ needs . there are several ways in which we attract , develop , and retain highly qualified talent , including : pay and benefits • we provide compensation packages that are market competitive , taking into account the location and responsibilities of the role . • all hourly employees have a starting minimum wage of at least $ [XX] per hour , which is well above any state or federal minimum wage level . • nearly [XX] % of our employees are eligible for additional variable compensation based on their performance , including annual bonus eligibility for all frontline supervisors and other salaried employees not already on a sales commission or bonus plan . • we offer enhanced career progression opportunities . • we provide high - quality , comprehensive medical , dental , and vision coverage for all full - time and part - time employees . it is our priority to keep this coverage affordable for our employees and their families , and so for the last eleven years , we have absorbed the full premium cost increase for medical , dental , and vision coverage . • we provide competitive financial benefits to all employees such as a 401(k ) plan with a dollar for dollar company match up to [X] % of their eligible pay . in addition , most of our employees are also eligible to receive an additional non - elective contribution to a retirement accumulation plan equal to [X] % of their eligible pay . • we have a stock incentive plan and grant equity awards to eligible employees on an annual basis . training and development • the substantial skills , experience and industry knowledge of our employees and our training of our customer - facing employees benefit our operations and performance . we offer thousands of learning experiences spanning leadership development , new hire , and professional skills training both online and in the classroom . • in [XXXX] , we introduced a new tuition - free degree and certificate program , removing the financial barrier for employees to continue their education through convenient online learning . • we also provide traditional tuition reimbursement of up to $ [XX,XXX] per year for employees who want to pursue other outside programs . • the vast majority of our customer - facing roles have the opportunity for upward advancement including through supervisory and leadership roles . our field operations organization has a formalized self - progression structure where employees who maintain exceptional levels of performance can complete online coursework to advance to next level within their job family . • our broadband technician apprenticeship program is one of our promising strategies for building our skilled workforce . this program , certified by the u.s . department of labor , is aligned with our broadband technician career progression

and retain customers and can adversely affect our business , operations and financial results . the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years . in some instances , we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens , access to better financing and greater and more favorable brand name recognition . increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and content industries have provided additional benefits to certain of our competitors , either through access to financing , resources , or efficiencies of scale including the ability to launch new products and services . our internet service faces competition from other companies ’ ftth , fixed wireless broadband , internet delivered via satellite and dsl services . various operators offer wireless internet services delivered over networks which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speeds and also continue to expand [X] g mobile services . our voice and mobile services compete with wireless and wireline phone providers , as well as other forms of communication , such as text , instant messaging , social networking services , video conferencing and email . competition from these companies , including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing , may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers . our video service faces competition from a number of sources , including dbs services , and companies that deliver linear network programming , movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband internet connections to televisions , computers , tablets and mobile devices often with password sharing among multiple users and security that makes content susceptible to piracy . newer products and services , particularly alternative methods for the distribution , sale and viewing of content may continue to be developed , further increasing the number of competitors that we face . the increasing number of choices available to audiences , including low - cost or free choices , could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our products and services , but also advertisers ’ willingness to purchase advertising from us . we compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television networks and stations , as well as other advertising platforms , such as online media , radio and print . competition related to our service offerings to businesses continues to increase as well , as more companies deploy more fiber to more buildings , which may negatively impact our growth and put pressure on margins . a failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies ( including those that use artificial intelligence ( "" ai "" ) ) and changes in customer expectations and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position with respect to the leisure time and discretionary spending of our customers and , as a result , affect our business and results of operations . competition may also reduce our expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirements , including debt service requirements . for additional information regarding the competition we face , see “ item [X] . business -competition ” and “ -regulation and legislation . ” we depend on third - party service providers , suppliers and licensors ; thus , if we are unable to procure the necessary services , equipment , software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis , our ability to offer services could be impaired , and our growth , operations , business , financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected . we depend on a limited number of third - party service providers , suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services , hardware , software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services and execute our network evolution and rural construction initiatives . some of our hardware , software and operational support vendors and service providers represent our sole source of supply or have , either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights , a position of some exclusivity . our ability to provide some services and complete our network evolution and rural construction initiatives might be materially adversely affected , or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might interrupt or delay our ability to serve existing and new customers , if any of these parties experience or engage in the following : • breach or terminate or elect not to renew their agreements with us or otherwise fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner ; • demand exceeds these vendors ’ capacity ; • tariffs are imposed that impact vendors ’ ability to perform their obligations or significantly increase the amount we pay ; • experience operating or financial difficulties ; • significantly increase the amount we are required to pay ( including demands for substantial non - monetary compensation ) for necessary products or services ; or • cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand , profitability or a change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner at our specifications and at reasonable prices . in addition , the existence of only a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs . any of these events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and our operations , business , financial results and financial condition . we may not have the ability to pass on to our customers all of the increases in programming costs , which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating margins . programming costs are one of our largest expense items . our programming costs have historically increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost - of - living type increases . while decreases in video customers combined with a change in the mix of customers choosing lower cost packages have offset total programming cost increases , we expect contractual programming rates per service subscriber to continue to increase as a result of annual increases pursuant to our programming contracts and contract renewals with programmers . although we pass along amounts paid for local broadcast station retransmission consent to the majority of our customers , the inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to our customers has had , and is expected in the future to have , an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product . additionally , the demands of large media companies , with additional selling power as a result of media and broadcast station group consolidation , who link carriage of their most popular networks to carriage and cost increases of their less popular networks , and require us to carry their most popular networks to a large percentage of our video subscribers , have limited our flexibility in selling more tailored and cost - sensitive programming packages for consumers . in order to mitigate impacts to our operating margins due to increasing programming rates , we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategies . further , some programmers have begun to simulcast and/or move popular programming to dtc apps which , in some cases , are no longer accessible by our customers through their current video subscription , despite increasing rates , driving customer dissatisfaction and in turn , customer losses . we are seeking to obtain access to these dtc apps , where applicable , as we renew agreements , so that we may include in our customers ' video subscriptions . increases in the cost of sports programming and the amounts paid for local broadcast station retransmission - consent have been the largest contributors to the growth in our programming costs over the last few years . federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between “ must - carry ” rights and an alternative “ retransmission - consent ” regime . when a station opts for the retransmission - consent regime , we are not allowed to carry the station ’s signal without that station ’s permission . in retransmission - consent negotiations , broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest . carriage of these other services , as well as increased fees for retransmission rights , may increase our programming expenses which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results . our programming contracts are generally for a fixed period of time , with potentially significant spend subject to negotiated renewal in any particular year . we will seek to renew these agreements on terms that we believe are favorable . there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms . to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable , we have been , and may in the future be , forced to remove such programming channels from our line - up , which may result in a loss of customers . any failure to carry programming that is attractive to our customers could adversely impact our customer levels , operations and financial results . any failure to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively . we operate in a highly competitive , consumer - driven and rapidly changing environment . from time to time , we may pursue strategic initiatives to launch products or enhancements to our products . our success is , to a large extent , dependent on our ability to acquire , develop , adopt , upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers ’ changing demands and distinguish our services from those of our competitors . we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services . if we choose technologies or equipment that are less effective , cost - efficient or attractive to customers than those chosen by our competitors , if technologies or equipment on which we have chosen to rely cease to be available to us on reasonable terms or conditions , if we offer services that fail to appeal to consumers , are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected , if we are not able to fund the expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments , or if we are no longer able to make our services available to our customers on a third - party device on which a substantial number of customers have relied to access our services , our competitive position could deteriorate , and our business and financial results could suffer . the ability of some of our competitors to introduce new technologies , products and services more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position . furthermore , advances in technology , decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors ’ product and service offerings may require us in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer , at no additional charge or at a lower price , certain products and services that we currently offer to customers separately or at a premium . in addition , the uncertainty of our ability , and the costs , to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties could impact our ability to respond to technological advances in a timely and effective manner . any failure to maintain and expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner , or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace , could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers . in addition , as we continue to grow our mobile services using virtual network operator rights from a third party , we expect continued growth - related sales and marketing and other customer acquisition costs as well as negative working capital impacts from the timing of device - related cash flows when we provide devices pursuant to equipment installation plans . we also continue to consider and pursue opportunities in the mobile space which may include the acquisition of additional licensed spectrum and may include entering into or expanding joint ventures or partnerships with wireless or cable providers which may require significant investment . for example , we now hold cbrs pals to support existing and future mobile services . these licenses are subject to revocation and expiration . although we expect to be able to maintain and renew these licenses , the loss of one or more licenses could significantly impair our ability to offload mobile traffic and achieve cost reductions . if we are unable to continue to grow our mobile business and achieve the outcomes we expect from our investments in the mobile business , our growth , financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected . our business may be adversely affected if we can not continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends . we rely on patent , copyright , trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees , customers , suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operations . also , because of the rapid pace of technological change , we both develop our own technologies , products and services and rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties . however , any of our intellectual property rights , or the rights of our suppliers , could be challenged or invalidated , or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages , which could result in costly redesign efforts , discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm . we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms , if at all . in addition , claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms , incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question , which could require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively . even unsuccessful claims can be time - consuming and costly to defend and may divert management ’s attention and resources away from our business . infringement claims continue to be brought frequently in the communications and entertainment industries , and we are also often a party to such litigation alleging that certain of our services or technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others . various events could disrupt or result in unauthorized access to our networks , information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation and financial results . network and information systems technologies are critical to our operating activities , both for our internal uses , such as network management , and supplying services to our customers , including customer service operations and programming delivery . network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by events such as computer hacking , phishing , dissemination of computer viruses , worms and other destructive or disruptive software , “ cyber attacks ” such as ransomware , process breakdowns , denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks . both unsuccessful and successful “ cyber attacks ” on companies have continued to increase in frequency , scope and potential harm in recent years , and the increasing use of ai may intensify these cybersecurity risks . while we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems - related events and security breaches from occurring , the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently . we , and the third parties on which we rely , may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures . while from time to time attempts have been made to access our network , these events have not as yet resulted in any material release of information , degradation or disruption to our network and information systems . our network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages , telecommunications failures , accidents , natural disasters ( including extreme weather arising from short - term or any long - term changes in weather patterns ) , terrorist attacks and similar events . our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate , and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities . any of these events , if directed at , or experienced by , us or technologies upon which we depend , could have adverse consequences on our network , our customers and our business , including degradation of service , service disruption , excessive call volume to call centers , and damage to our or our customers ’ equipment and data . large expenditures may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property , networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future . moreover , the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result . any such significant service disruption could result in damage to our reputation and credibility , customer dissatisfaction and ultimately a loss of customers or revenue . any significant loss of customers or revenue , or significant increase in costs of serving those customers , could adversely affect our growth , financial condition and results of operations . furthermore , our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation , misuse , leakage , falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third - party vendors , including customer , personnel and vendor data . we provide certain confidential , proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our business , and there is a risk that this information may be compromised . we process , store , and transmit large amounts of data , including the personal information of our customers . ongoing increases in the potential for misuse of personal information , the public ’s awareness of the importance of safeguarding personal information , and the volume of legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection , privacy and security of personal information have resulted in increases to our information - related risks . we could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize , and such events could damage our reputation , credibility and business and have a negative impact on our revenue . we could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by consumers in private litigations involving privacy issues related to consumer data collection and use practices . we also could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach . issues related to the development and use of ai could give rise to legal or regulatory action , damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business . we currently incorporate ai technology in certain parts of our business operations . our research and development of such technology remains ongoing . ai presents risks , challenges and unintended consequences that could affect our and our customers ’ adoption and use of this technology . ai algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed . additionally , ai technologies are complex and rapidly evolving . while we aim to develop and use ai responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use , we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise . ai - related issues , deficiencies or failures could give rise to legal or regulatory action , including with respect to proposed legislation regulating ai or as a result of new applications of existing data protection , privacy , intellectual property and other laws , and could damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business . our exposure to the economic conditions of our current and potential customers , vendors and third parties could adversely affect our cash flow , results of operations and financial condition . we are exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of our current and potential customers , the potential financial instability of our customers and their financial ability to purchase our products . if there were a prolonged general economic downturn , we may experience increased cancellations or non - payment by our customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased . this may include an increase in the number of homes that replace their video service with internet - delivered or over - air content , as well as an increase in the number of internet and voice customers substituting mobile data and voice products for wireline services , which would negatively impact our ability to attract customers , increase rates and maintain or increase revenue . in addition , our ability to gain new customers is dependent to some extent on growth in occupied housing in our service areas , which is influenced by both national and local economic conditions . weak economic conditions may also have a negative impact on our advertising revenue . these events have adversely affected us in the past , and may adversely affect our cash flow , results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to continue . in addition , we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we outsource certain functions . the same economic conditions that may affect our customers , as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets , also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices , reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely . further , inflationary pressures may impact the ability of vendors and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us . any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our cash flow , results of operation and financial condition . if we are unable to retain key employees , our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected . our operational results have depended , and our future results will depend , upon the retention and continued performance of our management team . our ability to hire and retain key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications and technology industries . the loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results . risks related to our indebtedness we have a significant amount of debt and expect to incur significant additional debt , including secured debt , in the future , which could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to react to changes in our business . we have a significant amount of debt and expect to ( subject to applicable restrictions in our debt instruments ) incur additional debt in the future as charter maintains its stated objective of [X.X] to [X.X] times adjusted ebitda leverage ( net debt divided by the last twelve months adjusted ebitda ) . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , our total principal amount of debt was approximately $ [XX.X] billion and charter 's leverage ratio was [X.XX] times adjusted ebitda . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , $ [XX.X] billion of our debt was rated investment grade and $ [XX.X] billion was rated high yield debt . this split rating allows us to access both the investment grade debt market and the high yield debt market . our significant amount of debt could have adverse consequences , such as : • impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates , or at all ; • make us vulnerable to interest rate increases , in part because approximately [XX] % of our borrowings as of december [XX] , [XXXX] were , and may continue to be , subject to variable rates of interest ; • expose us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt ; • require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to make payments on our debt , reducing our funds available for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes ; • limit our flexibility in planning for , or reacting to , changes in our business , the cable and telecommunications industries , and the economy at large ; • place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt ; and • adversely affect our relationship with customers and suppliers . to the extent our current debt amounts increase more than expected , our operating results are lower than expected , or credit rating agencies downgrade our debt thereby increasing our costs of borrowing and potentially limiting our access to investment grade markets , the related risks that we now face will intensify . the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business , as well as significantly affect our liquidity . the indentures governing the cco holdings , llc ( “ cco holdings ” ) notes contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our operations , liquidity and results of operations . these covenants restrict , among other things , cco holdings , cco holdings capital corp . and all of their restricted subsidiaries ’ ability to : • incur additional debt ; • pay dividends on equity or repurchase equity ; • make investments ; • sell all or substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other companies ; • sell assets ; • in the case of restricted subsidiaries , create or permit to exist dividend or payment restrictions with respect to cco holdings , guarantee their parent companies ' debt , or issue specified equity interests ; • engage in certain transactions with affiliates ; and • grant liens ( with respect to only cco holdings ) . additionally , the charter communications operating , llc ( "" charter operating "" ) credit facilities require charter operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant . the charter operating credit facilities , the charter operating notes , the time warner cable , llc ( "" twc , llc "" ) senior notes and debentures , and the time warner cable enterprises , llc ( "" twce "" ) debentures include customary negative covenants , including restrictions on the ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and consolidating , merging or conveying or transferring substantially all of the respective obligor ’s assets . the breach of any covenants or obligations in our indentures or credit facilities , not otherwise waived or amended , could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations , which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our long - term indebtedness . in addition , the secured lenders under our secured notes and the charter operating credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral , which includes equity interests in substantially all of our subsidiaries , and exercise other rights of secured creditors . risks related to ownership position of liberty broadband corporation and advance / newhouse partnership liberty broadband corporation ( “ liberty broadband ” ) and advance / newhouse partnership ( “ a / n ” ) have governance rights that give them influence over corporate transactions and other matters . liberty broadband currently owns a significant amount of charter class a common stock and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to charter . a / n currently owns charter class a common stock and a significant amount of membership interests in our subsidiary , charter holdings , which are convertible into charter class a common stock , and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to charter . members of charter 's board of directors include a director who is also an officer and director of liberty broadband and directors who are current or former officers and directors of a / n. mr . greg maffei is the president and chief executive officer of liberty broadband . steven miron is the chief executive officer of a / n and michael newhouse is co - president of the parent of a / n and its affiliates . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , liberty broadband beneficially held approximately [XX.XX] % of charter ’s voting stock and a / n beneficially held approximately [XX.XX] % of charter ’s voting stock . pursuant to the amended and restated stockholders agreement among charter , liberty broadband and a / n , dated as of may [XX] , [XXXX] ( as amended , the “ stockholders agreement ” ) , liberty broadband currently has the right to designate up to three directors as nominees for charter ’s board of directors and a / n currently has the right to designate up to two directors as nominees for charter ’s board of directors . each of a / n and liberty broadband is entitled to nominate at least one director to each of the committees of charter 's board of directors , subject to applicable stock exchange listing rules and certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds for each of a / n and liberty broadband , and provided that the nominating and corporate governance committee and the compensation and benefits committee each have at least a majority of directors independent from a / n , liberty broadband and charter ( referred to as the “ unaffiliated directors ” in the stockholders agreement ) . the stockholders agreement and charter ’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation fixes the size of the board at [XX] directors . liberty broadband and a / n are required to vote ( subject to the applicable voting cap ) their respective shares of charter class a common stock and charter class b common stock for the director nominees nominated by the nominating and corporate governance committee , including the respective designees of liberty broadband and a / n , and against any other nominees , except that , with respect to the unaffiliated directors , liberty broadband and a / n must instead vote in the same proportion as the voting securities are voted by stockholders other than a / n and liberty broadband or any group which includes any of them are voted , if doing so would cause a different outcome with respect to the unaffiliated directors . as a result of their rights under the stockholders agreement and their significant equity and voting stakes in charter , liberty broadband and/or a / n , who may have interests different from those of other stockholders , will be able to exercise substantial influence over certain matters relating to the governance of charter , including the approval of significant corporate actions , such as mergers and other business combination transactions . the stockholders agreement provides a / n and liberty broadband with preemptive rights with respect to issuances of charter equity in connection with certain transactions , and in the event that a / n or liberty broadband exercises these rights , holders of charter class a common stock may experience further dilution . the stockholders agreement provides that a / n and liberty broadband will have certain contractual preemptive rights over issuances of charter equity securities in connection with capital raising transactions . holders of charter class a common stock will not be entitled to similar preemptive rights with respect to such transactions . as a result , if liberty broadband and/or a / n elect to exercise their preemptive rights , ( i ) these parties would not experience the dilution experienced by the other holders of charter class a common stock , and ( ii ) such other holders of charter class a common stock may experience further dilution of their interest in charter upon such exercise . risks related to regulatory and legislative matters our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation , which could adversely affect our business . the services we offer are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can increase operational and administrative expenses and reduce revenues , including those covering the following : • the provision of high - speed internet service , including network management , broadband label , broadband availability reporting , digital discrimination and transparency rules ; • the provision of fixed and mobile voice communications , including rules for emergency communications , network and/or [XXX] outage reporting , cpni safeguards and reporting , local number portability , efforts to limit unwanted robocalls , and , for mobile devices , hearing aid compatibility , safety and emission requirements ; • the fees that must be included in our advertised prices and bills , and the means by which our customers can cancel services ; • access by law enforcement ; • cable franchise renewals and transfers ; • the provisioning , marketing and billing of cable and internet equipment ; • customer and employee privacy and data security ; • copyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals ; • the circumstances when a cable system must carry a broadcast station and the circumstances when it first must obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station ; • limitations on our ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control our inside wiring ; • equal employment opportunity ; • the resiliency of our networks to maintain service during and after disasters and power outages ; • emergency alert systems , disability access , pole attachments , commercial leased access and technical standards ; • marketing practices , customer service , and consumer protection ; and • approval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant ’s business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction . legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing , and sometimes do change , existing statutes , rules , regulations , or interpretations thereof , or prescribe new ones . any future legislative , judicial , regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses . changes to the existing legal and regulatory framework under which we operate or the regulatory programs in which we or our competitors participate , including the possible elimination of the federal broadband acp subsidy for low - income consumers , could adversely affect our business . there are ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal , state and local regulation of some of the services offered over our cable systems , particularly our retail broadband internet access service . potential legislative and regulatory changes could adversely impact our business by increasing our costs and competition and limiting our ability to offer services in a manner that would maximize our revenue potential . these changes have in the past , and could in the future , include , for example , the reclassification of internet services as regulated telecommunications services or other utility - style regulation of internet services ; restrictions on how we manage our internet access services and networks ; the adoption of new customer service or service quality requirements for our internet access services ; the adoption of new privacy restrictions on our collection , use and disclosure of certain customer information ; new data security and cybersecurity mandates that could result in additional network and information security and cyber incident reporting requirements for our business ; new restraints on our discretion over programming decisions ; new restrictions on the rates we charge to consumers for one or more of the services or equipment options we offer ; changes to the cable industry ’s compulsory copyright to retransmit broadcast signals ; new requirements to assure the availability of navigation devices from third - party providers ; new universal service fund contribution obligations on our internet service revenues that would add to the cost of that service ; increases in government - administered broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our facilities ; changes to the fcc ’s administration of spectrum ; pending court challenges to the legality of the fcc ’s universal service programs , which , if successful , could adversely affect our receipt of universal service funds , including but not limited to fcc rdof grants to expand our network , fcc e - rate funds to serve schools and libraries and fcc rural health care funds to serve eligible health care providers ; and changes in the regulatory framework for voip telephone service , including the scope of regulatory obligations associated with our voip telephone service and our ability to interconnect our voip telephone service with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications service . we participate in the federal acp that provides up to a $ [XX] monthly subsidy enabling eligible low - income households to purchase our internet products at a discount or , for a portion of those households , at no cost . the fcc has announced that acp funding is expected to run out in april [XXXX] and has prohibited service providers from enrolling new acp customers after february [X] , [XXXX] . if congress does not provide additional funding , this will be disruptive to our business . we will lose customers and revenues and could face greater difficulty in providing services to low - income households in the future . as a winning bidder in the fcc ’s rdof auction in [XXXX] , we must comply with numerous fcc and state requirements to continue receiving such funding . to comply with these requirements , in rdof areas , we have chosen to offer certain of our voip telephone services , such as our lifeline services , subject to certain traditional federal and state common carrier regulations . additionally , in some areas where we are building pursuant to subsidy programs , we will offer certain of our broadband internet access services subject to required discounts and other marketing - related terms . if we fail to comply with those requirements , the governing regulatory agency could consider us in default and we could incur substantial penalties or forfeitures . if we fail to attain certain specified infrastructure build - out requirements under the rdof program , the fcc could also withhold future support payments until those shortcomings are corrected . any failure to comply with the rules and requirements of a subsidy grant could result in us being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time , which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . if any laws or regulations are enacted that would expand the regulation of our services , they could affect our operations and require significant expenditures . we can not predict future developments in these areas , and any changes to the regulatory framework for our internet , video , mobile or voip services could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations . it remains uncertain what rule changes , if any , will ultimately be adopted by congress , the fcc , the ftc and state legislatures , and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on us , including on the operation of our broadband networks , customer privacy and the user experience . in addition , the fcc , the ftc , and various state agencies and attorney generals actively investigate industry practices and could impose substantial forfeitures for alleged regulatory violations . tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax and fee positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . we offer services and operate cable systems in locations throughout the united states and , as a result , we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal , state and local governments . from time to time , legislative and administrative bodies change laws and regulations that change our effective tax rate or tax payments . certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on our services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed . potential changes include additional taxes or fees on our services which could impact our customers , changes to income tax sourcing rules and other changes to general business taxes , central / unit - level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase our income , franchise , sales , use and/or property tax liabilities . in addition , federal , state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations . there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by

for - profit cooperatives owned by the member companies wherein we may actively participate as a member of the board of directors , steering committee , work group or other supporting role . in north america , our primary osros include the marine spill response corporation for the continental u.s . and alaska clean seas and ship escort / response vessel system for the alaska north slope and prince william sound , respectively . internationally , we maintain memberships in various osros including oil spill response limited , the norwegian clean seas association for operating companies , australian marine oil spill center and petroleum industry of malaysia mutual aid group . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start business and properties # # table_end technology we have several technology programs that improve our ability to develop unconventional reservoirs , increase recoveries from our legacy fields , improve the efficiency of our exploration program , produce heavy oil economically with lower emissions and implement sustainability measures . lng liquefaction we are the second - largest lng liquefaction technology provider globally . our optimized cascade ® lng liquefaction technology has been licensed for use in [XX] lng trains around the world , with feed studies ongoing for additional trains . low - carbon technologies in [XXXX] , we established a multi - disciplinary low - carbon technologies organization , with the remit to support our net - zero ambition , understand the alternative energy landscape and prioritize opportunities for future competitive investment . we continue our focus on implementing emissions reduction projects across our global portfolio , including operational efficiency measures and methane and flaring reductions . in april [XXXX] , we accelerated our [XXXX] ghg emissions intensity reduction target to a [XX] - [XX] percent reduction by [XXXX] from a [XXXX] baseline on both a gross operated and net equity basis . in addition , we set a new near - zero methane intensity target of less than [X.X] - kilogram carbon dioxide equivalent per boe by [XXXX] . we are also on track to meet the world bank zero routine flaring goal by [XXXX] . to help achieve these targets , the low - carbon technologies organization continued to work with the company 's business units to develop and implement region - specific emission reduction initiatives and identify potential technology solutions for hard - to - abate emissions . over the last two years , we continued our work to identify additional pathways to abate our scope [X] and [X] emissions as well as low - carbon opportunities for future competitive investment . for example : • we conducted ccs and electrification studies , initiated zero / low emission equipment design enhancements , installed mechanisms to continuously monitor and detect methane emissions and implemented operational changes to reduce flaring and methane venting volumes . • we evaluated carbon dioxide storage sites primarily along the u.s . gulf coast , progressed land acquisition efforts and business development work , initiated permitting activities for potential appraisal wells for carbon sequestration and advanced engineering studies for multiple opportunities . • we advanced hydrogen opportunities in the u.s . , middle east and asia pacific regions . in september [XXXX] , jera and uniper announced a non - binding heads of agreement together with conocophillips , for the potential sale of ammonia to uniper . this agreement further advanced our cooperation to potentially develop a low - carbon , ammonia production facility on the u.s . gulf coast that would supply low - carbon fuels from the u.s . for use in the u.s . , europe , japan and greater asia . delivery commitments we sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements , some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity . our commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves and the spot market . worldwide , we are contractually committed to deliver approximately [XXX] billion cubic feet of natural gas , [XXX] million barrels of crude oil and [XX.X] million megawatt hours of electricity in the future . these contracts have various expiration dates through the year [XXXX] . we expect to fulfill these delivery commitments with third -

planning needs and assess the availability of critical skill sets within the company . we use a performance management program focused on objectivity , credibility and transparency . the program includes broad stakeholder feedback , real - time monetary and non - monetary recognition and a formal “ how ” rating to assess behaviors to ensure they align with our spirit values . we empower our employees to grow their careers through personal and professional development opportunities , including individual development plans , annual career development conversations with supervisors , a voluntary [XXX] - feedback tool and training on a broad range of technical and professional skills . succession planning is a top priority for management and the board of directors . this work ensures we have the talent available for critical leadership roles and serves to inspire employees to reach their ultimate potential and limit business interruption . taking steps to measure and assess employee satisfaction and engagement is at the heart of long - term business success and creating a great place to work for our global workforce . since [XXXX] , the conocophillips perspectives survey has become our primary listening platform for gathering feedback on employee sentiment and promoting our “ who we are ” culture . our leadership reviews the survey feedback to guide priorities and goals . our employee feedback strategy is delivered through this annual engagement survey and as needed ; shorter ad hoc surveys are leveraged to unlock targeted insights in support of our human capital priorities . compensation , benefits and well - being we offer competitive , performance - based compensation packages and have global equitable pay practices . our compensation programs are generally comprised of a base pay , the annual variable cash incentive program ( vcip ) and , for eligible employees , the restricted stock unit ( rsu ) program . from the ceo to the frontline worker , every employee participates in vcip , our annual incentive program , which aligns employee compensation with conocophillips ’ success on critical performance metrics and also recognizes individual performance . our rsu program is designed to attract and retain employees , reward performance and align employee interest with stockholders by encouraging stock ownership . our retirement and savings plans are intended to support the financial futures of our employees and are competitive within local markets . we routinely benchmark our global compensation and benefits programs to ensure they are competitive , inclusive , aligned with company culture and allow our employees to meet their individual needs and the needs of their families . we provide flexible work schedules and competitive time off , including parental leave policies in many locations . we also offer employees flexibility through the hybrid office work ( how ) program in all of our global locations , which provides eligible employees a combination of work from both office and home . we also provide coverage for families requiring disability support , elder care and childcare , including onsite childcare , where access locally is a challenge . our global wellness programs include biometric screenings and fitness challenges designed to educate and promote a healthy lifestyle . all employees have access to our employee assistance program , and many of our locations offer custom programs to support mental well - being . compensation risk mitigation we have considered the risks associated with each of our executive and broad - based compensation programs and policies . as part of the analysis , we considered the performance measures we use as well as the different types of compensation , varied performance measurement periods and extended vesting schedules that we utilize under each incentive compensation program . as a result of this review , management concluded that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company . as part of the board of directors ’ oversight of our risk management programs , the human resources compensation committee ( hrcc ) conducts a similar review with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant . the hrcc agrees with management ’s conclusion that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # #

carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form [XX] - k. these risk factors are not the only risks we face . our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial . if any of these risks or other risks that are yet unknown or currently considered immaterial were to occur , our business , operating results and financial condition , as well as the value of an investment in our common stock , could be materially and adversely affected . risks related to our industry our operating results , our ability to execute on our strategy and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices or prolonged periods of low commodity prices . among the most significant factors impacting our revenues , operating results and future rate of growth are the sales prices for crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngl . these prices are tied to market prices that can fluctuate widely , and many of the factors influencing the prices are beyond our control . for example , over the course of [XXXX] , wti crude oil prices ranged from a low of $ [XX] per barrel in march to a high of $ [XX] per barrel in august . given the volatility in commodity price drivers and the worldwide political and economic environment , including potential economic slowdowns or recessions , unexpected shocks to supply and demand resulting from future global health crises such as those experienced in connection with the covid-19 pandemic or increased uncertainty generated by recent ( and potential future ) armed hostilities in various oil - producing regions around the globe , prices for crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls may continue to be volatile . prolonged periods of low commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues , operating income , cash flows and liquidity , and may also affect the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock and the amount of shares we elect to acquire as part of our share repurchase program and the timing of such acquisitions . lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can produce economically , thus adversely affecting our proved reserves and reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream fields . prolonged depressed prices may affect strategic decisions related to our operations , including decisions to reduce capital investments or curtail operated production . significant reductions in crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngl prices could also require us to reduce our capital expenditures , impair the carrying value of our assets or discontinue the classification of certain assets as proved reserves . although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments or estimated change to our unit - of - production rates at this time , our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result . unless we successfully develop resources , the scope of our business will decline , resulting in an adverse impact to our business . as we produce crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls from our existing portfolio , the amount of our remaining reserves declines . if we do not successfully replace the resources we produce with good prospects for future organic development or through acquisitions , our business will decline . in addition , our ability to successfully develop our reserves depends on our achievement of a number of operational and strategic objectives , some aspects of which are beyond our control , including navigating political and regulatory challenges to obtain and renew rights to develop and produce hydrocarbons ; reservoir optimization ; bringing long - lead time , capital intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule ; and efficiently and profitably operating mature properties . if we are not successful in developing the resources in our portfolio , our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected . the exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry . the exploration and production of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls is a highly competitive business . we compete with private , public and state - owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business , including to locate , acquire and develop new sources of supply and to produce crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls in an efficient , cost - effective manner . in addition , as the energy transition progresses , we anticipate the oil and gas industry will face additional competition from alternative fuels . we must also compete for the materials , equipment , services , employees and other personnel ( including geologists , geophysicists , engineers and other specialists ) necessary to conduct our business . if we are not successful in any facet of this competition , our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end our ability to successfully execute on our energy transition plans is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may be costly to achieve . in [XXXX] , we announced our paris - aligned climate risk framework , including an ambition to achieve net - zero operational emissions by [XXXX] . in [XXXX] , we published our plan for the net - zero energy transition ( the “ plan ” ) and continued to set increasingly ambitious targets around operational ghg emissions intensity and reducing methane emissions and flaring . our ability to achieve stated targets , goals and ambitions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties out of our control , government policies and markets , as well as potential regulations that may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans . such achievement also depends on the accelerated pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies , and the actual pace of development may be inadequate , or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient . furthermore , we are still in the planning stages , and the plan 's execution could be costly , may have unforeseen obstacles , may proceed at varying paces during the timeframe allotted for the plan and may be accomplished in a manner that we can not predict at this time . we may be required to purchase emission credits in the future , and there may be an insufficient supply of offsets to achieve our goals , or we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets . as advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions , we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise our strategies outlined in the plan . we may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end - of - field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets . even if we meet our goals , our efforts may be characterized as insufficient . in [XXXX] , we established our low - carbon technologies organization to identify and evaluate business opportunities that address end - use emissions and early - stage low - carbon technology opportunities that would leverage our existing expertise and adjacencies . our investments in these technologies may expose us to numerous financial , legal , operational , reputational and other risks . while we perform a thorough analysis on these investments , the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve , if any . furthermore , we may not be able to deploy such technologies at a commercial scale . the success of our low - carbon strategy will depend in part upon the cooperation of government agencies , the support of stakeholders , our ability to research and forecast potential investments , and our ability to apply our existing strengths and expertise to new technologies , projects and markets . estimates of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngl reserves are imprecise and may be subject to revision , and any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngl reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves . our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management ’s best estimates based on assumptions , as of a specified date , of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls . such volumes can not be directly measured , and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty . any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur impairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves . future reserve revisions could also result from changes in , among other things , governmental regulation and commodity prices . for more information on estimates used , see the "" critical accountin g estimates "" section of management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . our business may be adversely affected by price controls ; government - imposed limitations on production or exports of crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls ; or the unavailability of adequate gathering , processing , compression , transportation , and pipeline facilities and equipment for our production of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngls . as discussed herein , our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations across numerous jurisdictions . from time to time , regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas and ngl wells below actual production capacity . similarly , in response to increased domestic energy costs , circumstances determined to be in the economic interest of the country , or a declared national emergency , governments could restrict the export or import of our products which would adversely impact our business . because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation , we can not predict whether future restrictions on our business may be enacted or become applicable to us . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls that we produce also depends on the availability , proximity , and capacity of gathering , processing , compression , transportation and pipeline facilities and equipment , as well as any necessary diluents to prepare our crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls for transport . the facilities , equipment and diluents we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions , extreme weather events , permitting delays and other regulatory matters , mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions , many of which are beyond our control . in addition , in certain newer plays , the capacity of necessary facilities , equipment and diluents may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new wells , and construction and permitting delays , permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction , manufacture or other acquisition of new facilities and equipment . if any facilities , equipment or diluents , or any of the transportation methods and channels that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time , we may incur increased costs to transport our crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas and ngls for sale ; we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil , bitumen , natural gas or ngls or we may not be able to meet all the objectives in the plan , such as reducing routine flaring . our ability to manage risk or influence outcomes in joint ventures may be constrained . we conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which another joint venture partner is operator or we may not have majority control . in these cases , the economic , business , or legal interests or goals of the operator or the voting majority may be inconsistent with ours , and we may not be able to influence the decision making or outcomes to align with our interests or goals . failure by an operator or a voting majority , with whom we have a joint venture interest , to adequately manage the risks associated with any operations could have an adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and , in turn , our business and operations . our operations are subject to hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight . our operations are subject to a variety of hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight , such as the monitoring , prevention or mitigation of or protection from explosions , fires , product spills , severe weather , geological events , global health crises , such as epidemics and pandemics , labor disputes , geopolitical tensions , armed hostilities , terrorist or piracy attacks , sabotage , civil unrest or cyberattacks . our operations are subject to additional hazards concerning exposure to and potential release of pollutants and toxic substances , as well as other environmental hazards and risks . for example , offshore activities may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures , water depths and metocean conditions . all such hazards could result in loss of human life , significant property and equipment damage , environmental pollution , impairment of operations , substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation . our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond , or are perceived not to respond , in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity . countermeasures to address global health crises , epidemics or pandemics , including future outbreaks of covid-19 , may result in reduced demand for our products ; disruptions to our supply chain , the global economy or financial or commodity markets ; disruptions in our contractual arrangements with our service providers , suppliers and other counterparties ; failures by our suppliers , contract manufacturers , contractors , joint venture partners and external business partners , to meet their obligations to us ; reduced workforce productivity ; and voluntary or involuntary curtailments . further , our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses described above , and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future or may not be available . in addition , although we design and operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions , to the extent there are significant changes in the earth 's climate , such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets where we operate or the areas where our assets reside , we could incur increased expenses , our operations and supply chain could be adversely impacted and demand for our products could fall . any of these factors , or other cascading effects of such factors , could materially increase our costs ; negatively impact our revenues or ability to implement and advance the plan ; and damage our financial condition , results of operations , cash flows and liquidity position . the full extent and duration of any such impacts can not be predicted at this time because of the lack of certainty surrounding their sources , causes and outcomes . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end legal and regulatory risks we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations . our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment , which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations . for a description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations , see the “ contingencies — environmental ” , “ — climate change ” and "" — company re sponse to climate - related risks "" sections of management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to , among other things : • permits required in connection with exploration , drilling , production and other activities , including those issued by national , subnational , and local authorities ; • the discharge of pollutants into the environment ; • emissions into the atmosphere , such as nitrogen oxides , sulfur dioxide , mercury and ghg emissions , including methane ; • carbon taxes ; • the handling , use , storage , transportation , disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes ; • the dismantlement , abandonment and restoration of historic properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives ; and • exploration and production activities in certain areas , such as offshore environments , arctic fields , oil sands reservoirs and unconventional plays . we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital , operating and maintenance , and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations . in addition , to the extent these expenditures are assumed by a buyer as a result of a disposition , it may result in our incurring substantial costs if the buyer is unable to satisfy these obligations . any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with existing or future laws , regulations and other requirements could result in administrative or civil penalties , criminal fines , other enforcement actions or third - party litigation against us . to the extent these expenditures , as with all costs , are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products , our business , financial condition , results of operations and cash flows in future periods as well as our ability to implement and advance the plan could be adversely affected . existing and future laws , regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate change , such as limitations on ghg emissions , may impact or limit our business plans , result in significant expenditures , promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products . continuing political and societal attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national , regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions , such as cap and trade regimes , specific emission standards , carbon taxes , restrictive permitting , increased fuel efficiency standards , and incentives or mandates for renewable and alternative energy . although we may support the intent of legislative and regulatory measures aimed at addressing climate - related risks , the specifics of how and when they are enacted could result in a material adverse effect to our business , financial condition , results of operations and cash flows in future periods as well as our ability to implement and advance the plan . for example , in december [XXXX] , the epa published a final rule that revises the regulations governing , among other things , the emission of methane and volatile organic compounds from new oil and gas production facilities , and emission guidelines for states to use when revising clean air act implementation plans to limit methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities . the final rule could result in additional capital expenditures and compliance , operating and maintenance costs , any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations . additionally , in [XXXX] , the u.s . joined the international community at the 28th conference of the parties ( cop28 ) , where the u.s . and nearly [XXX] other countries , including most of the countries in which we operate , renewed their commitment to deliver on the aims of the [XXXX] paris agreement . cop28 included a decision on the world 's first ' global stocktake ' to ratchet up climate action before the end of the decade — including a goal to triple renewable energy capacity by [XXXX] — and for the first time its final agreement explicitly recommended "" transitioning away from fossil fuels in the energy system . "" the implementation of current agreements and regulatory measures , as well as any future agreements or measures addressing climate change and ghg emissions , may adversely increase our capital and operating expenses , # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end impact the demand for our products , impose taxes on our products or operations , or require us to purchase emission credits or reduce emissions of ghgs from our operations . for example , in august [XXXX] , the u.s . enacted the inflation reduction act of [XXXX] , which includes a charge on methane emissions from selected facilities in the oil and gas industry , including many of the facilities operated by conocophillips . as a result , we may incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance , operating , maintenance and remediation costs , any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations . for more information on legislation or precursors for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operations and a description of the company 's response , see the "" contingencies — climate change ” and "" — company response to climate -related risks "" sections of management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . broader investor and societal attention to and efforts to address global climate change may limit who can do business with us or our access to financial markets and could subject us to litigation . increasing attention to global climate change has also resulted in pressure from and upon stockholders , financial institutions and other financial market participants to potentially limit or discontinue investments , insurance and funding to oil and gas companies . for example , a significant number of financial institutions are now members of the glasgow financial alliance for net zero ( gfanz ) , thereby pledging to the goal of net zero by [XXXX] , as well as setting interim targets for [XXXX] or earlier . while they are not prohibited from doing business with oil and gas companies , gfanz members may self - impose limits . conversely , we also face pressure from some in the investment community and certain public interest groups to limit the focus on esg in our decision - making , arguing that esg considerations do not relate to financial outcomes . as public pressure continues to mount on the financial sector , our costs of capital may increase . furthermore , increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation , which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business . beginning in [XXXX] and continuing through [XXXX] , cities , counties , governments and other entities in several states / territories in the u.s . have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies , including conocophillips , seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts . additional lawsuits with similar allegations are expected to be filed . the amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal and factual issues involved in these cases are unprecedented . conocophillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless , and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuits . the ultimate outcome and impact to us can not be predicted with certainty , and we expect to incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future . we could also receive lawsuits alleging a failure or lack of diligence to meet our publicly stated esg goals , or alleging misrepresentation related to our esg activity . political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows . actions of the u.s . , state , local and foreign governments , through sanctions , tax and other legislation , executive orders and commercial restrictions , could reduce our operating profitability both in the u.s . and abroad . in certain locations , restrictions on our operations ; leasing restrictions ; special taxes or tax assessments ; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non - disclosure laws of other countries have been imposed or proposed by governments or certain interest groups . in addition , we may face regulatory changes in the u.s . including , but not limited to , the enactment of tax law changes that adversely affect the fossil fuel industry , new methane emissions standards , requirements restricting or prohibiting flaring and subsurface water disposal , more stringent environmental impact studies and reviews and policies inhibiting or curtailing lng exports . similar regulatory shifts , including attendant higher costs and market access constraints , may also occur in international jurisdictions in which we operate . hydraulic fracturing , an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations , has historically attracted political and regulatory scrutiny . a range of local , state , federal and national laws and regulations currently govern , constrain or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions . new or more stringent permitting , disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations , including subsurface water disposal , could result in increased costs , operating restrictions or operational delays or could limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources . in addition , certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives , contested lease sales and challenged project permits , for example , to restrict oil and natural gas development generally as well as specific projects , including the # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end willow project in alaska . in the event that ballot initiatives , local , state , or national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations , we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration , development or production activities . such compliance costs and delays , curtailments , limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business , prospects , results of operations , financial condition , liquidity and ability to implement and advance the plan . political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us . approximately [XX] percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the u.s . in [XXXX] , and [XX] percent of our proved reserves , as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , were located outside the u.s . we are subject to risks associated with our operations in foreign jurisdictions and international markets , including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil , bitumen , lng , natural gas or ngl pricing and taxation ; other regulatory or economic developments ( including the macro effects of international trade policies and disputes ) ; disruptive geopolitical conditions , and international monetary and currency rate fluctuations . for example , in december [XXXX] , in response to higher energy prices resulting from the conflict between russia and ukraine , australia ’s parliament passed legislation setting a one - year price cap on natural gas . further legislation was introduced in [XXXX] that extends the price cap through to at least june [XXXX] , subject to further review and certain exemptions . restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy security and climate policies . the escalation of geopolitical tension in the middle east in late [XXXX] and early [XXXX] underscores the continued relevance of this consideration . in addition , some countries where we operate lack a fully independent judiciary system . this , coupled with changes in foreign law or policy , results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations to increased risks , including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities , such as expropriations . actions by host governments , such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the venezuelan government , have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future . in addition , the u.s . government has the authority to prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign jurisdictions or with certain parties . these restrictions and similar restrictions imposed by foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in , or gain access to , opportunities in various jurisdictions . diplomatic relations or policies between the u.s . government and one or more foreign jurisdictions may impair our ability to collect awards in legal actions against such foreign jurisdictions . changes in domestic and international policies and regulations may also restrict our ability to obtain or maintain licenses or permits necessary to operate in foreign jurisdictions , including those necessary for drilling and development of wells . similarly , the declaration of a “ climate emergency ” could result in actions to limit exports of our products and other restrictions . any of these actions could adversely affect our business or operating results , including our ability to implement and advance the plan . other risk factors facing our business or operations we may need additional capital in the future , and it may not be available on acceptable terms or at all . we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our business to fund our operations and strategy ; however , we have also relied from time to time on access to the capital markets for funding . there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all . in addition , although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plans , there can be no assurance we will be able to do so . our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plans , will be subject to a number of factors , including market conditions , our operating performance , investor sentiment , risks impacting financial institutions and the credit markets more broadly and financial institution policies regarding the oil and gas industry . if we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason , our business could be adversely affected . in addition , we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agencies based on a number of factors , including our financial strength and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally . we and other industry companies have had our ratings reduced in the past due to negative commodity price outlooks . these major rating agencies are now considering esg attributes when assessing credit profiles . while these assessments have limited impact today , they have the potential to pressure credit ratings over time . any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of , or defaults under our contracts with , third - parties with whom we do business . the operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries , including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry . these counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity , or for other reasons , including bankruptcy . market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties , or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations , may also exacerbate any operational difficulties or liquidity issues they are experiencing . any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligations under agreements we have made with third - parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations . in addition , our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances . we may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty , which could further adversely impact our results of operations . our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations . in december [XXXX] , we initiated a three - tier capital return program that consists of our ordinary dividend , share repurchases and a variable return of cash ( vroc ) . ordinary dividends are authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors , including : • cash available for distribution ; • our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations ; • our financial condition , especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties ; • the level of distributions paid by comparable companies ; • our operating expenses ; and • other factors our board of directors deems relevant . vroc distributions are also authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors , including : • the anticipated level of distributions required to meet our capital returns commitment ; • forward prices ; • the amount of cash we hold ; • total yield ; and • other factors our board of directors deems relevant . we expect to continue to pay a quarterly ordinary dividend to our stockholders . in addition , based on the current environment , we anticipate also paying a quarterly vroc to our shareholders ; however , the amount of dividends and vroc is variable and will depend upon the above factors , and our board of directors may determine not to pay a dividend or vroc in a quarter or may cease declaring a dividend or vroc at any time . since the inception of the three - tier return of capital program , the vroc has both increased and decreased across quarters , and it may continue to fluctuate in the future . additionally , as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , $ [XX.X] billion of repurchase authority remained of the $ [XX] billion share repurchase program our board of directors had authorized . our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period , and our decision to commence , discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our board of directors may consider when declaring dividends , among other factors . in the past we have suspended our share repurchase program in response to market downturns , including as a result of the oil market downturn that began in early [XXXX] , and we may do so again in the future . any downward revision in the amount of our ordinary dividend or vroc or the volume of shares we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start risk factors # # table_end there are substantial risks with any acquisitions or divestitures we have completed or that we may choose to undertake . we regularly review our portfolio and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore assets or businesses . we may not be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms , on a timely basis , or at all . even if we do complete such transactions , our cash flow from operations may be adversely impacted or otherwise the transactions may not result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks , including , but not limited to ( i ) the failure of the acquired assets or businesses to meet or exceed expected returns , including risk of impairment ; ( ii ) the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions ; and ( iii ) the discovery of unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections are inadequate or we lack insurance or indemnities , including environmental liabilities , or with regard to divested assets or businesses , claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification . in addition , we may face difficulties in integrating the operations , technologies , products and personnel of any acquired assets or businesses . our technologies , systems and networks are subject to cybersecurity threats . our business is faced with growing cybersecurity threats as we increasingly rely on digital technologies across our business . cybersecurity risks to our business , including our suppliers , third - party service providers , contractors , joint venture partners and external business partners , include but are not limited to : • unauthorized access to , or control of or disclosure of sensitive information about our business and our employees ; • compromise of our data or systems , including corruption , sabotage , encryption or acts that otherwise render our data or systems unusable ( or those of third - parties with whom we do business , including third - party cloud and information technology ( it ) service providers ) ; • theft or manipulation of our proprietary information ; • ransom ; • extortion ; • threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure ; and • cyber terrorism . in addition , we have exposure to cybersecurity risks where our data and proprietary information are collected , hosted , and/or processed by third - party cloud and service providers . our risks may be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cybersecurity incident or understand the full extent of such incident notwithstanding our risk management processes and controls . we face risks associated with new and ever - increasing phishing techniques , hidden malware , as well as risks associated with electronic data proliferation and technology digitization . we also face increased risk with the increased sophistication of generative artificial intelligence capabilities , which may improve or expand the existing capabilities of cybercriminals described above in a manner we can not predict at this time . our increasing reliance on it in our production , distribution and marketing systems may allow cybersecurity threats to disrupt our oil and gas operations , both domestically and abroad . if our data , it , operational technology ( ot ) , including industrial control and supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) systems were to be breached , damaged or disrupted due to a cybersecurity incident or cyber - attack ( directly , indirectly through third - parties or through the it networks , servers , software , or infrastructure on which they rely ) , we could be subject to serious negative consequences . these consequences could include physical damage to production , distribution or storage assets ; delay or prevention of delivery to markets ; disruption or prevention of accurate accounting for production and settlement of transactions ; negative impacts on public health , safety , the environment , economic security , or national security ; financial impacts ; business interruption ; reputational damage ; loss of employee , supplier , contractor , partner and/or public trust ; reimbursement or other costs ; increased compliance costs ; regulatory investigations ; litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines ; penalties or other external intervention . although we have business continuity plans in place , our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our business . further , our ability to insure against cybersecurity risks may be limited by the availability and increasing expense of sufficient coverage . for additional information regarding our cybersecurity risk management , strategy and governance , see i tem 1c . cyber s ecurity . # # table_start conocophillips [XXXX] [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end"

emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage , hydrogen , lower - emission fuels , and lithium . affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses . exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates , many with names that include exxonmobil , exxon , esso , mobil or xto . for convenience and simplicity , in this report the terms exxonmobil , exxon , esso , mobil , and xto , as well as terms like corporation , company , our , we , and its , are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates . the precise meaning depends on the context in question . in october [XXXX] the corporation entered into a merger agreement with pioneer natural resources company ( pioneer ) , an independent oil and gas exploration and production company , in exchange for exxonmobil common stock . the transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of [XXXX] , subject to regulatory approvals . for additional information , see "" note [XX] : mergers and acquisitions "" in the financial section of this report . the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive , both within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy , fuel , and chemical needs of industrial and individual consumers . certain industry participants , including exxonmobil , are expanding investments in lower - emission energy and emission - reduction services and technologies . the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes . operating data and industry segment information for the corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the following : “ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations : business results ” and “ note [XX] : disclosures about segments and related information ” . information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “ oil and gas reserves ” part of the “ supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities ” portion of the financial section of this report . exxonmobil has a long - standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology . we have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our businesses . exxonmobil held over [X] thousand active patents worldwide at the end of [XXXX] . for technology licensed to third parties , revenues totaled approximately $ [XXX] million in [XXXX] . although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our company , the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent , trade secret , trademark , license , franchise , or concession . exxonmobil operates in a highly complex , competitive , and changing global energy business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length . this long - term orientation underpins the corporation 's philosophy on talent development . talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle . our career - oriented approach to talent development results in strong retention and an average length of service of about [XX] years for our career employees . compensation , benefits , and workplace programs support the corporation 's talent management approach , and are designed to attract and retain employees for a career through compensation that is market competitive , long - term oriented , and highly differentiated by individual performance . over [XX] percent of our global employee workforce is from outside the u.s . , and over the past decade [XX] percent of our global hires for management , professional and technical positions were female and [XX] percent of our u.s . hires for management , professional and technical positions were minorities . with over [XXX] nationalities represented in the company , we encourage and respect diversity of thought , ideas , and perspective from our workforce . we consider and monitor diversity through all stages of employment , including recruitment , training , and development of our employees . we also work closely with the communities where we operate to identify and invest in initiatives that help support local needs , including local talent and skill development . the number of regular employees was [XX] thousand , [XX] thousand , and [XX] thousand at years ended [XXXX] , [XXXX] , and [XXXX] , respectively . regular employees are defined as active executive , management , professional , technical , administrative , and wage employees who work full time or part time for the corporation and are covered by the corporation ’s benefit plans and programs . as discussed in "" item 1a . risk factors "" in this report , compliance with existing and potential future government regulations , including taxes , environmental regulations , and other government regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the production and sale of our products , may have material effects on the capital expenditures , earnings , and competitive position of exxonmobil . for additional information on the corporation 's worldwide environmental expenditures , see "" management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations : environmental matters "" in the financial section of this report . information concerning the source and availability of raw materials used in the corporation ’s business , the extent of seasonality in the business , the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of governments , and risks attendant to foreign operations may be found in “ item 1a . risk factors ” and “ item [X] . properties ” in this report . exxonmobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com . our annual report on form [XX] -

emission business opportunities . many of these risk factors are not within the company ’s control and could adversely affect our business , our financial and operating results , or our financial condition . these risk factors include : supply and demand the oil , gas , and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses . this means exxonmobil ’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil , gas , and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products . oil , gas , petrochemical , and product prices and margins in turn depend on local , regional , and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product . any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company ’s operations , financial condition , and proved reserves , especially in the upstream segment . on the other hand , a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company ’s operations , especially in the energy products , chemical products , and specialty products segments . our pursuit of lower - emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage , hydrogen , lower - emission fuels , and lithium also depends on the growth and development of markets for those products and services , including implementation of supportive government policies and developments in technology to enable those products and services to be provided on a cost - effective basis at commercial scale . see "" climate change and the energy transition "" in this item 1a . economic conditions . the demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad - based economic activities and levels of prosperity . the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results . other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region , such as changes in population growth rates , periods of civil unrest , government regulation or austerity programs , trade tariffs or broader breakdowns in global trade , security or public health issues and responses , or currency exchange rate fluctuations , can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals . sovereign debt downgrades , defaults , inability to access debt markets due to rating , banking , or legal constraints , liquidity crises , the breakup or restructuring of fiscal , monetary , or political systems such as the european union , and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil , including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil . our future business results , including cash flows and financing needs , may also be affected by the occurrence , severity , pace and rate of recovery of future public health epidemics or pandemics ; the responsive actions taken by governments and others ; and the resulting effects on regional and global markets and economies . other demand - related factors . other factors that may affect the demand for oil , gas , petrochemicals or our other products , and therefore impact our results , include technological improvements in energy efficiency ; seasonal weather patterns ; increased competitiveness of , or government policy support for , alternative energy sources ; changes in technology that alter fuel choices , such as technological advances in energy storage or other critical areas that make wind , solar , hydrogen , nuclear or other alternatives more competitive for power generation ; changes in consumer preferences for our products , including consumer demand for alternative - fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products ; and broad - based changes in personal income levels . see also “ climate change and the energy transition ” below . other supply - related factors . commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply . for example , increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand . similarly , increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products . world oil , gas , and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies , such as the level of and adherence by participating countries to production quotas established by opec or "" opec+ "" and other agreements among sovereigns ; government policies , including actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs ; the occurrence of wars or hostile actions , including disruption of land or sea transportation routes ; natural disasters ; disruptions in competitors ’ operations ; and logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies . technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find , produce and refine oil and gas , and to manufacture petrochemicals . other market factors . exxonmobil ’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates , inflation , currency exchange rates , changes in usage of the u.s . dollar in global trade , and other local or regional market conditions . in addition to direct potential impacts on our costs and revenues , market factors such as rates of inflation may indirectly impact our results to the extent such factors reduce general rates of economic growth and therefore energy demand , as discussed under “ economic conditions ” . market factors may also result in losses from commodity derivatives and other instruments we use to hedge price exposures or for trading purposes . additional information regarding the potential future impact of market factors on our businesses is included or incorporated by reference under "" item 7a . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk "" in this report . government and political factors exxonmobil ’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations . access limitations . a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources , including by restricting leasing or permitting activities , or may place resources off - limits from development altogether . restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies . restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices or when national governments may have less need for outside sources of private capital . many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin . restrictions on doing business . exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted , including acquiring or divesting certain assets . such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions . lack of legal certainty . some countries in which we do business lack well - developed legal systems , have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks , or may have evolving and unharmonized standards that vary or conflict across jurisdictions . lack of legal certainty exposes us to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials , and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts . in some cases , these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum , but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award . regulatory and litigation risks . even in countries with well - developed legal systems where exxonmobil does business , we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law ( including changes that result from international treaties and accords ) and changes in policy that could adversely affect our results , such as : • increases in taxes , duties , or government royalty rates ( including retroactive claims or punitive taxes on oil , gas and petrochemical operations ) ; • price controls ; • changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of operation or compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities ( including changes in laws affecting offshore drilling operations , standards to complete decommissioning , water use , emissions , hydraulic fracturing , or production or use of new or recycled plastics , as well as laws and regulations affecting trading ) ; • actions by policy - makers , regulators , or other actors to delay or deny necessary licenses and permits , restrict the availability of oil and gas leases or the transportation or export of our products , or otherwise require changes in the company 's business or strategy that could result in reduced returns ; • regulatory interpretations that exclude or disfavor our products under government policies or programs intended to support new or developing markets or technologies , or that otherwise are not technology - neutral ; • adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards , the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components ; • adoption of disclosure regulations that could create competitive disadvantages , require us to incur disproportionate costs , or increase legal risk due to a need to rely on uncertain estimates or extrapolations ( such as emissions of third parties ) and lack of uniform standards across jurisdictions , or by requiring us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or to violate the non - disclosure laws of other countries ; and • government actions to cancel contracts , redenominate the official currency , renounce or default on obligations , renegotiate terms unilaterally , or expropriate assets . legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate . we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation , especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur ; by government enforcement proceedings alleging non - compliance with applicable laws or regulations ; or by state and local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas ( including seeking to reduce the production and sale of hydrocarbon products through litigation targeting the company or other industry participants ) , gain political notoriety , or obtain monetary awards from the company . the continued adoption of similar legal practices in the european union or elsewhere would broaden this risk and has begun to be applied to some of our competitors in the european union . security concerns . successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest , acts of sabotage or terrorism , cybersecurity attacks , the application of national security laws or policies that result in restricting our ability to do business in a particular jurisdiction , and other local security concerns . such concerns may be directed specifically at our company , our industry , or as part of broader movements and may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time . climate change and the energy transition net - zero scenarios . driven by concern over the risks of climate change , a number of countries have adopted , or are considering the adoption of , regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from the production and use of oil and gas and their products as well as the use or support for different emission - reduction technologies . these actions are being taken both independently by national and regional governments and within the framework of united nations conference of the parties summits under which many countries of the world have endorsed objectives to reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) over the coming decades , with an ambition ultimately to achieve “ net zero ” . net zero means that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such gases from the atmosphere . expectations for transition of the world ’s energy system to lower - emission sources , and ultimately net - zero , derive from hypothetical scenarios that reflect many assumptions about the future and reflect substantial uncertainties . the company ’s objective to play a leading role in the energy transition , including the company ’s announced ambition ultimately to achieve net zero with respect to scope [X] and [X] emissions from operations with continued technology development and policy support where exxonmobil is the operator , carries risks that the transition , including underlying technologies , policies , and markets as discussed in more detail below , will not be available or develop at the pace or in the manner expected by current net - zero scenarios . the success of our strategy for the energy transition will also depend on our ability to recognize key signposts of changes in the global energy system on a timely basis , and our corresponding ability to direct investment to the technologies and businesses , at the appropriate stage of development , to best capitalize on our competitive strengths . greenhouse gas restrictions . government actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include adoption of cap and trade regimes , carbon taxes , carbon - based import duties or other trade tariffs , minimum renewable usage requirements , restrictive permitting , increased mileage and other efficiency standards , mandates for sales of electric vehicles , mandates for use of specific fuels or technologies , and other incentives or mandates designed to support certain technologies for transitioning to lower - emission energy sources . political and other actors and their agents also increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly , such as by seeking to reduce the availability or increase the cost of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector . these actions include delaying or blocking needed infrastructure , utilizing shareholder governance mechanisms against companies or their shareholders or financial institutions in an effort to deter investment in oil and gas activities , and taking other actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and gas companies . depending on how policies are formulated and applied , such policies could negatively affect our investment returns , make our hydrocarbon - based products more expensive or less competitive , lengthen project implementation times , and reduce demand for hydrocarbons , as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower - carbon alternatives . current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs , such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions . technology and lower - emission solutions . achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately achieve net zero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources , as well as technologies such as carbon capture and storage ( ccs ) . ccs technologies , focused initially on capturing and sequestering co2 emissions from high - intensity industrial activities , can assist in meeting society ’s objective to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas levels while also helping ensure the availability of the reliable and affordable energy the world requires . exxonmobil has established a low carbon solutions ( lcs ) business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and projects , including ccs , hydrogen , lower - emission fuels , and lithium , breakthrough energy efficiency processes , advanced energy - saving materials , and other technologies . the company ’s efforts include both in - house research and development as well as collaborative efforts with leading universities and with commercial partners involved in advanced lower - emission energy technologies . our future results and ability to grow our lcs business , help nations meet their emission - reduction goals , and succeed through the energy transition will depend in part on the success of these research and collaboration efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost - competitive manner . policy and market development . the scale of the world ’s energy system means that , in addition to developments in technology as discussed above , a successful energy transition will require appropriate support from governments and private participants throughout the global economy . our ability to develop and deploy ccs and other lower - emission energy technologies at commercial scale , and the growth and future returns of lcs and other emerging businesses in which we invest , will depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets . failure or delay of these policies or markets to materialize or be maintained could adversely impact these investments . policy and other actions that result in restricting the availability of hydrocarbon products without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects , including increased commodity price volatility ; periods of significantly higher commodity prices and resulting inflationary pressures ; and local or regional energy shortages . such effects in turn may depress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in policy by different actors , with resulting adverse effects on our businesses . in addition , the existence of supportive policies in any jurisdiction is not a guarantee that those policies will continue in the future . see also the discussion of “ supply and demand , ” “ government and political factors , ” and “ operational and other factors ” in this item 1a . operational and other factors in addition to external economic and political factors , our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are , at least in part , within our control , including our capital allocation into existing and new businesses . the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition . for projects in which we are not the operator , we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co - venturers whom we do not control . exploration and development program . our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts . among other factors , we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources online as scheduled and within budget . project and portfolio management . the long - term success of exxonmobil ’s upstream and product solutions businesses , as well as the future success of lcs and other emerging lower - emission investments , depends on complex , long - term , capital - intensive projects . these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency . specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to : negotiate successfully with joint venturers , partners , governments , suppliers , customers , or others ; model and optimize reservoir performance ; develop markets for project outputs , whether through long - term contracts or the development of effective spot markets ; qualify for certain incentives available under supportive government policies for emerging markets and technologies ; manage changes in operating conditions and costs , including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping , supply - chain disruptions , and inflationary cost pressures ; prevent , to the extent possible , and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project start - up or cause unscheduled project downtime ; and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role . in addition to the effective management of individual projects , exxonmobil ’s success , including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders , depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio , including diversification among types and locations of our projects , products produced , and strategies to acquire or divest assets . we may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies . additionally , we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated . the term “ project ” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports . operational efficiency . an important component of exxonmobil ’s competitive performance , especially given the commodity - based nature of many of our businesses , is our ability to operate efficiently , including our ability to manage expenses , improve production yields on an ongoing basis and successfully integrate and achieve the anticipated synergies of acquisitions , including the acquisition of pioneer natural resources company . this requires continuous management focus , including technology integration and improvements , cost control , productivity enhancements , harmonizing the functions , policies , procedures and processes , regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio , and the recruitment , development , and retention of high caliber employees . research and development and technological change . to maintain our competitive position , especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement , exxonmobil ’s technology , research , and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment , including continuous improvement in the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing technology and developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions . to remain competitive , we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies , including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to our businesses . safety , business controls , and environmental risk management . our results depend on management ’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil , gas , and petrochemical operations , to effectively control our business activities , including trading , and to minimize the potential for human error . we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events . for example , we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management , ongoing upgrades , key equipment replacements , and comprehensive inspection and surveillance . similarly , we are implementing cost - effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce emissions , not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities . we employ a robust and actively evolving enterprise risk management system to identify and manage risk across our businesses . we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework . substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if we do not timely identify and mitigate applicable risks , or if our management systems and controls do not function as intended . cybersecurity . exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of sources including state - sponsored actors . see item 1c in this report for information on exxonmobil ’s program for managing cybersecurity risks . if the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected , exxonmobil , as well as our customers , employees , or third parties , could be adversely affected . we have limited ability to influence third parties , including our partners , suppliers and service providers ( including providers of cloud - hosting services for our data or applications ) , to implement strong cybersecurity controls and are exposed to potential harm from cybersecurity events that may affect their operations . cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment ; damage or destroy assets ; compromise business systems ; result in proprietary information being altered , lost , or stolen ; result in employee , customer , or third - party information being compromised ; or otherwise disrupt our business operations . we could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions , litigation , or reputational harm . preparedness . our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events , natural disasters , human error , and similar events . for example , hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas . our facilities are designed , engineered , constructed , and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions , with safety factors built in to cover a number of uncertainties , including those associated with wave , wind , and current intensity , marine ice flow patterns , permafrost stability , storm surge magnitude , temperature extremes , extreme rainfall events , and earthquakes . our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce . our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering , our rigorous disaster preparedness and response , and business continuity planning . insurance limitations . the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the availability and cost of coverage , which may not be economic , as well as the capacity of the applicable insurance markets , which may not be sufficient . competition . as noted in item [X] above , the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive . we face competition not only from other private firms , but also from state - owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as partners with other private firms . in some cases , these state - owned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners , with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders , such as exxonmobil . technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resource - owning countries to partner with private - sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources . as described in more detail above , our hydrocarbon - based energy products are also subject to growing and , in many cases , government - supported competition from alternative energy sources . reputation . our reputation is an important corporate asset . factors that could have a negative impact on our reputation include an operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption ; changes in consumer views concerning our products ; a perception by investors or others that the corporation is making insufficient progress with respect to our ambition to play a leading role in the energy transition , or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investments with reduced returns ; and other adverse events such as those described in this item 1a . negative impacts on our reputation could in turn make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities , obtain necessary regulatory approvals , obtain financing , and attract talent , or they could reduce consumer demand for our branded products . exxonmobil ’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole . projections , estimates , and descriptions of exxonmobil ’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items [X] , 1a , 1c , [X] , [X] , [X] , and 7a of this report are forward - looking statements . actual future results , including project completion dates , production rates , capital expenditures , costs , and business plans could differ materially due to , among other things , the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report . # # table_start"

end reserves .","item 1a . risk factors as a global energy company , chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company ’s results of operations and financial condition . business and operational risk factors chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility . the most significant factor that affects the company ’s results of operations is the price of crude oil , which can be influenced by general economic conditions and level of economic growth , including low or negative growth ; industry production and inventory levels ; technology advancements , including those in pursuit of a lower carbon economy ; production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries or other producers ; weather - related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control ; competing fuel prices ; geopolitical risks ; the pace of energy transition ; customer and consumer preferences and the use of # # table_start # # table_end substitutes ; and governmental regulations , policies and other actions regarding the development of oil and gas reserves , as well as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change . chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process . an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices . extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company ’s results of operations , financial condition and liquidity . among other things , the company ’s upstream earnings , cash flows , and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected , as could its production and proved reserves . upstream assets may also become impaired . downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales . a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company ’s credit ratings , potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets . the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings , expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns , and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business , including our chevron new energies organization . in some cases , transferred liabilities , including for abandonment and decommissioning of divested oil and gas assets , have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy . in addition , extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations , financial condition and liquidity of the company ’s suppliers , vendors , partners and equity affiliates upon which the company ’s own results of operations and financial condition depend . the scope of chevron ’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business ; therefore , if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions , exploration or technology , the company ’s business will decline . creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors , including obtaining and renewing rights to explore , develop and produce hydrocarbons ; drilling success ; reservoir optimization ; technology advancements ; ability to bring long - lead - time , capital - intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule ; partner alignment , including strategic support ; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties . the company ’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions . the company ’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control , including risks from hurricanes , severe storms , floods , heat waves , other forms of severe weather , wildfires , ambient temperature increases , sea level rise , war or other military conflicts such as the war between israel and hamas and the military conflict between russia and ukraine , accidents , civil unrest , political events , fires , earthquakes , system failures , cyber threats , terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases , some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment . chevron ’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency . while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency , sea level rise , air and water temperature , precipitation , fresh water access , wind speed , and earthquake severity , among other factors , it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing , frequency or severity of such events , any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 's results of operations or financial condition . cyberattacks targeting chevron ’s operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company ’s business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to chevron ’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors , including criminal hackers , state - sponsored intrusions , industrial espionage and employee malfeasance . these cyber threat actors , whether internal or external to chevron , are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company ’s information technology ( it ) systems and data , including the it systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through , without limitation , malicious software ; data privacy breaches by employees , insiders or others with authorized access ; cyber or phishing - attacks ; ransomware ; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems ; and other electronic security breaches . the cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors , including during political tensions , war or other military conflicts , or civil unrest . although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data , whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties , the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business . cyber threat actors could compromise the company ’s operational technology networks or other # # table_start # # table_end critical systems and infrastructure , resulting in disruptions to its business operations , injury to people , harm to the environment or its assets , disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems , or loss , misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information , including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees , customers , partners and other third parties . any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident . further , the company is increasingly experiencing cyber incidents related to its third - party vendors . some third - party vendors house the company ’s critical data and proprietary information on their it systems , including the cloud ; others have access to chevron ’s it systems or provide software through which threat actors could gain access or introduce malware to chevron ’s it systems . regardless of the precise method or form , cyber events could result in significant financial losses , legal or regulatory violations , reputational harm , and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company ’s business and results of operations . the company ’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevron ’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the energy industry . the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner . however , failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents , including releases , explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury , loss of life , environmental damage , loss of revenues , legal liability and/or disruption to operations . chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies , standards , processes and systems , behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety , health , environmental , reliability and efficiency risks ; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies ; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents . in certain situations where chevron is not the operator , the company may have limited influence and control over third parties , which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks . the company does not insure against all potential losses , which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or third - party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss . as a result , the company is , to a substantial extent , self - insured for such events . the company relies on existing liquidity , financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short - term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events . the occurrence of a significant incident , series of events , or unforeseen liability for which the company is self - insured , not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company ’s results of operations or financial condition . chevron may not complete the acquisition of hess corporation within the time frame the company anticipates or at all , which could have adverse effects on chevron the completion of the acquisition of hess corporation ( hess ) is subject to a number of conditions , including regulatory approvals and approval by hess stockholders of the adoption of the merger agreement . additionally , hess and chevron have been engaged in discussions with exxon mobil corporation and china national offshore oil corporation regarding a right of first refusal provision in the joint operating agreement for the stabroek block offshore guyana . if these discussions do not result in an acceptable resolution and arbitration ( if pursued ) does not result in a confirmation that such right of first refusal provision is inapplicable to the merger , then there would be a failure of a closing condition under the merger agreement , in which case the merger would not close . for additional information , please see the section entitled “ the merger — stabroek joa ” in chevron ’s preliminary registration statement on form s-4 to be filed on february [XX] , [XXXX] . further , on december [X] , [XXXX] , chevron and hess each received a request for additional information and documentary materials ( second request ) from the federal trade commission ( ftc ) in connection with the ftc ’s review of the merger . issuance of the second request extends the waiting period imposed by the hart - scott - rodino antitrust improvements act of [XXXX] , as amended , until [XX] days after chevron and hess have substantially complied with the second request , unless that period is extended voluntarily by chevron and hess or terminated sooner by the ftc . the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all . in addition , the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the acquisition that are granted , if any , may impose requirements , limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the company ’s business after the transaction or materially delay the completion of the acquisition . a delay in completing the acquisition could cause the company to realize some or all of the benefits later than we otherwise expect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated timeframe , which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the acquisition . # # table_start # # table_end acquisitions may cause chevron ’s financial results to differ from the company ’s expectations or the expectations of the investment community , the company may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition , and the acquisition may disrupt the company ’s current plans or operations the success of prior acquisitions , such as pdc energy , inc . ( pdc ) , and the pending acquisition of hess will depend , in part , on chevron ’s ability to successfully integrate each of the businesses of pdc and hess and realize the anticipated benefits , including synergies . difficulties in integrating pdc and hess may result in the failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframes , in operational challenges , and in the diversion of management ’s attention from ongoing business concerns , as well as in unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisitions , which may have an adverse impact on the company ’s financial results . legal , regulatory and esg - related risk factors chevron ’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces , transports , refines and markets potentially hazardous materials , and it purchases , handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business . chevron ’s operations also produce byproducts , which may be considered pollutants . often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control . any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action . for example , liability or delays could result from an accidental , unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company ’s operations on human health or the environment . in addition , to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved , it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company ’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage , or to other mitigating factors . for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved , see note [XX] litigation . political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm chevron ’s business the company ’s operations , particularly exploration and production , can be affected by changing political , regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates . as has occurred in the past , actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company ’s partially or wholly owned businesses , to force contract renegotiations , or to impose additional taxes or royalties . in certain locations , governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company ’s operations , trade , currency exchange controls , burdensome taxes , and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company ’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties . in other countries , political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company ’s continued presence in those countries , and internal unrest , acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company ’s operations . those developments have , at times , significantly affected the company ’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries . further , chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the united states and other jurisdictions where we operate , such as sanctions imposed in venezuela and russia , which , depending upon their scope , could adversely impact the company ’s operations and financial results in these countries . in addition , litigation or changes in national , state or local environmental regulations or laws , including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas , such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling , or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products , could adversely affect the company ’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability . legislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose chevron to additional tax liabilities changes in tax laws and regulations around the world are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the company ’s control . chevron ’s taxes in the jurisdictions where the company conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations , including but not limited to , substantive changes in , reductions in , or the repeal or expiration of tax incentives , such as u.s . federal tax incentives for biodiesel blending , which expire in [XXXX] . furthermore , chevron ’s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world . there is no assurance that taxing authorities or courts will agree with the positions that chevron has reflected on the company ’s tax returns , in which case interest and penalties could be imposed that may have a material adverse effect on the company ’s results of operations or financial condition . during periods of high profitability for certain companies or industries , there are often calls for increased taxes on profits , often called “ windfall profit ” taxes . governments in various jurisdictions , including california and australia , have announced , proposed , or implemented windfall profit taxes for companies operating in the energy and oil and gas sectors . such taxes may be imposed on us or may be increased in the future in these or other jurisdictions . the imposition of , or # # table_start # # table_end increase in , such windfall profit taxes could adversely affect the company ’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability . for information concerning the company ’s tax liabilities , see note [XX] taxes and note [XX] other contingencies and commitments . legislation , regulation , and other government actions and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions and climate change could continue to increase chevron ’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron ’s hydrocarbon and other products , resulting in a material adverse effect on the company ’s results of operations and financial condition chevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of international and domestic legislation , regulation , or other government actions relating to ghg emissions ( e.g. , carbon dioxide and methane ) and climate change . international agreements and national , regional , and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce ghg emissions are in various stages of implementation . legislation , regulation , and other government actions related to ghg emissions and climate change could reduce demand for chevron ’s hydrocarbon and other products and/or continue to increase chevron ’s operational costs and reduce its return on investment . the paris agreement went into effect in november [XXXX] , and a number of countries in which we operate have adopted and may adopt additional policies intended to meet their paris agreement goals . globally , multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate ghg emissions through a carbon tax , a cap - and - trade program , performance standards or other mechanisms , or to attempt to indirectly advance reduction of ghg emissions through restrictive permitting , procurement standards , trade barriers , minimum renewable usage requirements , financing standards , standards or requirements for environmental benefit claims , increased ghg reporting and climate - related disclosure requirements , or tax advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy , fuel sources or lower - carbon technologies . for example , the company is currently subject to implemented programs in certain jurisdictions , such as the renewable fuel standard program in the u.s . , california ’s cap - and - trade program and low carbon fuel standard , and newly approved mandates such as the california air resources board advanced clean cars ii regulations , as well as other indirect regulation of ghg emissions , which may , among other things , ban or restrict technologies or products that use the company ’s products . ghg emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include , among others , those associated with the company ’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons ; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil ; power generation ; the conversion of crude oil , natural gas and biofeedstocks into refined hydrocarbon products ; the processing , liquefaction , and regasification of natural gas ; the transportation of crude oil , natural gas , and other products ; and customers ’ and consumers ’ use of the company ’s hydrocarbon products . in addition , the u.s . inflation reduction act ( ira ) implements various incentives for lower carbon activities , including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel . although the ira offers incentives that could support certain lower carbon lines of business , those same incentives could negatively impact supply and/or demand for our oil and gas products in the future or any existing or future lower carbon business lines . many of these actions , as well as customers ’ and consumers ’ preferences and use of the company ’s products or substitute products , and actions taken by the company ’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations , are beyond the company ’s control . similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment , climate change - related legislation , regulation , or other government actions may curtail profitability in oil and gas and lower carbon businesses , as well as render the extraction of the company ’s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible . in particular , ghg emissions - related legislation , regulations , and other government actions , and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing ghg emissions may result in increased and substantial capital , compliance , operating , and maintenance costs and could , among other things , reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company ’s hydrocarbon - based products ; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources ; make the company ’s products more expensive ; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company ’s resources ; impact or limit our business plans ; and adversely affect the company ’s sales volumes , revenues , margins and reputation . for example , some jurisdictions are in various stages of design , adoption , and implementation of policies and programs that cap emissions and/or require short- , medium- , and long - term ghg reductions by operators at the asset or facility level , which may not be technologically feasible , or which could require significant capital expenditure , increase costs of or limit production , result in impairment of assets and limit chevron ’s ability to cost - effectively reduce ghg emissions across its global portfolio . the ultimate effect of international agreements ; national , regional , and state legislation and regulation ; and government and private actions related to ghg emissions and climate change on the company ’s financial performance , and the timing of # # table_start # # table_end these effects , will depend on a number of factors . such factors include , among others , the sectors covered , the ghg emissions reductions required , standardized carbon accounting , the extent to which chevron would be able to receive , generate , or purchase credits , the price and availability of credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover , or continue to recover , the costs incurred through the pricing of the company ’s products in the competitive marketplace . further , the ultimate impact of ghg emissions and climate change - related agreements , legislation , regulation , and government actions on the company ’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty , for a multitude of individual jurisdictions , the outcome of political decision - making processes , including the actual laws and regulations enacted , the variables and trade - offs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes , and market conditions , including the responses of consumers to such changes . increasing attention to environmental , social , and governance ( esg ) matters impacts our company increasing attention to esg matters , including those related to climate change and sustainability , increasing societal , investor and legislative pressure on companies to address esg matters , and potential customer and consumer use of substitutes to chevron ’s products have resulted and may continue to result in changes to the portfolio and company activities , increased costs , reduced demand for our products , reduced profits , increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof , negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets , impaired participation in public discourse and debate by the company relating to mandatory and voluntary standards and regulations , and damage to our reputation . for example , increasing attention to esg matters , including climate change , may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional litigation and governmental investigations , or threats thereof , against the company . for instance , we have received investigative requests and demands from the u.s . congress for information relating to climate change , methane leak detection and repair , and other topics , and further requests and/or demands are possible . at this time , chevron can not predict the ultimate impact any congressional or other investigations may have on the company . information related to climate - change related litigation matters is included in note [XX] litigation under the heading “ climate change . ” some stakeholders , including but not limited to sovereign wealth , pension , and endowment funds , have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves . further , voluntary carbon - related and target - setting frameworks have developed , and continue to develop , that limit the ability of certain sectors , including the oil and gas sector , from participating , and may result in exclusion of the company ’s equity from being included as an investment option in portfolios . in addition , some stakeholders , including some of our investors , have divergent and evolving views on our esg - related strategies and priorities , vis - à - vis our lines of business , calling for focus on increased production of oil and gas products rather than new business lines and climate - related targets . these circumstances , among others , may result in pressure from activists on production ; unfavorable reputational impacts , including inaccurate perceptions or a misrepresentation of our actual esg policies , practices and performance ; diversion of management ’s attention and resources ; and proxy fights , among other material adverse impacts on our businesses . in addition , organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters , including climate change and climate - related risks ( including entities commonly referred to as “ raters and rankers ” ) . such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions . unfavorable esg ratings and investment community divestment initiatives , among other actions , may lead to negative investor sentiment toward chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries , which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital . additionally , evolving expectations on various esg matters , including biodiversity , waste and water , have increased , and may continue to increase , costs , require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment . our aspirations , targets and disclosures related to esg matters subject us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our reputation and stock price or result in other material adverse impacts to the company chevron has announced an aspiration to achieve net zero scope [X] and [X] emissions in upstream by [XXXX] . the company also has set nearer - term ghg emission - related targets for zero routine flaring , upstream carbon intensity , and portfolio carbon intensity . these and other aspirations , targets or objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations , and chevron may change them for various reasons , including evolving market conditions ; changes in our portfolio ; and financial , operational , regulatory , reputational , legal and other factors . our ability to achieve any aspiration , target or objective , including with respect to climate - related initiatives , our lower carbon strategy outlined in the management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , pages [XX] through [XX] , and any lower carbon new energy businesses , is subject to numerous risks , many of which are outside of our control . examples of such risks include : ( [X] ) sufficient and substantial advances in technology , including the # # table_start # # table_end continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non - carbon - based energy sources ; ( [X] ) the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities ; ( [X] ) the availability and acceptability of cost - effective , verifiable carbon credits ; ( [X] ) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards ; ( [X] ) evolving regulatory requirements , including changes to ipcc ’s global warming potentials , affecting esg standards or disclosures ; ( [X] ) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals ; ( [X] ) customers ’ and consumers ’ preferences and use of the company ’s products or substitute products ; and ( 8) actions taken by the company ’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations . the standards and regulations for tracking , reporting , marketing and advertising related to esg matters are relatively new , have not been harmonized and continue to evolve . our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period . our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for identifying , measuring , and reporting esg metrics , our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others , and such standards may change over time , including through non - public processes , any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals . in addition , chevron participates , along with other companies , institutes , universities , trade associations and other organizations , in various initiatives , campaigns , and other projects that express various ambitions , aspirations and goals related to climate change , emissions and energy transition . chevron ’s individual ambitions , future performance or policies may differ from the ambitions of such organizations or the individual ambitions of other participants in these various initiatives , campaigns , and other projects , and chevron may unilaterally change its individual ambitions , aspirations and goals . achievement of or efforts to achieve aspirations , targets , goals and objectives such as the foregoing and future internal climate - related initiatives has , and may continue to , increase costs , and , in addition , may require purchase of carbon credits , or limit or impact the company ’s business plans , operations and financial results , potentially resulting in the reduction to the economic end - of - life of certain assets , impairing the associated net book value , among other material adverse impacts . our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such aspirations , targets , goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce , or at all , could have a negative impact on the company ’s reputation , investor sentiment , ratings outcomes for evaluating the company ’s approach to esg matters , stock price , and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation , among other material adverse impacts . general risk factors changes in management ’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company ’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period in preparing the company ’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of [XXXX] , including its financial statements , chevron ’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date . these estimates and assumptions are based on management ’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty . materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known . areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property , plant and equipment and investments in affiliates ; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves ; accruals for estimated liabilities , including litigation reserves ; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans . changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions , such as changes in the company ’s business plans , general market conditions , the pace of energy transition , or changes in the company ’s outlook on commodity prices , could affect reported amounts of assets , liabilities or expenses ."

identification . talent development and retention we seek to help our people achieve their full potential by investing in them and supporting a culture of continuous development . our goals are to maximize individual capabilities , increase commercial effectiveness and innovation , reinforce our culture , expand professional opportunities , and help our people contribute positively to their communities . instilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process , in which training plays an important part . we offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars facilitated by our learning & engagement team . to accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture , new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working via orientation programs that emphasize culture and networking , and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year . for our more senior employees , we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively , exhibit strong leadership and exemplify our culture . we are also focused on developing a high performing , diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders . we maintain a variety of programs aimed at employees ’ professional growth and leadership development , including initiatives , such as our vice president and managing director leadership acceleration initiatives and partner development initiative . enhancing our people ’s experience of internal mobility is a key focus , as we believe that this will inspire employees , help retain top talent and create diverse experiences to build future leaders . another important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process . employees are reviewed by supervisors , co - workers and employees whom they supervise in a [XXX] - degree review process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee ’s performance with respect to risk management , protecting our reputation , adherence to our code of conduct , compliance , and diversity and inclusion principles . our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust , timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development . we have directed our managers , as leaders at the firm , to take an active coaching role with their teams . we have also implemented “ the three conversations at gs ” through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year , check in mid - year on progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction . we also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and support community organizations through completing local service projects strengthens our people ’s bond with us . community teamworks , our signature volunteering initiative , enables our people to participate in high -

standing commitment to sustainability . our two priorities in this area are helping clients across industries decarbonize their businesses to support their transition to a low - carbon economy ( climate transition ) and to advance solutions that expand access , increase affordability , and drive outcomes to support sustainable economic growth ( inclusive growth ) . our strategy is to advance these two priorities through our work with our clients , and with strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own , as well as through our supply chain . we established a sustainable finance group ( sfg ) , which serves as the centralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts across our firm , including commercial efforts alongside our businesses , to advance climate transition and inclusive growth . since establishing sfg , our sustainable finance - related efforts have continued to evolve . for example , within global banking & markets , we established the sustainable banking group , a group focused on supporting our corporate clients in reducing their direct and indirect carbon emissions . within asset & wealth management there are multiple teams that specialize in sustainable investing . the sustainability & impact solutions team in asset & wealth management also helps mobilize the full range of insights , advisory services and investment solutions across our asset management client segments . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [X] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our activities relating to sustainability present both financial and nonfinancial risks , and we have processes for managing these risks , similar to the other risks we face . we have integrated oversight of climate - related risks into our risk management governance structure , from senior management to our board and its committees , including the risk and public responsibilities committees . the risk committee of the board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks , which include climate risk , and , as part of its oversight , receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk . the public responsibilities committee of the board assists the board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us , including with respect to climate change . as part of its oversight , the public responsibilities committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy , and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change - related matters . we have also implemented an environmental policy framework to guide our overall approach to sustainability issues . we apply this framework when evaluating transactions for environmental and social risks and impacts . our employees also receive training with respect to environmental and social risks , including for sectors and industries that we believe have higher potential for these risks . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk management — other risk management — climate - related and environmental risk management ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about our climate - related and environmental risk management . as a leading financial institution , we acknowledge the importance of climate transition and inclusive growth for our business . we have completed sustainability bond issuances , which align with our sustainable finance framework for future issuances and fund a range of on - balance sheet sustainable finance activity . we believe we can advance sustainability by partnering with our clients across our businesses , including by developing new sustainability - linked financing solutions , offering strategic advice , or co - investing alongside our clients in clean energy companies . we have announced a target to deploy $ [XXX] billion in sustainable financing , investing and advisory activity by the beginning of [XXXX] . as of december [XXXX] , we achieved approximately [XX] % of that goal , with the majority dedicated to climate transition . with respect to climate transition , we have announced our commitment to align our financing activities with a net - zero - by-2050 pathway . in that context , we have set an initial set of [XXXX] targets for our energy , power and auto manufacturing portfolios , three sectors where we see an opportunity to proactively engage our clients and investors , deploy capital required for transition , and invest in new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy . carbon neutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm and our supply chain . in [XXXX] , we achieved carbon neutrality in our operations and business travel , ahead of our [XXXX] goal announced in [XXXX] . we have expanded our operational carbon commitment to include our supply chain , targeting net - zero carbon emissions by [XXXX] . in addition to climate transition , our approach to sustainability also centers on inclusive growth where we seek to help drive solutions that expand access , increase affordability , and support outcomes to advance sustainable economic growth . commercial solutions that seek to support inclusive growth include , among others , those of our urban investment group and our sustainable investing group . we also seek to support inclusive growth through sponsored initiatives , such as one million black women , [XX,XXX] women and [XX,XXX] small businesses . an overarching theme of our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity and inclusion as an imperative for us , as well as for our clients and their boards . these efforts are further strengthened by strategic partnerships that we have established in areas where we have identified gaps or believe we are able to drive even greater impact through collaboration . we believe our ability to achieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent on the strengths and talents of our people , and we recognize that our people are able to maximize their impact by collaborating in a diverse and inclusive work environment . see “ business — human capital management ” for information about our human capital management goals , programs and policies . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries competition the financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive , and we expect them to remain so . our competitors provide investment banking , market - making and asset management services , private banking and lending , commercial lending , credit cards , transaction banking , deposit - taking and other banking products and services , and make investments in securities , commodities , derivatives , real estate , loans and other financial assets . our competitors include brokers and dealers , investment banking firms , commercial banks , credit card issuers , insurance companies , investment advisers , mutual funds , hedge funds , private equity funds , merchant banks , consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet - based companies . some of our competitors operate globally and others regionally , and we compete based on a number of factors , including transaction execution , client experience , products and services , innovation , reputation and price . we have faced , and expect to continue to face , pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks . in particular , corporate clients seek such commitments ( such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities ) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments . consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets . as a result , we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions . to capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities , we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the u.s . we also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services , such as independent advisory firms . some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are , and , as described below , our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them . a number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition . efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking , market - making , consumer , wealth management and asset management businesses . for example , the increasing volume of trades executed electronically , through the internet and through alternative trading systems , has increased the pressure on trading commissions , in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non - electronic trading . it appears that this trend toward low - commission trading will continue . price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it ( i.e. , bid / offer spread ) , which has affected our market - making businesses . the increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services . in addition , we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices , and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution . we and other banks also compete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer . increases in short - term interest rates have resulted in and may continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing , as well as competition from non - deposit financial products . we also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer . in some circumstances , our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer , including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we can not or may choose not to provide . our competitors may also develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] -

frank act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between u.s.-based and non - u.s.-based banking organizations and give non - u.s.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the u.s . and to form and invest in funds outside the u.s . likewise , the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under title vii of the dodd - frank act depend , in part , on the location of the counterparties to the transaction . the impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve , the extent of international convergence , and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes , as described further in “ regulation ” below . we also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees . our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees , retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions , including in jurisdictions such as new york state where we are required to publish certain compensation information as part of the employee hiring process . our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by , and the standards of , the frb and other regulators inside and outside the u.s . , including the prudential regulation authority ( pra ) and the financial conduct authority ( fca ) in the u.k . we also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight . see “ regulation — compensation practices ” and “ risk factors — competition — our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees ” in part i , item 1a of this form [XX] -

, among others . banking supervision and regulation the basel committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation . however , the basel committee ’s standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards . the implications of basel committee standards and related regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally , and the market practices and structures that develop . capital and liquidity requirements . we and gs bank usa are subject to risk - based regulatory capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the frb ( capital framework ) . the capital framework is largely based on the basel committee ’s framework for strengthening the regulation , supervision and risk management of banks ( basel iii ) and also implements certain provisions of the dodd - frank act . under the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies ’ tailoring framework , we and gs bank usa are subject to “ category i ” standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank ( g - sib ) . accordingly , we and gs bank usa are “ advanced approach ” banking organizations . under the capital framework , we and gs bank usa must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets , liabilities and certain off - balance sheet items . the sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators . we and gs bank usa are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies . gsbe is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the e.u . capital requirements regulation , as amended ( crr ) , and the e.u . capital requirements directive , as amended ( crd ) , which are largely based on basel iii . the crr requires large institutions with securities traded on a regulated market of a member state to make qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to environmental , social and governance risks on a semi - annual basis . these requirements will apply to our e.u.-regulated entities beginning in january [XXXX] . gsi and gsib are subject to the u.k . capital and liquidity frameworks prescribed in the pra rulebook and the u.k . capital requirements regulation , which are also largely based on basel iii and are generally aligned with the e.u . capital and liquidity frameworks . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries risk - based capital ratios . as advanced approach banking organizations , we and gs bank usa calculate risk - based capital ratios in accordance with both the standardized and advanced capital rules . both the standardized and advanced capital rules include minimum risk - based capital requirements and additional capital conservation buffer requirements that must be satisfied solely with common equity tier [X] ( cet1 ) capital . failure to satisfy a buffer requirement in full would result in constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation . the severity of the constraints would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the organization ’s “ eligible retained income , ” defined as the greater of ( i ) net income for the four preceding quarters , net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income ; and ( ii ) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters . for group inc . , the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a [X.X] % buffer ( under the advanced capital rules ) , a stress capital buffer ( scb ) ( under the standardized capital rules ) , and both a countercyclical buffer and the g - sib surcharge ( under both capital rules ) . for gs bank usa , the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a [X.X] % buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer . in july [XXXX] , the frb issued a proposal to implement a revised g - sib assessment methodology and to revise certain systemic indicators to be based on daily or monthly average values during each year , instead of year - end values . the scb is based on the results of the federal reserve ’s supervisory stress tests and our planned common stock dividends and is likely to change over time based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests . see “ stress tests and capital planning ” below . the countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to category i , ii or iii standards , including us and gs bank usa . several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers . the g - sib surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us may change in the future , including due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes . as a result , the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted a rule that implements the basel committee ’s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts ( sa - ccr ) . under the rule , “ advanced approach ” banking organizations are required to use sa - ccr in the calculation of their standardized risk - weighted assets ( rwas ) and , with some adjustments , in the determination of their supplementary leverage ratios ( slrs ) discussed below . the capital requirements applicable to gsbe , gsi and gsib include both minimum requirements and buffers . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital ” in part ii , item [X] of this form 10‑k and note [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form 10‑k for information about our capital ratios and those of gs bank usa , gsbe , gsi and gsib . the basel committee standards include guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective ( d - sibs ) . depending on how these guidelines are implemented by national regulators , they may apply to certain subsidiaries of g - sibs . these guidelines are in addition to the framework for g - sibs , but are more principles - based . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have not designated any d - sibs . the crd and crr provide that institutions that are systemically important at the e.u . or member state level , known as other systemically important institutions ( o - siis ) , may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements , according to their degree of systemic importance ( o - sii buffers ) . bafin has identified gsbe as an o - sii in germany and set an o - sii buffer . in the u.k . , the pra has identified goldman sachs group uk limited ( gsg uk ) , the parent company of gsi and gsib , as an o - sii but has not applied an o - sii buffer . the basel committee has finalized revisions to the basel iii capital requirements ( basel iii revisions ) , and in july [XXXX] , the u.s . bank regulatory agencies proposed a rule implementing the basel iii revisions and the fundamental review of the trading book ( frtb ) . the frtb , among other things , revises the standardized and internal model - based approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the proposed effective date for the u.s . proposal is july [X] , [XXXX] , with a three - year transition period for the calculation of expanded risk - based approach rwas . the proposal includes the replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded risk - based approach , which eliminates the use of internal models to calculate rwas for credit and operational risk . the proposal incorporates the application of the scb requirements in the expanded risk - based approach . the credit risk component of the expanded risk - based approach would include new risk weights for many counterparty and exposure types , a revised collateral haircut approach for certain collateralized transactions and additional restrictions for recognizing collateral in certain securities financing transactions . under the proposed rules , the rwas for operational risk would be calculated primarily based on revenues and historical losses . in addition , the proposal introduces the frtb , which would replace the market risk rule for both the standardized and expanded risk - based approaches and introduce a new credit valuation adjustment ( cva ) risk rwa calculation for the expanded risk - based approach . we continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed rules , but we preliminarily estimate that under these rules , if adopted as proposed and if our assets and liabilities remain largely consistent with those as of december [XXXX] , our regulatory capital requirements could increase by approximately [XX] % on a fully phased - in basis . the european commission has proposed rules to implement the basel iii revisions and the frtb , and the council of the e.u . has published the consolidated version reflecting the e.u . trilogue agreement . the agreed e.u . proposal contemplates amendments to the crr and the crd , referred to as crr iii and crd vi , generally taking effect in january [XXXX] . the proposed amendments include revised rules for market risk capital , a new standardized approach for operational risk and cva risk capital and a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach , commonly known as the “ output floor . ” in december [XXXX] , the pra issued near final market risk rules for the u.k . which are expected to be effective from july [X] , [XXXX] . the pra also issued its consultation on the implementation of the basel iii revisions , with a proposed effective date of july [X] , [XXXX] . under the pra consultation , our u.k . subsidiaries are not expected to be subject to a floor on internally modeled capital requirements . the pra has also published near final rules for cva risk , counterparty credit risk and operational risk , in addition to market risk . the basel committee has published an updated securitization framework and a revised g - sib assessment methodology . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies ’ july [XXXX] proposal would implement the updated securitization framework . the updated securitization framework has been implemented in the e.u . and u.k . the basel committee has also published a final standard on the prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures . the basel committee contemplates that national regulators will have incorporated the standard into local capital requirements by january [X] , [XXXX] . u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies and e.u . and u.k . authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the standards . leverage ratios . under the capital framework , we and gs bank usa are subject to tier [X] leverage ratios and slrs established by the frb . as a g - sib , the slr requirements applicable to us include both a minimum requirement and a buffer requirement , which operates in the same manner as the risk - based buffer requirements described above . in april [XXXX] , the frb and the occ issued a proposed rule which would ( i ) replace the current [X] % slr buffer for g - sibs , including us , with a buffer equal to [XX] % of their g - sib surcharge and ( ii ) revise the [X] % slr requirement for category i banks , such as gs bank usa , to be “ well capitalized ” with a requirement equal to [X] % plus [XX] % of their parent ’s g - sib surcharge . gsbe and certain of our u.k . entities are also subject to requirements relating to leverage ratios , which are generally based on the basel committee leverage ratio standards . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k and note [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for information about our and gs bank usa ’s tier [X] leverage ratios and slrs , and gsi ’s leverage ratio . liquidity ratios . the basel committee ’s framework for liquidity risk measurement , standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests : the liquidity coverage ratio ( lcr ) and the net stable funding ratio ( nsfr ) . the lcr rule issued by the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and gs bank usa is generally consistent with the basel committee ’s framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered , high - quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short - term liquidity stress scenario . we and gs bank usa are required to maintain a minimum lcr of [XXX] % . gsbe is subject to the lcr rule approved by the european parliament and council , and gsi and gsib are subject to the u.k . regulatory authorities ’ lcr rules , which are generally consistent with the basel committee ’s framework . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the nsfr is designed to promote medium- and long - term stable funding of the assets and off - balance sheet activities of banking organizations over a one - year time horizon . the basel committee ’s nsfr framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum nsfr of [XXX] % . we and gs bank usa are subject to the u.s . nsfr rule and we are required to disclose the quarterly average of our daily nsfr on a semi - annual basis . the crr implements the nsfr for certain e.u . financial institutions , including gsbe . the nsfr requirement implemented in the u.k . is applicable to both gsi and gsib . the frb ’s enhanced prudential standards require bhcs with $ [XXX] billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards , which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for [XX] days , and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management . although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the lcr , it is a separate requirement . gsbe also has its own liquidity planning process , which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under german regulatory requirements and the ecb guide to internal liquidity adequacy assessment process ( ilaap ) . gsi and gsib have their own liquidity planning processes , which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the pra ’s ilaap . see “ available information ” below and “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk management — overview and structure of risk management ” and “ — liquidity risk management — liquidity regulatory framework ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for information about the lcr and nsfr , as well as our risk management practices and liquidity . stress tests and capital planning . the frb ’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ( ccar ) is designed to ensure that large bhcs , including us , have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress . as required by the frb , we perform an annual capital stress test and incorporate the results into an annual capital plan , which we submit to the frb for review . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital — capital management — capital planning and stress testing process ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about our annual capital plan . as described in “ available information ” below , summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website . as part of the ccar process , the frb evaluates our plan to make capital distributions across a range of macroeconomic and company - specific assumptions , based on our and the frb ’s own stress tests . under the frb ’s rule applicable to bhcs with $ [XXX] billion or more in total consolidated assets , including us , the scb applies to the standardized approach capital requirements . the scb reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the ccar stress tests , as calculated by the frb , and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends . the scb , which is subject to a [X.X] % floor , is generally effective on october [X] of each year and remains in effect until october [X] of the following year , unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission of a capital plan . see “ available information ” below and “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital ” in part ii , item [X] of this form 10‑k for information about our scb requirement . the scb rule requires a bhc to receive the frb ’s approval for any dividend , stock repurchase or other capital distribution , other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument , if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan , which may occur if the bhc determines there has been or will be a “ material change ” in its risk profile , financial condition or corporate structure since the plan was last submitted , or if the frb directs the bhc to revise and resubmit its capital plan . u.s . depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $ [XXX] billion or more that are subsidiaries of u.s . g - sibs , such as gs bank usa , are required to submit annual company - run stress test results to the frb . gsbe also has its own capital and stress testing process , which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under german regulatory requirements and the ecb guide to internal capital adequacy assessment process ( icaap ) . in addition , gsi and gsib have their own capital planning and stress testing processes , which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the pra ’s icaap guidelines . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries limitations on the payment of dividends . u.s . federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by u.s . depository institutions , such as gs bank usa . in general , the amount of dividends that may be paid by gs bank usa is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test . under the recent earnings test , a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year ’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years , unless the entity obtains regulatory approval . under the undivided profits test , a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity ’s undivided profits ( generally , accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus ) , unless the entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval . the applicable u.s . banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if , in the banking regulator ’s opinion , payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization . source of strength . the dodd - frank act requires bhcs to act as a source of strength to their u.s . bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries . this support may be required by the frb at times when bhcs might otherwise determine not to provide it . capital loans by a bhc to a u.s . subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank . in addition , if a bhc commits to a u.s . federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary , whether in response to the frb ’s invoking its source - of - strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures , that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the bhc and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment , ahead of other creditors of the bhc . transactions between affiliates . transactions between gs bank usa or its subsidiaries , including gsbe , and group inc . or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the federal reserve act and regulations issued by the frb . these laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions ( such as loans and other credit extensions , including credit exposure arising from resale agreements , securities borrowing and derivative transactions , from gs bank usa or its subsidiaries to group inc . or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by gs bank usa or its subsidiaries from group inc . or its other subsidiaries and affiliates ) that may take place and generally require those transactions , to the extent permitted , to be on market terms or better to gs bank usa or its subsidiaries . these laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between gs bank usa and its subsidiaries . similarly , german regulatory requirements provide that certain transactions between gsbe and gs bank usa or its other affiliates , including group inc . , must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements . pra rules also provide requirements for transactions between gsi and gsib and their respective affiliates . resolution and recovery plans . we are required by the frb and the fdic to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure ( resolution plan ) . if these regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan or that its resolution plan , after any permitted resubmission , is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the u.s . bankruptcy code , they may jointly impose more stringent capital , leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth , activities or operations , or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations , in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure . the frb and fdic require u.s . g - sibs to submit resolution plans every two years ( alternating between submissions of full plans and targeted plans that include only select information ) . we submitted our [XXXX] resolution plan , which was a full submission , in june [XXXX] . our next required submission is a targeted submission by july [X] , [XXXX] . see “ risk factors — legal and regulatory — the application of group inc . ’s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for group inc . ’s security holders ” in part i , item 1a of this form [XX] - k and “ available information ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about our resolution plan . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we are also required by the frb to submit , on a periodic basis , a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk , maintain sufficient liquidity and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress . certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to similar recovery plan requirements . gs bank usa is required to provide a resolution plan to the fdic that must , among other things , demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities . gs bank usa ’s most recent resolution plan was submitted in december [XXXX] . in august [XXXX] , the fdic proposed to revise its current rule that requires the submission of resolution plans by insured depository institutions ( idis ) with $ [XX] billion or more in total assets . the proposal would revise the requirements regarding the content and timing of resolution submissions , as well as interim supplements to those submissions provided to the fdic . under the proposal , idis with $ [XXX] billion or more in total assets , including gs bank usa , would submit full resolution plans biennially . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts ( qfcs ) entered into by g - sibs . the rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed g - sib by limiting the ability of the g - sib to enter into a qfc unless ( i ) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the g‑sib or one of its affiliates into resolution , ( ii ) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement , and ( iii ) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the dodd - frank act orderly liquidation authority ( ola ) and the federal deposit insurance act of [XXXX] ( fdia ) , described below . gs bank usa has achieved compliance by adhering to the international swaps and derivatives association universal resolution stay protocol ( isda universal protocol ) and international swaps and derivatives association [XXXX] u.s . resolution stay protocol ( u.s . isda protocol ) described below . certain of our other subsidiaries also adhere to these protocols . the isda universal protocol imposes a stay on certain cross - default and early termination rights within standard isda derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction , including a resolution under ola or the fdia in the u.s . the u.s . isda protocol , which was based on the isda universal protocol , was created to allow market participants to comply with the final qfc rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies . the e.u . bank recovery and resolution directive ( brrd ) , as amended by the brrd ii , establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the e.u . , such as gsbe . the brrd provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre - emptively address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers ’ exposure to losses . the brrd requires e.u . member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and , where relevant , e.u . resolution authorities , including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity . financial institutions in the e.u . must provide that contracts governed by non - e.u . law recognize those temporary stay and bail - in powers unless doing so would be impracticable . gsbe is under the direct authority of the single resolution board for resolution planning . e.u . law requires financial institutions in the e.u . , including subsidiaries of non - e.u . groups , to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the e.u . entities . gsbe ’s primary regulator with respect to recovery planning is the ecb , and it is also regulated by bafin and deutsche bundesbank . the u.k . special resolution regime confers substantially the same powers on the bank of england , as the u.k . resolution authority , and substantially the same requirements on u.k . financial institutions . further , certain u.k . financial institutions , including gsi and gsib , are required to meet the bank of england ’s expectations contained in the u.k . resolution assessment framework , including with respect to loss absorbency , contractual stays , operational continuity and funding in resolution . they are also required by the pra to submit solvent wind - down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment . the pra is also the regulatory authority in the u.k . that supervises recovery planning , and gsi and gsib are each required to submit recovery plans to the pra . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries total loss - absorbing capacity ( tlac ) . the frb ’s tlac rule , among other things , establishes minimum tlac requirements and establishes minimum requirements for “ eligible long - term debt ” ( i.e. , debt that is unsecured , has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria ) . in august [XXXX] , the frb proposed to introduce a minimum denomination requirement for eligible long - term debt , among other changes . the rule also prohibits a bhc that has been designated as a u.s . g - sib from ( i ) guaranteeing subsidiaries ’ liabilities that are subject to early termination provisions if the bhc enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding , subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the u.s . federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on qfcs ; ( ii ) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries ; ( iii ) issuing short - term debt to third parties ; or ( iv ) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties . additionally , the rule caps , at [X] % of the value of the parent company ’s eligible tlac , the amount of unsecured non - contingent third - party liabilities that are not eligible long - term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long - term debt . the crr , the brrd and u.k . financial services regime also impose minimum tlac requirements on g - sibs . for example , the crr requires e.u . subsidiaries of a non - e.u . g - sib that exceed the threshold of [X] % of the g - sib ’s rwas , operating income or leverage exposure , such as gsbe , to meet internal tlac requirements . under the u.k . financial services regime , gsg uk exceeds the applicable thresholds and therefore , it is subject to internal tlac requirements . the crd required a non - e.u . group with more than € [XX] billion of assets in the e.u . , such as us , to establish an e.u . intermediate holding company ( e.u . ihc ) by december [XX] , [XXXX] if it has , as in our case , two or more of certain types of e.u . financial institution subsidiaries , including broker - dealers and banks . a non - e.u . group may have two e.u . ihcs if a request for a second is approved , and in september [XXXX] , the ecb granted gsbe and gspic an exemption to operate under two e.u . ihcs . the crr requires e.u . ihcs to satisfy capital and liquidity requirements , a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities ( mrel ) , and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level . the u.k . has not implemented a similar requirement to establish an ihc ; however , the pra has introduced a requirement that certain u.k . financial holding companies or a designated u.k . group entity be responsible for the u.k . group ’s regulatory compliance . we have designated gsi for that responsibility . the brrd ii and the u.k . resolution regime subject institutions to an mrel , which is generally consistent with the financial stability board ’s ( fsb ’s ) tlac standard . gsi is required to maintain a minimum level of internal mrel and provide the bank of england the right to exercise bail - in triggers over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by gsi . these triggers enable the bank of england to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity . the triggers can be exercised by the bank of england if it determines that gsi has reached the point of non - viability and the frb and the fdic have not objected to the bail - in or if group inc . enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings . the single resolution board imposes internal mrel requirements applicable to gsbe . insolvency of a bhc or idi . the dodd - frank act created a resolution regime , ola , for bhcs and their affiliates that are systemically important . under ola , the fdic may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non - bank subsidiaries if , upon the recommendation of applicable regulators , the u.s . secretary of the treasury determines , among other things , that the institution is in default or in danger of default , that the institution ’s failure would have serious adverse effects on the u.s . financial system and that resolution under ola would avoid or mitigate those effects . if the fdic is appointed as receiver under ola , then the powers of the receiver , and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution , would be determined under ola , and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply . the powers of the receiver under ola are generally based on the powers of the fdic as receiver for depository institutions under the fdia , described below . substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between ola and the u.s . bankruptcy code , including the right of the fdic under ola to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances , the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors ’ claims ( as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings ) , and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a “ bridge ” entity . in addition , ola limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross - defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership . the fdic has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed fhc by transferring its assets to a “ bridge ” holding company under its “ single point of entry ” or “ spoe ” strategy pursuant to ola . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries under the fdia , if the fdic is appointed as conservator or receiver for an idi such as gs bank usa , upon its insolvency or in certain other events , the fdic has broad powers , including the power : • to transfer any of the idi ’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor , including a newly formed “ bridge ” bank , without the approval of the depository institution ’s creditors ; • to enforce the idi ’s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the fdic in that capacity ; or • to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the idi is a party , the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the repudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the idi . in addition , the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an idi would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims , including deposits at non - u.s . branches and claims of debtholders of the idi , in the “ liquidation or other resolution ” of such an institution by any receiver . as a result , whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of gs bank usa , the debtholders ( other than depositors at u.s . branches ) would be treated differently from , and could receive , if anything , substantially less than , the depositors at u.s . branches of gs bank usa . deposit insurance . deposits at gs bank usa have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits . the fdic ’s deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on idis . gs bank usa ’s assessment ( subject to adjustment by the fdic ) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period , its supervisory ratings and specified forward - looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate . in addition , the fdic must recover , by special assessment , losses to the fdic deposit insurance fund as a result of the fdic ’s use of the systemic risk exception to the least cost resolution test under the fdia . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — operating expenses ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for information about the estimated impact of the fdic special assessment fee . the deposits of gsbe are covered by the german statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law . in addition , gsbe has elected to participate in the german voluntary deposit protection program which provides further insurance for certain eligible deposits beyond the coverage of the german statutory deposit program . eligible deposits at gsib and the london branch of gs bank usa are covered by the u.k . financial services compensation scheme up to the applicable limits . prompt corrective action . the u.s . federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of [XXXX] ( fdicia ) requires the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies to take “ prompt corrective action ” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements . fdicia establishes five capital categories for fdic - insured banks , such as gs bank usa : well - capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized . an institution may be downgraded to , or deemed to be in , a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters . fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations , management and capital distributions , as the capital category of an institution declines . failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital . ultimately , critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator , as described in “ insolvency of an idi or a bhc ” above . the prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to bhcs . however , the frb is authorized to take appropriate action at the bhc level , based upon the undercapitalized status of the bhc ’s depository institution subsidiaries . in certain instances , relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary , the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary ’s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee . furthermore , in the event of the bankruptcy of the bhc , the guarantee would take priority over the bhc ’s general unsecured creditors , as described in “ source of strength ” above . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries volcker rule and other restrictions on activities . as a bhc , we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we may engage . volcker rule . the volcker rule prohibits “ proprietary trading , ” but permits activities such as underwriting , market making and risk - mitigation hedging , requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record - keeping requirements . in addition , the volcker rule limits the sponsorship of , and investment in , “ covered funds ” ( as defined in the rule ) by banking entities , including us . it also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds , similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates . covered funds include our private equity funds , certain of our credit and real estate funds , our hedge funds and certain other investment structures . the limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to [X] % or less of the fund ’s net asset value , and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to [X] % or less of our tier [X] capital . other restrictions . fhcs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for bhcs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for fhcs . the broader range of permissible activities for fhcs includes underwriting , dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non - fhcs ( merchant banking activities ) . in addition , certain fhcs , including us , are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the u.s . that may otherwise be impermissible for bhcs , so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal [X] % or more of their consolidated assets . the frb , however , has the authority to limit an fhc ’s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible , and will likely do so if the fhc does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the frb . for example , if an fhc or any of its u.s . depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well - capitalized or well - managed , the frb may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements , as well as additional limitations or conditions . if the deficiencies persist , the fhc may be required to divest its u.s . depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities . in addition , we are required to obtain prior frb approval before certain acquisitions and before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the u.s . u.s . g - sibs , like us , are also required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits , which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions . the new york state banking law imposes lending limits ( which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions ) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of gs bank usa ’s activities . the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high - level principles for safe - and - sound leveraged lending , including underwriting standards , valuation and stress testing . this guidance has , among other things , limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions . as a german credit institution , gsbe is subject to volcker rule - type prohibitions under german banking law and regulations because its financial assets exceed certain thresholds . prohibited activities include ( i ) proprietary trading , ( ii ) high - frequency trading at a german trading venue , and ( iii ) lending and guarantee businesses with german hedge funds , german funds of hedge funds or any non - german substantially leveraged alternative investment funds , unless an exclusion or an exemption applies . as part of its implementation of the basel iii revisions , the e.u . is introducing new restrictions on the provision of certain “ core ” banking services cross - border into the e.u . and new requirements on e.u . branches of third - country banks , such as the german branch of gsib . u.k . banks that have over £ [XX] billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities , commonly known as “ ring - fencing . ” gsib is not currently subject to the ring - fencing requirement . in september [XXXX] , the treasury department of the u.k . government proposed to increase the ring - fencing deposit threshold from £ [XX] billion to £ [XX] billion of core retail deposits . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries community reinvestment act ( cra ) . in [XXXX] , gs bank usa ceased to be assessed as a “ wholesale bank ” for cra and new york community reinvestment act ( nycra ) compliance purposes . gs bank usa instead adopted a strategic plan that was approved by the frb and nydfs . the [XXXX] strategic plan will be in effect through [XXXX] . while the plan is in effect , its terms will not be impacted by the revised federal cra regulations , jointly published by the fdic , frb , and occ in october [XXXX] . the revised federal cra regulations tailor cra evaluations to bank size and type , with many of the changes applying only to banks with over $ [X] billion in assets and several applying only to banks with over $ [XX] billion in assets , including gs bank usa . the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution ’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community , but depository institutions may only receive cra credit for certain types of lending and for lending , investments and services that support community development , as defined in the cra regulations . the cra and its regulations require each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency , in connection with its examination of a depository institution , to assess such institution ’s record of meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that institution , including the needs of low- and moderate - income borrowers and neighborhoods , and to make such assessment available to the public . the assessment also is part of the frb ’s consideration of applications to acquire , merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company , to assume deposits of or acquire assets from another depository institution , to establish a new domestic branch office that will accept deposits , or to relocate an office . in the case of a bhc applying for approval to acquire a bank or another bhc , the frb will assess the records of performance under the cra of the idis involved in the transaction , and such records may be the basis for denying the application . if gs bank usa fails to maintain at least a “ satisfactory ” rating under the cra , it would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions . we are also subject to provisions of the new york banking law that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon new york state - chartered banks , such as gs bank usa , to serve the credit needs of its local community ( nycra ) . such obligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the cra . the nycra requires the nydfs to make a periodic written assessment of an institution ’s compliance with the nycra , and to make such assessment available to the public . the nycra also requires the nydfs to consider the nycra rating when reviewing an application to engage in certain transactions , including mergers , asset purchases and the establishment of domestic branch offices , and provides that such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application . broker - dealer and securities regulation our broker - dealer subsidiaries , including gs&co . , are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business , including sales methods , trade practices , the use and safekeeping of clients ’ funds and securities , capital structure , record - keeping , the financing of clients ’ purchases , and the conduct of directors , officers and employees . in the u.s . , the sec is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws . u.s . state securities and other u.s . regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over gs&co . for a description of net capital requirements applicable to gs&co . , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital management and regulatory capital — subsidiary capital requirements — u.s . regulated broker - dealer subsidiaries ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. the sec has adopted a rule , effective january [X] , [XXXX] , that requires lenders of securities to provide the material terms of securities lending transactions to finra and for finra to make certain terms publicly available . reporting under this rule will be required beginning in january [XXXX] . the sec requires broker - dealers to act in the best interest of their retail customers . sec rules require broker - dealers to provide a standardized , short - form disclosure highlighting services offered , applicable standards of conduct , fees and costs , the differences between brokerage and advisory services , and any conflicts of interest . in addition , several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to broker - dealers . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX]

goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the following are detailed descriptions of our risk factors summarized above : market our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and broader economic conditions . many of our businesses , by their nature , do not produce predictable earnings , and all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally , both directly and through their impact on client activity levels and creditworthiness . these conditions can change suddenly and negatively . our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate . a favorable business environment is generally characterized by , among other factors , high global gross domestic product growth , regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent , liquid and efficient capital markets , low inflation , business , consumer and investor confidence , stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings . unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by : low levels of or declines in economic growth , business activity or investor , business or consumer confidence ; concerns over a potential recession ; changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns ; pandemics ; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital ; illiquid markets ; increases in inflation , interest rates , exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates ; high levels of inflation or stagflation ; concerns about sovereign defaults ; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy , government shutdowns , debt ceilings or funding ; the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes ; limitations on international trade and travel ; laws and regulations that limit trading in , or the issuance of , securities of issuers outside their domestic markets ; outbreaks or worsening of domestic or international tensions or hostilities , terrorism , nuclear proliferation , cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication , energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty ; corporate , political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets ; extreme weather events or other natural disasters ; or a combination of these or other factors . the financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes , by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults . in addition , concerns about actual or potential increases in interest rates , inflation and other borrowing costs , a public health emergency , sovereign debt risk and its impact on the relevant sovereign banking system , and limitations on international trade , have , at times , negatively impacted the levels of client activity . general uncertainty about economic , political and market activities , and the scope , timing and impact of regulatory reform , as well as weak consumer , investor and ceo confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty , has in the past negatively impacted client activity , which has in the past adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect many of our businesses . periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market - making businesses . changes , or proposed changes , to u.s . international trade and investment policies , particularly with important trading partners , have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets . continued or escalating tensions may result in further actions taken by the u.s . or other countries that could disrupt international trade and investment and adversely affect financial markets . those actions could include , among others , the implementation of sanctions , tariffs or foreign exchange measures , the large - scale sale of u.s . treasury securities or other restrictions on cross - border trade , investment , or transfer of information or technology . such developments have in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our or our clients ’ businesses . financial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained . in addition , liquidity in the financial markets has in the past been , and could in the future be , negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries in june [XXXX] , the u.s . federal government suspended the federal debt limit until [XXXX] . if congress does not raise the debt ceiling prior to [XXXX] , the u.s . could default on its obligations , including treasury securities that play an integral role in financial markets . a default by the u.s . could result in unprecedented market volatility and illiquidity , heightened operational risks relating to the clearance and settlement of transactions , margin and other disputes with clients and counterparties , an adverse impact to investors including money market funds that invest in u.s . treasuries , downgrades in the u.s . credit rating , further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and a recession in the u.s . or other economies . continued uncertainty relating to the debt ceiling could result in downgrades of the u.s . credit rating , which could adversely affect market conditions , lead to margin disputes , further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and necessitate significant operational changes among market participants , including us . a downgrade of the u.s . federal government ’s credit rating could also materially and adversely affect the market for repurchase agreements , securities borrowing and lending , and other financings typically collateralized by u.s . treasury or agency obligations . further , the fair value , liquidity and credit ratings of securities issued by , or other obligations of , agencies of the u.s . government or related to the u.s . government or its agencies , as well as municipal bonds could be similarly adversely affected . an increasing frequency of government shutdowns , or near shutdowns , in the u.s . could also lead to uncertainty as to the continued funding of the u.s . government , which could , in turn , adversely affect the credit ratings of the u.s . and the market for u.s . treasury or agency obligations . in [XXXX] , numerous elections will be held globally . as a result , there may be significant market uncertainty in the periods leading up to and/or following the elections and this could cause higher volatility , lower levels of market activity and other adverse conditions for our businesses . the outcomes of the elections could also result in changes in policy , which could also have adverse effects on us or the business environment in which we operate more generally . our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values , particularly where we have net “ long ” positions , receive fees based on the value of assets managed , or receive or post collateral . many of our businesses have net “ long ” positions in debt securities , loans , derivatives , mortgages , equities ( including private equity and real estate ) and most other asset classes . these include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients ’ activities , including our exchange - based market - making activities , or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products , as well as through our currencies , commodities , equities and mortgage - related activities . in addition , we invest in similar asset classes . substantially all of our investing and market - making positions and a portion of our loans are marked - to - market on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and promptly impact our earnings , unless we have effectively “ hedged ” our exposures to those declines . in certain circumstances ( particularly in the case of credit products , including leveraged loans , and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets ) , it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and , to the extent that we do so , the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets . sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated , and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate , the trading markets for certain assets , which may make it difficult to sell , hedge or value such assets . we may incur losses from time to time as trading markets deteriorate or cease to function , including with respect to loan commitments we have made or securities offerings we have underwritten . the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets has in the past negatively affected , and may in the future negatively affect , our capital , liquidity or leverage ratios , our funding costs and our ability to deploy capital . in our exchange - based market - making activities , we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market , including by purchasing securities in a declining market . in markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets , this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity . we receive asset - based management fees based on the value of our clients ’ portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and , in some cases , we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments . declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients ’ portfolios or fund assets , which in turn would typically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties . when the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline , the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or , if possible , reduce its trading position . an example of such a situation is a “ margin call ” in connection with a brokerage account . therefore , declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased . if we are the party providing collateral , this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral , this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties . in addition , volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets , which can lead to costly and time - consuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral , as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral . in cases where we foreclose on collateral , sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral have in the past resulted in , and may in the future result in , significant losses to us , especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation . in addition , we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents , was conducted in an improper manner , including in violation of law , or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business . our market - making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility . certain of our market - making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients , and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the results of these activities . increased volatility , while it can increase trading volumes and spreads , also increases risk as measured by value - at - risk ( var ) and increases risks in connection with our market - making activities and can cause us to reduce our inventory . limiting the size of our market - making positions can adversely affect our profitability . in periods when volatility is increasing , but asset values are declining significantly , it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts . in those circumstances , we have been and may in the future be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our var . in addition , increases in volatility increase the level of our rwas , which increases the amount of capital that we are required to hold , and this can reduce our profitability and reduce our ability to distribute capital to our shareholders . our investment banking , client intermediation , asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and ceos due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic , geopolitical or market conditions . our investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions . poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and ceo confidence , resulting in significant industry - wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of advisory transactions , which would likely have and have in the past had an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins . in particular , because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions , a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business . similarly , in recent years , cross - border initial public offerings and other securities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new issuance activity . legislative , regulatory or other changes that limit trading in , or the issuance of , securities outside the issuers ’ domestic markets , that result in or could result in the delisting or removal of securities from exchanges or indices , have in the past adversely affected and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting and client intermediation businesses . furthermore , changes , or proposed changes , to international trade and investment policies of the u.s . and other countries could negatively affect market activity levels and our revenues . in certain circumstances , market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility . market uncertainty , volatility and adverse economic conditions , as well as declines in asset values , may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues , principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses . even if clients do not withdraw their funds , they may invest them in products that generate less fee income . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees . poor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses , due to either general market conditions or underperformance ( relative to our competitors or to benchmarks ) by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell , affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients . this could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on aus or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products , such as structured notes or derivatives . to the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer , we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees . further , if , due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise , clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees ( e.g. , passively managed or fixed income products ) , our average effective management fee will decline further and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected . inflation has had , and could continue to have , a negative effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . inflationary pressures have affected economies , financial markets and market participants worldwide . inflationary pressures have increased certain of our operating expenses , and have adversely affected consumer sentiment and ceo confidence . central bank responses to inflationary pressures have also resulted in higher market interest rates , which , in turn , have contributed to lower activity levels across financial markets , in particular for debt underwriting transactions and mortgage originations , and resulted in lower values for certain financial assets which have adversely affected our equity and debt investments . higher interest rates increase our borrowing costs and have required us to increase interest paid on our deposits . if inflationary pressures persist , our expenses may increase further ; we may be unable to achieve our efficiency ratio target ; activity levels for certain of our businesses , in particular debt underwriting and mortgages , may decline ; our interest expense could increase faster than our interest income , reducing our net interest income and net interest margin ; certain of our investments could continue to incur losses or generally low levels of returns ; aus could decline , or the composition of our aus could shift to lower fee products , reducing management and other fees ; economies worldwide could experience recessions ; and we could continue to operate in a generally unfavorable economic and market environment . liquidity our liquidity , profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets . liquidity is essential to our businesses . it is of critical importance to us , as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity . our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets , an inability to raise or retain deposits , an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally , an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments , lack of timely settlement of transactions , unusual deposit outflows , or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral , such as in march [XXXX] , when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the covid-19 pandemic . this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control , such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us , or even by the perception among market participants that we , or other market participants , are experiencing greater liquidity risk . we employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks . the financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex , and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress . our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets , which could restrict liquidity for our positions . further , our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets , as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time , as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations . for example , in [XXXX] , an investment management firm with large positions with several financial institutions defaulted , resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those positions . in addition , clearinghouses , exchanges and other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise set - off rights or the right to require additional collateral , including in difficult market conditions , which could further impair our liquidity . numerous regulations have been adopted that impose more stringent liquidity requirements on large financial institutions , including us . these regulations require us to hold large amounts of highly liquid assets and reduce our flexibility to source and deploy funding . in addition , our need to manage our operations in light of certain regulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in gsib or other funding , which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets , including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit . widening credit spreads , as well as significant declines in the availability of credit , have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future . we fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long - term debt and commercial paper , by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries , by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities . we seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis . any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses . if our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost , these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding , both of which could reduce our profitability , particularly in our businesses that involve investing , lending and market making . our clients engaging in mergers , acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions . a lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size , volume and timing of our clients ’ merger and acquisition transactions , particularly large transactions , and adversely affect our advisory and underwriting businesses . our credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets . a lack of liquidity reduces price transparency , increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size , all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses . reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding . our credit ratings are important to our liquidity . a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position , increase our borrowing costs , limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts . under these provisions , counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral . termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements . as of december [XXXX] , our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of $ [XXX] million in the event of a one - notch downgrade of our credit ratings and $ [X.XX] billion in the event of a two - notch downgrade of our credit ratings . a downgrade by any one rating agency , depending on the agency ’s relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade , may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies . for further information about our credit ratings , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk management — liquidity risk management — credit ratings ” in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. our cost of obtaining long - term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads ( the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay ) . increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding . changes in credit spreads are continuous , market - driven , and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements . our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long - term debt . the market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k

to legal , regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to group inc . group inc . is a holding company and , therefore , depends on dividends , distributions , loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations , including debt obligations . many of our subsidiaries , including our broker - dealer and bank subsidiaries , are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc . in addition , our broker - dealer and bank entities and their subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements , as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses . additional restrictions on related - party transactions , increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts , as well as lower earnings , can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of group inc . , including under the frb ’s source of strength requirement , and even require group inc . to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries . restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc . needs to make payments on its obligations , including debt obligations , or dividend payments . in addition , group inc . ’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary ’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary ’s creditors . there has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business . concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to “ ring fence ” or require internal total loss - absorbing capacity ( which may also be subject to “ bail - in ” powers , as described below ) at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities . the result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities , or to group inc . , including in times of stress , thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis . furthermore , group inc . has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries , including gs&co . and gs bank usa , subject to certain exceptions . in addition , group inc . guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction - by - transaction basis , as negotiated with counterparties . these guarantees may require group inc . to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when group inc . is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations . the requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators , and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators , may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long - term debt at group inc . or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities , and may reduce our ability to provide group inc . guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at group inc . resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient . furthermore , arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes . any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany dividends or payments . see “ business — regulation ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about regulatory restrictions . credit our businesses , profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or defaults by third parties . we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money , securities or other assets will not perform their obligations . these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy , lack of liquidity , operational failure or other reasons . a failure of a significant market participant , or even concerns about a default by such an institution , has in the past and could in the future lead to significant liquidity problems , losses or defaults by other institutions , which in turn could adversely affect us . we are also exposed to the risk of a special assessment , including under the fdia or ola in the event of the failure of a bank or non - bank financial institution , which have in the past , and may in the future , adversely affect our results of operations . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances . in addition , deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold , including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements , could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes . a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results . while in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty , disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets . the termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights . default rates , downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress , increased volatility and illiquidity . as part of our clearing and prime financing activities , we finance our clients ’ positions , and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients . default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee . concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market - making , underwriting , investing and financing activities . concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market - making , underwriting , investing and financing activities . the number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period . moreover , because of concentrated risk , we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors . disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically . in addition , we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities . disruptions in the credit markets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated , and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate , the trading markets for loans we originate . these disruptions have in the past made , and may in the future make , it difficult for us to sell or value such assets , which have in the past resulted , and may in the future result , in losses for us . rules adopted under the dodd - frank act , and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions , require issuers of certain asset - backed securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset - backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset , which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities . our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling , syndicating or securitizing these positions , including during periods of market stress , has in the past negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions , including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers , as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans . in the ordinary course of business , we are at times subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty , borrower , issuer ( including sovereign issuers ) or geographic area or group of related countries , such as the e.u . , and a failure or downgrade of , or default by , such entity could negatively impact our businesses , perhaps materially , and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities , industries , countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated . regulatory reform , including the dodd - frank act , has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearinghouses , central agents or exchanges , which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities . while our activities expose us to many different industries , counterparties and countries , we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities , including brokers and dealers , commercial banks , clearinghouses , exchanges and investment funds . this has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries derivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk , unexpected risks and potential losses . we are party to a large number of derivative transactions , including credit derivatives . many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non - standardized , which can make exiting , transferring or settling positions difficult . many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security , loan or other obligation in order to receive payment . in a number of cases , we do not hold the underlying security , loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security , loan or other obligation . this could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk , as well as increased costs to us . derivative transactions also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed , that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty , or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be “ netted ” against other obligations with such counterparty . in addition , counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized . as a signatory to the isda universal protocol or u.s . isda protocol ( isda protocols ) and being subject to the frb ’s and fdic ’s rules on qfcs and similar rules in other jurisdictions , we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and , as this regime has not yet been tested , we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event . the isda protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts . derivative contracts and other transactions , including secondary bank loan purchases and sales , entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis . while the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement , we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights . in addition , as new complex derivative products are created , covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments , disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise , which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs . the provisions of the dodd - frank act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other otc derivatives , or a market shift toward standardized derivatives , could reduce the risk associated with these transactions , but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks , and could adversely affect our profitability . in addition , these provisions have increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms . operational a failure in our operational systems or human error , malfeasance or other misconduct , could impair our liquidity , disrupt our businesses , result in the disclosure of confidential information , damage our reputation and cause losses . our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a very large number of transactions , many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies , across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies . these transactions , as well as the information technology services we provide to clients , often must adhere to client - specific guidelines , as well as legal and regulatory standards . many rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators , exchanges and investors . compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging , and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely , accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules . as the volume , speed , frequency and complexity of transactions , especially electronic transactions ( as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real - time basis to clients , regulators and exchanges ) increase , developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure has become more challenging , and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions has increased , as have the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences . for example , the transition to a t+1 settlement timeframe in the u.s . in [XXXX] subjects us to increased operational risks with respect to reporting and timely settlement of transactions . these risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility . as with other similarly situated institutions , we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses , including our consumer - oriented activities . allegations or publicity , whether or not accurate , that our underwriting decisions do not treat consumers or clients fairly , or comply with the applicable law or regulation , have in the past resulted and may in the future result in negative publicity , reputational damage and governmental and regulatory scrutiny , investigations and enforcement actions . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our financial , accounting , data processing or other operational systems and facilities have in the past not operated properly in certain respects and may in the future not operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control , such as a spike in transaction volume , adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services . we must continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets , and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or , due to errors in processing such transactions , adversely affect markets , our clients and counterparties or us . enhancements and updates to systems , as well as the requisite training , including in connection with the integration of new businesses , entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones . the use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses and those of our clients and our third - party service providers and vendors . their importance has continued to increase , in particular in light of hybrid work arrangements . computers and computer networks are subject to various risks , including , among others , cyber attacks , inherent technological defects , system failures and human error . for example , fundamental security flaws in computer chips found in many types of these computing devices and phones have been reported in the past and may occur in the future . the use of personal devices by our employees or by our vendors for work - related activities also presents risks related to potential violations of record retention and other requirements . cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing . service disruptions have resulted , and may result in the future , in delays in accessing , or the loss of , data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients ’ access to our platforms . there have been a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud computing providers . addressing these and similar issues could be costly and affect the performance of these businesses and systems . operational risks may be incurred in applying fixes and there may still be residual security risks . notwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology - based risk and control systems , our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource , and , from time to time , they have in the past and may in the future make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies , laws , rules or procedures that are not always caught immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures , which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations . these have in the past and may in the future include calculation errors , mistakes in addressing emails , errors in software or model development or implementation , or simple errors in judgment , as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies , laws , rules or procedures . human errors , malfeasance and other misconduct , including the intentional misuse of client information in connection with insider trading or for other purposes , even if promptly discovered and remediated , has in the past resulted and may in the future result in reputational damage and losses and liabilities for us . the majority of the employees in our primary locations , including the new york metropolitan area , london , bengaluru , hyderabad , hong kong , tokyo , salt lake city and dallas , work in close proximity to one another . our headquarters is located in the new york metropolitan area , and we have our largest employee concentration occupying two principal office buildings near the hudson river waterfront . they are subject to potential catastrophic events , including , but not limited to , terrorist attacks , extreme weather , or other hostile events that could negatively affect our business . notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity , business disruptions impacting our offices and employees could lead to our employees ’ inability to occupy the offices , communicate with or travel to other office locations or work remotely . as a result , our ability to service and interact with clients may be adversely impacted , due to our failure or inability to successfully implement business contingency plans . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries a failure or disruption in our infrastructure , or in the operational systems or infrastructure of third parties , could impair our liquidity , disrupt our businesses , damage our reputation and cause losses . we face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay , termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions , and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows , we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients ’ systems . there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents , exchanges and clearinghouses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges , which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay , termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost - effective alternatives in the event of any such failure , delay , termination or constraint . industry consolidation , whether among market participants or financial intermediaries , increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated , often on an accelerated basis . the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents , exchanges and clearinghouses , and the increased centrality of these entities , increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry - wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business . interconnectivity of financial institutions with other companies through , among other things , application programming interfaces or apis presents similar risks . any such failure , termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions , service our clients , manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our clients , impairment of our liquidity , disruption of our businesses , regulatory intervention or reputational damage . despite our resiliency plans and facilities , our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located . this may include a disruption involving electrical , satellite , undersea cable or other communications , internet , transportation or other facilities used by us , our employees or third parties with which we conduct business , including cloud service providers . these disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of third parties , or as a result of events with a broader impact globally , regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located , including , but not limited to , natural disasters , war , civil unrest , terrorism , economic or political developments , pandemics and weather events . in addition , although we seek to diversify our third - party vendors to increase our resiliency , we are exposed to risks if our vendors operate in the same area and are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us . we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors ’ use of common service providers . additionally , although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology , cryptocurrency and similar technologies is growing , the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses . we are exposed to risks , and may become exposed to additional risks , related to distributed ledger technology , including through our facilitation of clients ’ activities involving financial products that use distributed ledger technology , such as blockchain , cryptocurrencies or other digital assets , our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology , the use of distributed ledger technology by third - party vendors , clients , counterparties , clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries , and the receipt of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as collateral . market volatility of financial products using distributed ledger technology may increase these risks . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the development and use of artificial intelligence ( ai ) present risks and challenges that may adversely impact our business . we or our third - party vendors , clients or counterparties may develop or incorporate ai technology in certain business processes , services or products . the development and use of ai present a number of risks and challenges to our business . the legal and regulatory environment relating to ai is uncertain and rapidly evolving , both in the u.s . and internationally , and includes regulation targeted specifically at ai as well as provisions in intellectual property , privacy , consumer protection , employment and other laws applicable to the use of ai . these evolving laws and regulations could require changes in our implementation of ai technology and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non - compliance . ai models , particularly generative ai models , may produce output or take action that is incorrect , that result in the release of private , confidential or proprietary information , that reflect biases included in the data on which they are trained , infringe on the intellectual property rights of others , or that is otherwise harmful . in addition , the complexity of many ai models makes it challenging to understand why they are generating particular outputs . this limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of ai models , understanding and monitoring the capabilities of the ai models , reducing erroneous output , eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made . further , we may rely on ai models developed by third parties , and , to that extent , would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train their models , including risks arising from the inclusion of any unauthorized material in the training data for their models , and the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated with the output of their models , matters over which we may have limited visibility . any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures . in addition to our use of ai technologies , we are exposed to risks arising from the use of ai technologies by bad actors to commit fraud and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks . generative ai , if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks , could result in losses , liquidity outflows or other adverse effects at a particular financial institution or exchange . a failure to protect our computer systems , networks and information , and our clients ’ information , against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses , result in the disclosure , theft or destruction of confidential information , damage our reputation and cause losses . our operations rely on the secure processing , storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors . there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies , consumer - based companies , software and information technology service providers , governmental agencies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized access or disclosure of client , customer or other confidential information in recent years , as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination , theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets , as a result of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties , including actions by foreign governments . there have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ ransom ” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems . we are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks , including denial - of - service attacks , and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data . we have faced a high volume of cyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internet - based products and services , as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies , and as we provide these services to individual consumers . further , the use of ai by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third - party vendors and clients . the migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee - owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks , as do hybrid work arrangements . in addition , due to our interconnectivity with third - party vendors ( and their respective service providers ) , central agents , exchanges , clearinghouses and other financial institutions , we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event . these impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event or could result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client , customer or other confidential information , which could , in turn , interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information , we may not be able to anticipate , detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats , including because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated , change frequently and are often not recognized until launched . cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources , including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations . third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees , clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients , and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent . although we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant , our computer systems , software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access , misuse , computer viruses or other malicious code , cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact . risks relating to cyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the greater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers . due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems , the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues . in addition , protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into , and adversely affect our ability to respond to , cyber threats and issues with our systems . if one or more of these types of events occur , it potentially could jeopardize our , our clients ’ , our counterparties ’ or third parties ’ confidential and other information processed , stored in , or transmitted through our computer systems and networks , or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or those of our clients , counterparties or third parties , which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action , significant losses or reputational damage . in addition , such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being properly detected or escalated , and , following detection or escalation , it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent , amount and type of information compromised . during the course of an investigation , we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it , and actions , decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business , results of operations and reputation . moreover , new regulations require us to disclose information on a timely basis about material cybersecurity incidents , including those that may not have been resolved or fully investigated at the time of disclosure . we have expended , and expect to continue to expend , significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures , but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action , as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us . regulatory agencies have become increasingly focused on cybersecurity incidents . our clients ’ confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients ’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company . losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business , financial condition and results of operations . the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies heightens these and other operational risks , as do hybrid work arrangements . certain aspects of the security of these technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control , and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation , corruption or loss of confidential and other information . in addition , there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures , despite their sophistication , may be defeated , particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available . we routinely transmit and receive personal , confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means . we have discussed and worked with clients , vendors , service providers , counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks , but we do not have , and may be unable to put in place , secure capabilities with all of our clients , vendors , service providers , counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information . an interception , misuse or mishandling of personal , confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client , vendor , service provider , counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability , regulatory action and reputational harm . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and

techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes . thus , in the course of our activities , we have incurred and may in the future incur losses . market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk . the models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators . in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances , previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated , or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions . these types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses , and they may do so in the future . these changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours . in these and other cases , it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations , including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets . in addition , the use of models in connection with risk management and numerous other critical activities presents risks that the models may be ineffective , either because of poor design , ineffective testing , or improper or flawed inputs , as well as unpermitted access to the models resulting in unapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs . to the extent that we have positions through our market - making or origination activities or we make investments directly through our investing activities , including private equity , that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging , we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with those positions . in addition , to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation , we invest our own capital in private equity , credit , real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds , whether for legal , reputational or other reasons , may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments . prudent risk management , as well as regulatory restrictions , may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties , geographic areas or markets , which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities . our consumer offerings present us with different risks , and we have needed and continue to need to expand and adapt our risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities . a failure to adequately assess and control such risk exposures could result in losses to us . for further information about our risk management policies and procedures , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of

group , inc . and subsidiaries legal and regulatory our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world . as a participant in the financial services industry and a systemically important financial institution , we are subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world . we face the risk of significant intervention by law enforcement , regulatory and taxing authorities , as well as private litigation , in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses . in many cases , our activities have been and may continue to be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions . among other things , as a result of law enforcement authorities , regulators or private parties challenging our compliance with existing laws and regulations , we or our employees have been , and could be , fined , criminally charged or sanctioned ; prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities ; subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities , including higher capital requirements ; or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect to our employees . these limitations or conditions may limit our business activities and negatively impact our profitability . in addition to the impact on the scope and profitability of our business activities , day - to - day compliance with existing laws and regulations has involved and will continue to involve significant amounts of time , including that of our senior leaders and that of a large number of dedicated compliance and other reporting and operational personnel , in connection with which we expect to continue to add personnel , all of which may negatively impact our profitability . our revenues and profitability and those of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital , leverage , liquidity and long - term funding levels , requirements related to resolution and recovery planning , derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight , as well as limitations on which and , if permitted , how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions . the laws , regulations and accounting standards , that apply to our businesses are often complex and , in many cases , we must make interpretive decisions regarding the application of those laws , regulations and accounting standards to our business activities . changes in interpretations , whether in response to regulatory guidance , industry conventions , our own reassessments or otherwise , could adversely affect our businesses , results of operations or ability to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements , such as capital or liquidity requirements . if there are new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients , including capital , liquidity , leverage , long - term debt , total loss - absorbing capacity and margin requirements , restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices , reporting requirements , requirements relating to recovery and resolution planning , tax burdens and compensation restrictions , that are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions ( whether based on size , method of funding , activities , geography or other criteria ) , compliance with these new laws or regulations , or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations , could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way . in addition , regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally , such as taxes on stock transfers , share repurchases and other financial transactions , could adversely impact levels of market activity more broadly , and thus impact our businesses . changes to laws or regulations , such as tax laws , could also have a disproportionate impact on us , based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to financial services and financial firms or due to our corporate structure or where or how we provide these services . these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions , or even make it uneconomic for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in those jurisdictions , or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices , restructuring our businesses , moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other locations or complying with applicable capital requirements , including reducing dividends or share repurchases , liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries u.s . and non - u.s . regulatory developments , in particular the dodd - frank act and basel iii , have significantly altered the regulatory framework within which we operate and have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our profitability . among the aspects of the dodd - frank act that have affected or may in the future affect our businesses are : increased capital , liquidity and reporting requirements ; limitations on activities in which we may engage ; increased regulation of and restrictions on otc derivatives markets and transactions ; limitations on incentive compensation ; limitations on affiliate transactions ; requirements to reorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and resolution planning ; increased deposit insurance assessments ; and increased standards of care for broker - dealers and investment advisers in dealing with clients . the implementation of higher capital requirements , more stringent requirements relating to liquidity , long - term debt and total loss - absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of , or investment in , covered funds by the volcker rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position , particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions . the july [XXXX] proposal from the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies to implement the basel committee ’s finalization of the post - crisis regulatory capital reforms would raise our capital requirements , if adopted as proposed . we may also become subject to higher and more stringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result of the implementation of future basel committee standards . see "" business — regulation — banking supervision and regulation — risk - based capital ratios ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for further information about proposed regulatory requirements . as described in “ business — regulation — banking supervision and regulation — risk - based capital ratios ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k , the scb has replaced the capital conservation buffer under the standardized capital rules and resulted in higher standardized capital ratio requirements . failure to comply with these requirements could limit our ability to , among other things , repurchase shares , pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments . in addition , if we are required to resubmit our capital plan , we generally may not make capital distributions , such as share repurchases or dividends , without the prior approval of the frb . dividends and repurchases are also subject to oversight by the frb , which can result in limitations . limitations on our ability to make capital distributions could , among other things , prevent us from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our return on equity . additionally , as a g‑sib , we are subject to the g‑sib surcharge . our g‑sib surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year . expansion of our businesses , growth in our balance sheet and increased reliance on short - term wholesale funding have resulted in increases and in the future may result in further increases in our g‑sib surcharge and a corresponding increase in our capital requirements . the july [XXXX] proposal from the frb would introduce additional granularity in the surcharge buckets and increase the amount of financial data used in the calculation of the g - sib surcharge based on averages over the year , as opposed to period - end values , which could increase our g - sib surcharge . we are also subject to laws and regulations , such as the gdpr and the california consumer privacy act , relating to the privacy of the information of clients , employees or others , and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage . as new privacy - related laws and regulations are implemented , the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations , as well as our potential liability for non - compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches , may significantly increase . in addition , our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance , encryption and data on - shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate . compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies , procedures and technology for information security , which could , among other things , make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation , corruption or loss of information or technology . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our consumer - oriented deposit - taking and credit card businesses subject us to numerous additional regulations in the jurisdictions in which these businesses operate . not only are these regulations extensive , but they involve types of regulations and supervision , as well as regulatory compliance risks , that have not historically applied to us . the level of regulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting financial interactions with consumers is often much greater than that associated with doing business with institutions and high - net - worth individuals . complying with these regulations is time - consuming , costly and presents new and increased risks . our expansion into consumer - oriented activities resulted in a change to gs bank usa ’s cra requirements in [XXXX] , such that gs bank usa is no longer assessed as a “ wholesale bank ” for cra compliance purposes and , instead , is assessed pursuant to a strategic plan . any failure to comply with different or expanded cra requirements as a result of this change in assessment methods could negatively impact gs bank usa ’s cra ratings , cause reputational harm and result in limits on our ability to make future acquisitions or engage in certain new activities . increasingly , regulators and courts have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where they have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing , even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client . regulators and courts have also increasingly found liability as a “ control person ” for activities of entities in which financial institutions or funds controlled by financial institutions have an investment , but which they do not actively manage . in addition , regulators and courts continue to seek to establish “ fiduciary ” obligations to counterparties to which no such duty had been thought to exist . to the extent that such efforts are successful , the cost of , and liabilities associated with , engaging in brokerage , clearing , market - making , prime financing , investing and other similar activities could increase significantly . to the extent that we have fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for individual , institutional , sovereign or investment fund clients , any breach , or even an alleged breach , of such obligations could have materially negative legal , regulatory and reputational consequences . for information about the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject , see “ business — regulation ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. a failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses . due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base , we regularly address potential conflicts of interest , including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict , or are perceived to conflict , with the interests of that client or another client , as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non - public information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship . in addition , our status as a bhc subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the frb with respect to transactions between gs bank usa and its subsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and , under the volcker rule , transactions between us and covered funds . we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest , including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses . however , appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult , and our reputation , which is one of our most important assets , could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if we fail , or appear to fail , to identify , disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest . in addition , potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions . additionally , our one goldman sachs initiative , as well as the alignment of our businesses , aim to increase collaboration among our businesses , which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries we may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity . governmental scrutiny from regulators , legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to compensation , our business practices , our past actions and other matters remains at high levels . political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past resulted and may in the future result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage , as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government officials . press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing ( including , in some cases , press coverage and public statements that do not directly involve us ) often result in some type of investigation by regulators , legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits . responding to these investigations and lawsuits , regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding , is time - consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business . penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to support legislation targeted at the financial services industry . governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal or other actions , including seeking admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas , in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a company is viewed as having previously engaged in criminal , regulatory or other misconduct . adverse publicity , governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees , which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations . further , we are subject to regulatory settlements , orders and feedback that require significant remediation activities and enhancements to existing controls , systems and procedures , which has required and will require us to commit significant resources , including hiring , as well as testing the operation and effectiveness of new controls , policies and procedures . the failure to complete these remediation activities in a timely manner could lead to higher operating expenses , reputational damage and other negative consequences . the financial services industry generally and our businesses in particular have been subject to negative publicity . our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel , whether or not accurate or true , that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations . postings on these types of forums may also adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other parties that owe us money , securities or other assets and increase the chance that they will not perform their obligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their use of our services . the speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels , in particular social media , may magnify risks relating to negative publicity . the rapid dissemination of negative information through social media , in part , is believed to have led to the collapse of silicon valley bank ( svb ) . svb suffered a level of deposit withdrawals within a time period not previously experienced by a financial institution . we could also be subject to rapid deposit withdrawals or other outflows as a result of negative social media posts or other negative publicity . substantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm , which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects . we face significant legal risks in our businesses , and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high . see notes [XX] and [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k for information about certain of our legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations . we have seen legal claims by consumers and clients increase in a market downturn and employment - related claims increase following periods in which we have reduced our headcount . additionally , governmental entities have been plaintiffs and are parties in certain of our legal proceedings , and we may face future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or other governmental entities , as well as follow - on civil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlements . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries significant settlements by large financial institutions , including , in some cases , us , with governmental entities have become common . the trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions , including , in some cases , us , in similar actions , especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements . the uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses , which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties . claims of collusion or anti - competitive conduct have become more common . financial institutions ( including us ) have been subject to civil cases and investigatory demands relating to alleged bid - rigging , group boycotts or other anti - competitive practices . antitrust laws generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damages . these claims have resulted in significant settlements and fines in the past and may do so in the future . we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide , including the fcpa and the u.k . bribery act , relating to corrupt and illegal payments to , and hiring practices with regard to , government officials and others . violation of these or similar laws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalties . such violations could also result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation . certain law enforcement authorities have recently required admissions of wrongdoing , and , in some cases , criminal pleas , as part of the resolutions of matters brought against financial institutions or their employees . see for example , “ 1mdb - related matters ” in note [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation , could adversely affect our reputation , could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects . further , as a result of this type of settlement , we are no longer a “ well - known seasoned issuer , ” which places limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities . in conducting our businesses around the world , we are subject to political , legal , regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries . in conducting our businesses and supporting our global operations , we are subject to risks of possible nationalization , expropriation , price controls , capital controls , exchange controls , communications and other content restrictions , and other restrictive governmental actions . for example , sanctions have been imposed by the u.s . and the e.u . on certain individuals and companies in russia and venezuela . in many countries , the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the transactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving , and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market . we have been in some cases subject to divergent and conflicting laws and regulations across markets , and we are increasingly subject to the risk that the jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or may implement laws and regulations that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction . any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market , but also on our reputation generally . further , in some jurisdictions a failure , or alleged failure , to comply with laws and regulations has subjected and may in the future subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions , but also criminal actions and other sanctions . we are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases . while business and other practices throughout the world differ , our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments , hiring practices and money laundering , as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals , groups and countries , such as the fcpa , the bsa and the u.k . bribery act . while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring , the geographical diversity of our operations , employees , clients and consumers , as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with , greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation . see for example , “ 1mdb - related matters ” in note [XX] to the consolidated financial statements in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k. # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries in addition , there have been a number of highly publicized cases around the world , involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry , and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct . this misconduct has included and may also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies , rules or procedures or misappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary information , including proprietary software . it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all cases , as reflected by the settlements relating to 1mdb . the application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the u.s . and in non - u.s . jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for group inc . ’s security holders . as described in “ business — regulation — banking supervision and regulation — insolvency of an idi or a bhc , ” if the fdic is appointed as receiver under ola , the rights of group inc . ’s creditors would be determined under ola , and substantial differences exist in the rights of creditors between ola and the u.s . bankruptcy code , including the right of the fdic under ola to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances , which could have a material adverse effect on our debtholders . the fdic has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under ola to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that would , among other things , impose losses on shareholders , debtholders and other creditors of the top - tier bhc ( in our case , group inc . ) , while the bhc ’s subsidiaries may continue to operate . it is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under ola , in which group inc . would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings ( and its material broker - dealer , bank and other operating entities would not enter resolution proceedings ) , would result in greater losses to group inc . ’s security holders ( including holders of our fixed rate , floating rate and indexed debt securities ) , than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy , such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for group inc . and certain of its material subsidiaries . assuming group inc . entered resolution proceedings and support from group inc . or other resources available to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent , losses at the subsidiary level would be transferred to group inc . and ultimately borne by group inc . ’s security holders , third - party creditors of group inc . ’s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims , and group inc . ’s security holders ( including our shareholders , debtholders and other unsecured creditors ) could face significant and possibly complete losses . in that case , group inc . ’s security holders would face losses while the third - party creditors of group inc . ’s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings . in addition , holders of group inc . ’s eligible long - term debt and holders of group inc . ’s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under ola if the fdic exercised its right , described above , to disregard the priority of creditor claims . ola also provides the fdic with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses , and amounts owed to the u.s . government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors , including senior creditors . in addition , under ola , claims of creditors ( including debtholders ) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which group inc . ’s assets are transferred . if such a securities - for - claims exchange were implemented , there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged . while the fdic has issued regulations to implement ola , not all aspects of how the fdic might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries in addition , certain jurisdictions , including the u.k . and the e.u . , have implemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity . such “ bail - in ” powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders . for example , the bank of england requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material u.k . subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the bank of england to exercise such “ bail - in ” powers in certain circumstances . if the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is “ bailed in , ” group inc . ’s claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries ’ third - party creditors or written down . u.s . regulators are considering and non - u.s . authorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss - absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the top - tier bhc and , ultimately , to security holders of the top - tier bhc in the event of failure . the application of group inc . ’s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for group inc . ’s security holders . in our resolution plan , group inc . would be resolved under the u.s . bankruptcy code . the strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy : group inc . and goldman sachs funding llc ( funding ihc ) , a wholly - owned , direct subsidiary of group inc . , would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries , including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness , the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans . if this strategy were successful , creditors of some or all of group inc . ’s major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims , while group inc . ’s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses . to facilitate the execution of our resolution plan , we formed funding ihc . in exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest , group inc . transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its gcla to funding ihc , and agreed to transfer additional gcla above prescribed thresholds . we also put in place a capital and liquidity support agreement ( clsa ) among group inc . , funding ihc and our major subsidiaries . under the clsa , funding ihc has provided group inc . with a committed line of credit that allows group inc . to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business . in addition , if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent , ( i ) the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven , ( ii ) all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to group inc . will be transferred to funding ihc or their maturities will be extended to five years , ( iii ) group inc . will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and gcla ( other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses ) to funding ihc , and ( iv ) funding ihc will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries . group inc . ’s and funding ihc ’s obligations under the clsa are secured pursuant to a related security agreement . such actions would materially and adversely affect group inc . ’s liquidity . as a result , during a period of severe stress , group inc . might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the clsa and related security agreement had not been implemented . if group inc . ’s proposed resolution strategy were successful , group inc . ’s security holders could face losses while the third - party creditors of group inc . ’s major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings . as part of the strategy , group inc . could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries ’ derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross - default and early termination rights would be stayed under the isda protocols , as applicable , which would result in holders of group inc . ’s eligible long - term debt and holders of group inc . ’s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations . it is also possible that holders of group inc . ’s eligible long - term debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of group inc . ’s major subsidiaries . if group inc . ’s proposed resolution strategy were not successful , group inc . ’s financial condition would be adversely impacted and group inc . ’s security holders , including debtholders , may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented . in all cases , any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman

or other costs and face limitations on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient . our commodities activities , particularly our physical commodities activities , subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks , including environmental , reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs . as part of our commodities business , we purchase and sell certain physical commodities , arrange for their

electric power , agricultural products , metals ( base and precious ) , minerals ( including unenriched uranium ) , emission credits , coal , freight and related products and indices . we make investments in and finance entities that engage in the production , storage and transportation of numerous commodities , including many of the commodities referenced above . these activities subject us and/or the entities in which we invest to extensive and evolving federal , state and local energy , environmental , antitrust and other governmental laws and regulations worldwide , including environmental laws and regulations relating to , among others , air quality , water quality , waste management , transportation of hazardous substances , natural resources , site remediation and health and safety . additionally , rising climate change concerns have led to additional regulation , regulatory scrutiny and disclosure obligations that have increased and could further increase the operating costs and could adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments and activities . there may be substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commodities - related activities and investments . compliance with these laws and regulations requires significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring , renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels , payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes , and application for , and holding of , permits and licenses . commodities involved in our intermediation activities and investments are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events , which are likely to be outside of our control , including those arising from the breakdown or failure of transport vessels , storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions , fires , leaks , spills or release of hazardous substances , performance below expected levels of output or efficiency , terrorist attacks , extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events . in addition , we rely on third - party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part , including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store commodities , could expose us to costs or losses . also , while we seek to insure against potential risks , we do not have insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses . the occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients , may impair our operations or financial results and may

goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries competition our results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base . our client base is not the same as that of our major competitors . our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors . therefore , unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets . for example , our market - making businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than some of our competitors and such clients have in the past been and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility . correspondingly , favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market . for example , we have a smaller corporate client base in our market - making businesses than some of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients . similarly , we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions , which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution . the financial services industry is highly competitive . the financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive , and we expect them to remain so . we compete on the basis of a number of factors , including transaction execution , our products and services , innovation , reputation , creditworthiness and price . there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry . this has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets . as a result , we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions . as we have expanded into new business areas and new geographic regions , we have faced competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients , regulators and industry participants in the relevant market , which could adversely affect our ability to expand our businesses . governments and regulators have adopted regulations , imposed taxes , adopted compensation restrictions or otherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost - effective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions , including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage . these or other similar rules , many of which do not apply to all our u.s . or non - u.s . competitors , could impact our ability to compete effectively . pricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase , particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices . for example , in connection with investment banking and other assignments , in response to competitive pressure we have experienced , we have extended and priced credit at levels that in some cases have not fully compensated us for the risks we undertook . the financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry . many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions , and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions . this has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices , including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated . while we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and prevent such activities , they may not be effective . allegations of such activities , particularly by regulators , can have a negative reputational impact and can subject us to large fines and settlements , and potentially significant penalties , including treble damages . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies , including trading and distributed ledger technologies , including cryptocurrencies , has increased competition . technology is fundamental to our business and our industry . the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges . securities , futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically , both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems , and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue . some of these alternative trading systems compete with us , particularly our exchange - based market - making activities , and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas . in addition , the increased use by our clients of low - cost electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets has caused and could continue to cause a reduction in commissions and spreads . as our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets , we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure . we have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so , but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return , particularly given the generally lower commissions arising from electronic trades . in addition , the emergence , adoption and evolution of new technologies , including distributed ledgers , such as digital assets and blockchain , and ai , have required us to invest resources to adapt our existing products and services , and we expect to continue to make such investments , which could be material . the adoption and evolution of such new technologies may also increase our compliance and regulatory costs . further , technologies , such as those based on distributed ledgers , that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payments processing and other financial services . regulatory limitations on our involvement in products and platforms involving digital assets and distributed ledger technologies may not apply equally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors . we may not be as timely or successful in developing or integrating , or even able to develop or integrate , new products and technologies , such as those built on distributed ledgers or ai technologies , into our existing products and services , adapting to changes in client preferences or achieving market acceptance of our products and services , any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain clients , cause us to lose market share or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us . our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees . our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people ; therefore , our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses , to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees . factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits , and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring , training and promoting qualified employees . as a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of year - end discretionary compensation , a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity - related awards , declines in our profitability , or in the outlook for our future profitability , as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms , can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees . competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry , including the technology industry , for qualified employees has often been intense . we have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of our consumer - oriented businesses and our technology initiatives . this is also the case in emerging and growth markets , where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region . laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees ’ income or the amount or composition of compensation , or that require us to disclose our or our competitors ’ compensation practices , may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions . as described further in “ business — regulation — compensation practices ” in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k , our compensation practices are subject to review by , and the standards of , the frb . as a large global financial and banking institution , we are subject to limitations on compensation practices ( which may or may not affect the companies with which we compete for talent ) by the frb , the pra , the fca , the fdic and other regulators worldwide . these limitations have shaped our compensation practices , which has , in some cases , adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employees , in particular in relation to companies not subject to these limitations , and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend , in part , on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employees located in strategic locations . our future human capital resource requirements and the benefits provided by strategic locations are uncertain , and we may not realize the benefits we anticipate . market developments and general business environment our businesses , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by unforeseen or catastrophic events , including pandemics , terrorist attacks , wars , extreme weather events or other natural disasters . the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events , including pandemics or other widespread health emergencies ( or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency ) , terrorist attacks , wars , extreme weather events , solar events or other natural disasters , could adversely affect our business , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations . these events could have such effects through economic or financial market disruptions or challenging economic or market conditions more generally , the deterioration of our creditworthiness or that of our counterparties , changes in consumer sentiment and consumer borrowing , spending and savings patterns , liquidity stress , or operational difficulties ( such as travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in our offices ) that impair our ability to manage our businesses . climate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties , and our actual or perceived action or inaction relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation . climate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary locations , which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients , adversely affect the value of our investments , including our real estate investments , and reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance . climate change and the transition to a less carbon - dependent economy may also have a negative impact on the operations or financial condition of our clients and counterparties , which may decrease revenues from those clients and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients and counterparties . in addition , climate change may impact the broader economy . we are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in public policy , laws and regulations , or market and public perceptions and preferences in connection with the transition to a less carbon - dependent economy . these changes could adversely affect our business , results of operations and reputation . for example , our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our or our clients ’ involvement in , or decision not to participate in , certain industries or projects perceived to be associated with causing or exacerbating climate change , as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change . if we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective , insufficient or otherwise inappropriate , our business , reputation and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer . new regulations or guidance relating to climate change , as well as the perspectives of government officials , regulators , shareholders , employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change , may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products . federal and state , and non - u.s . banking regulators and supervisory authorities , shareholders and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address risks related to climate change , both directly and with respect to their clients , which may result in financial institutions coming under increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending , investment and advisory activities . for example , in [XXXX] we participated in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise conducted by the frb . we are also subject to interagency guidance jointly issued by the frb , fdic , and occ in october [XXXX] regarding principles for climate - related financial risk management for large financial institutions . in addition , in december [XXXX] , the nydfs issued proposed guidance on the management of material financial risks from climate change , which would apply to new york state - regulated banking and mortgage institutions , including gs bank usa . in the e.u . , the csrd will become effective beginning with year - end [XXXX] reporting . the csrd expands the scope of esg disclosure required under e.u . rules . these regulations , guidance and expectations , as well as any additional or heightened requirements , could result in increased regulatory , compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements . the risks associated with , and the perspective of regulators , shareholders , employees and other stakeholders regarding , climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly , which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate change - related risks and uncertainties , but we expect that climate change - related risks will increase over time . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our business , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations have been adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by conflicts , and related sanctions and other developments . the conflict between russia and ukraine has negatively affected the global economy . governments around the world have responded to russia ’s invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on certain industry sectors , including price caps on russian oil , and on russian businesses and persons . compliance with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has increased our costs and otherwise adversely affected our business and may continue to do so . russia has responded with its own restrictions against investors and countries outside russia and has proposed additional measures aimed at non - russian owned businesses . businesses in the u.s . and globally have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation , energy , and raw materials due in part to the negative effects of the conflict on the global economy . the conflicts in the middle east could also affect and harm our business and increase market uncertainty . the impact of these conflicts on our business and operations is uncertain and therefore can not be predicted . the escalation or continuation of these conflicts or other hostilities could result in , among other things , an increased risk of cyber attacks , an increased frequency and volume of failures to settle securities transactions , supply chain disruptions , higher inflation , lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity , currency and other financial markets . the extent and duration of the conflicts , sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict , and the consequences for our business could be significant . if international political instability and geopolitical tensions continue or increase in any region in which we do business , our business and results of operations could be harmed . see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk management — credit risk management — selected exposures — country exposures ” for further information about our credit exposure to russia and ukraine . certain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in reference rates , currencies , indexes , baskets or etfs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked . many of the products that we own or that we offer , such as structured notes , warrants , swaps or security - based swaps , pay interest or determine the principal amount to be paid at maturity or in the event of default by reference to rates or by reference to an index , currency , basket , etf or other financial metric ( the underlier ) . in the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed , by reference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise , the underlier ceases to exist ( for example , in the event that a country withdraws from the euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark , an index or etf sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or etf , or stocks in a basket are delisted or become impermissible to be included in the index or etf ) , the underlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark or there are legal or regulatory constraints on linking a financial instrument to the underlier , we may experience adverse effects . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries our business ,

escalating tensions between the u.s . and china have resulted in and may result in additional changes to u.s . international trade and investment policies , which could disrupt international trade and investment , adversely affect financial markets , including market activity levels , and adversely impact our revenues . continued or escalating tensions may also lead to the u.s . , china or other countries taking other actions , which could include the implementation of sanctions , tariffs or foreign exchange measures , the large - scale sale of u.s . treasury securities or restrictions on cross - border trade , investment or transfer of information or technology . any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients ’ businesses , as well as our financial condition , liquidity and results of operations , possibly materially . a conflict , or concerns about a potential conflict , involving china and taiwan , the u.s . or other countries could negatively impact financial markets and our or our clients ’ businesses . trade restrictions by the u.s . or other countries in response to a conflict or potential conflict involving china , including financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain organizations or individuals , or actions taken by china in response to trade restrictions , could negatively impact our or our clients ’ ability to conduct business in certain countries or with certain counterparties and could negatively impact regional and global financial markets and economic conditions . any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business , financial condition , liquidity and results of operations , possibly materially . we face enhanced risks as we operate in new locations and transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties . our businesses , have in the past , and may in the future , bring us into contact , directly or indirectly , with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base , expose us to new asset classes and new markets , and present us with integration challenges . for example , we continue to transact business and invest in new regions , including a wide range of emerging and growth markets , and we expect this trend to continue . various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions , including significant devaluations of their currencies , defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt , capital and currency exchange controls , and low or negative growth rates in their economies . the possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally . furthermore , in a number of our businesses , including where we make markets , invest and lend , we own interests in , or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of , public services , such as airports , toll roads and shipping ports , as well as physical commodities and commodities infrastructure components , both within and outside the u.s . in our consumer - oriented activities , we have faced and continue to face , additional compliance , legal and regulatory risk , increased reputational risk and increased operational risk due to , among other things , higher transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer and client information . we are also subject to additional legal requirements , including with respect to suitability and consumer protection ( for example , regulation best interest , fair lending laws and regulations and privacy laws and regulations ) . further , identity fraud may increase and credit reporting practices may change in a manner that makes it more difficult for financial institutions , such as us , to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers . we have increased and intend to further increase our transaction banking activities . as a result , we face additional compliance , legal and regulatory risk , including with respect to know - your - customer , anti - money laundering and reporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers of property belonging to countries , entities and individuals subject to sanctions by u.s . or other governmental authorities . we are making significant enhancements to existing controls , systems and procedures to manage these risks . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the goldman sachs group , inc . and subsidiaries new

clients , business partners , counterparties and investors , greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities , increased credit - related , market , sovereign and operational risks , risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism , and reputational concerns with the manner in which certain assets are being operated or held or in which we interact with these clients , business partners , counterparties and investors . legal , regulatory and reputational risks may also exist in connection with activities and transactions involving new products or markets where there is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or conflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction involved , particularly where transactions in such products may involve multiple jurisdictions . we have developed and pursued new business and strategic initiatives , including acquisitions , and may continue to do so . if and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiatives , we may incur unanticipated costs and losses , and face other adverse consequences , such as negative reputational effects . in addition , the actual effects of pursuing those initiatives may differ , possibly materially , from the benefits that we expect to realize from them , such as generating additional revenues , achieving expense savings , reducing operational risk exposures or using capital and funding more efficiently . engaging in new activities exposes us to a variety of risks , including that we may be unable to successfully develop new , competitive , efficient and effective systems and processes , and hire and retain the necessary personnel . due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured consumer lending , our loan loss assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business or in expanding the product offerings for the business . in recent years , we have invested , and may continue to invest , more in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues . such investments and acquisitions may not be successful or have returns similar to our other businesses . we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from acquisitions or other business initiatives in the time frames we expect , or at all . we have engaged in selective acquisitions and may continue to do so in the future and these acquisitions may , individually or in the aggregate , be material to us . any future acquisitions could involve the issuance of common stock and/or the payment of cash as consideration . the success of our acquisitions will depend , in part , on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated synergies , cost savings and growth opportunities . for example , in the fourth quarter of [XXXX] , we entered into an agreement to sell greensky and sold pfm , both of which we had previously acquired , and in connection with the greensky disposition incurred a write - down of intangible assets and goodwill . we may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems , including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients , counterparties , regulators and others in connection with acquisitions . integration of acquired businesses is time - consuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses , produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties , cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial , management and other resources . it is also possible that an acquisition , once announced , may not close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closing conditions , such as the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals . there is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be successfully integrated or yield all of the expected benefits and synergies in the time frames that we expect , or at all . if we are not able to integrate our acquisitions successfully , our results of operations , financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected . # # table_start goldman sachs [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end the goldman sachs

term investment performance , innovation , execution , relative pricing and other factors , including entering into new or expanding current businesses as a result of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives . our ability to sustain or improve our competitive position also depends substantially on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs . we compete with commercial banks , investment banking firms , brokerage firms , insurance companies , exchanges , electronic trading and clearing platforms , financial data repositories , investment advisers and sponsors of mutual funds , hedge funds , real assets funds and private credit and equity funds , energy companies , financial technology firms and other companies offering financial and ancillary services in the u.s . and globally , including , in certain instances , through the internet . in addition , restrictive laws and regulations applicable to certain global financial services institutions , which have been increasing in complexity and volume , may prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions , impose more stringent capital and liquidity requirements , and increase costs , and can put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors in certain businesses not subject to these same requirements . see also “ supervision and regulation ” herein and “ risk factors . ” we compete directly in the u.s . and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker -

forward - looking statements ” preceding “ business ” and “ return on tangible common equity goal ” in “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . ” market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices , rates , spreads , indices , volatilities , correlations or other market factors , such as market liquidity , will result in losses for a position or portfolio . we have direct exposure to market risk . in addition , market risk may also impact our clients and markets in a manner that may indirectly impact us . for more information on how we monitor and manage market risk , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — market risk . ” our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global financial market and economic conditions and other factors . our results of operations have been in the past and may , in the future , be materially affected by global financial market and economic conditions , including in particular by periods of low or slowing economic growth in the united states and other major markets , both directly and indirectly through their impact on client activity levels . these include the level and volatility of equity , fixed income and commodity prices ; the level , term structure and volatility of interest rates ; inflation and currency values ; the level of other market indices , fiscal or monetary policies established by central banks and financial regulators ; and uncertainty concerning the future path of interest rates , government shutdowns , debt ceilings or funding , which may be driven by economic conditions , recessionary fears , market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and clients due to the effects of widespread events such as global pandemics , natural disasters , climate - related incidents , acts of war or aggression , geopolitical instability , changes in u.s . presidential administrations or congress , changes to global trade policies , supply chain complications and the implementation of tariffs or protectionist trade policies and other factors , or a combination of these or other factors . the results of our institutional securities business segment , particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products , are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we can not control or predict with great certainty . these fluctuations impact results by causing variations in business flows and activity and in the fair value of securities and other financial products . fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity , which , among other things , can be impacted by market uncertainty or lack of investor and client confidence due to unforeseen economic , geopolitical or market conditions that in turn affect the size , number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments . periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions , including equity market levels and the level and pace of changes in interest rates and asset valuation , may have adverse impacts on the level of individual investor confidence and participation in the global markets and/or the level of and mix of client assets , including deposits , which would negatively impact the results of our wealth management business segment . substantial market fluctuations could also cause variations in the value of our investments in our funds , the flow of investment capital into or from aum , and the way customers allocate capital among money market , equity , fixed income or other investment alternatives , which could negatively impact the results of our investment management business segment . the value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations . market volatility , illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the markets may make it difficult to value and monetize certain of our financial instruments , particularly during periods of market uncertainty or displacement . subsequent valuations in future periods , in light of factors then prevailing , may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective fees and performance - based income ( also known as incentive fees , which include carried interest ) in respect of certain businesses . in addition , at the time of any sales and settlements of these financial instruments , the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value . any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments , which may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods . in addition , financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity . under these extreme conditions , hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions . moreover , under these conditions , market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale , which could lead to increased individual counterparty risk for our businesses . although our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves , severe market events have historically been difficult to predict , and we could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur . # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses . concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market - making , investing , underwriting ( including block trading ) and lending businesses ( including margin lending ) in the event of unfavorable market movements . we commit substantial amounts of capital to these businesses , which often results in our taking large positions in the securities of , or making large loans to , a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry , country or region . in the event we hold a concentrated position larger than those held by competitors , we may incur larger losses . for further information regarding our country risk exposure , see also “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — country risks . ” credit risk credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower , counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us . for more information on how we monitor and manage credit risk , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — credit risk . ” we are exposed to the risk that third parties that are indebted to us will not perform their obligations . we incur significant credit risk exposure through our institutional securities business segment . this risk may arise from a variety of business activities , including , but not limited to : extending credit to clients through various lending commitments ; entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us ; acting as clearing broker for listed and over - the - counter derivatives whereby we guarantee client performance to clearinghouses ; providing short- or long - term funding that is secured by physical or financial collater al , including , but not limited to , real estate and marketable securities , whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount ; posting margin and/or collateral and other commitments to clearinghouses , clearing agencies , exchanges , banks , securities firms and other financial counterparties ; and investing and trading in securities and loan pools , whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans . we also incur credit risk in our wealth management business segment lending to mainly individual investors , including , but not limited to , margin- and securities - based loans colla teralized by securities , residential mortgage loans , including home equity lines of credit ( “ helocs ” ) , and structured loans to ultra - high net worth clients , that are in most cases secured by various types of collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount , including marketable securities , private investments , commercial real estate and other financial assets . our valuations related to , and reserves for losses on , credit exposures rely on complex models , estimates and subjective judgments about the future . while we believe current valuations and reserves adequately address our perceived levels of risk , future economic conditions , including inflation and changes in real estate and other asset values , tha t differ from or are more severe than forecast , inaccurate models or assumptions , or external factors such as global pandemics , natural disasters , or geopolitical events , could lead to inaccurate measurement of or deterioration of credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or the value of collateral and result in unexpected losses . we may also incur higher - than - anticipated credit losses as a result of ( i ) disputes with counterparties over the valuation of collateral or ( ii ) actions taken by other lenders that may negatively impact the valuation of collateral . in cases where we foreclose on collateral , sudden declines in the value or liquidity of collateral may result in significant losses to us despite our ( i ) credit monitoring , ( ii ) over - collateralization , ( iii ) ability to call for additional collateral or ( iv ) ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation , especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation . in addition , in the longer term , climate change may have a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients , which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients . certain of our credit exposures may be concentrated by counterparty , pr oduct , sector , portfolio , industry or geographic region . although our models and estimates account for correlations among related types of exposures , a change in the market or economic environment for a concentrated product or an external factor impacting a concentrated counterparty , sector , portfolio , industry or geographic region may result in credit losses in excess of amounts forecast . for further information regarding our country risk exposure , see also “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — country risks . ” in addition , as a clearing member of several central counterparties , we are responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers and could incur financial losses in the event of default by other clearing members . although we regularly review our credit exposures , default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee . a default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets . the commercial soundness of many financial institutions and certain other large financial services firms may be closely interrelated as a result of credit , trading , clearing or other relationships among such entities . increased centralization of trading activities through particular clearinghouses , central agents or exchanges may increase our concentration of risk with respect to these entities . as a result , concerns about , or a default or threatened default by , one or more such entities could lead to significant market - wide liquidity and credit problems , losses or defaults by other institutions , or require # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end financial commitments to multi - lateral actions intended to support market stability . this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries , such as clearinghouses , clearing agencies , exchanges , banks and securities firms , with which we interact on a daily basis and , therefore , could adversely affect us . see also “ systemic risk regime ” under “ business — supervision and regulation — financial holding company . ” operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss , or of damage to our reputation , resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems , from human factors ( e.g. , inappropriate or unlawful conduct ) or from external events ( e.g . , cyberattacks or third - party vulnerabilities ) that may manifest as , for example , loss of information , business disruption , theft and fraud , legal , regulatory and compliance risks , or damage to physical assets . we may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities , including revenue - generating activities and support and control groups ( e.g . , information technology ( "" it "" ) and trade processing ) . legal , regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under “ legal , regulatory and compliance risk . ” for more information on how we monitor and manage operational risk , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — operational risk . ” we are subject to operational risks , including a failure , breach or other disruption of our operations or security systems or those of our third parties ( or third parties thereof ) , as well as human error or malfeasance , which could adversely affect our businesses or reputation . our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report , on a daily basis , a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies . we may introduce new products or services or change processes or reporting , including in connection with new regulatory requirements , or integration of processes or systems of acquired companies , resulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate or identify . the trend toward direct access to automated , electronic markets and the move to more automated trading platforms has resulted in the use of increasingly complex technology that relies on the continued effectiveness of the programming code and integrity of the data to process the trades . we rely on the ability of our employees , our consultants , our internal systems and systems at technology centers maintained by unaffiliated third parties to operate our different businesses and process a high volume of transactions . unusually high trading volumes or site usage could cause our systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail . disruptions to , destruction of , instability of or other failure to effectively maintain our it systems or external technology that allows our clients and customers to use our products and services ( including our self - directed brokerage platform ) could harm our business and our reputation . as a major participant in the global capital markets , we face the risk of incorrect valuation or risk management of our trading positions due to flaws in data , models , electronic trading systems or processes , or due to fraud or cyberattack . we also face the risk of operational failure or disruption of any of the clearing agents , exchanges , clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our lending , securities and derivatives transactions . in addition , in the event of a breakdown or improper operation or disposal of our or a direct or indirect third party ’s systems ( or third parties thereof ) , processes or information assets , or improper or unauthorized action by third parties , including consultants and subcontractors or our employees , we have received in the past and may receive in the future regulatory sanctions , and could suffer financial loss , an impairment to our liquidity position , a disruption of our businesses or damage to our reputation . in addition , the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents , exchanges and clearinghouses , and the increased importance of these entities , increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business . furthermore , the concentration of firm and personal information held by a small number of third parties increases the risk that a breach or disruption at a key third party may cause an industrywide event that could significantly increase the cost and risk of conducting business . these risks may be heightened to the extent that we rely on third parties that are concentrated in a geographic area . there can be no assurance that our business contingency and security response plans fully mitigate all potential risks to us . our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located . this may include a disruption involving physical site access ; software flaws and vulnerabilities ; cybersecurity incidents ; terrorist activities ; political unrest ; disease pandemics ; catastrophic events ; climate - related incidents and natural disasters ( such as earthquakes , tornadoes , floods , hurricanes and wildfires ) ; electrical outages ; environmental hazards ; computer servers ; communication platforms or other services we use ; new technologies ( such as generative artificial intelligence ) ; and our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business . although we employ backup systems for our data , those backup systems may be unavailable following a disruption , the affected data may not have been backed up or may not be recoverable from the backup , or the backup data may be costly to recover , which could adversely affect our business . notwithstanding evolving technology and technology - based risk and control systems , our businesses ultimately rely on people , including our employees and those of third parties with whom we conduct business . as a result of human error or engagement in violations of applicable policies , laws , rules or procedures , certain errors or violations are not always discovered immediately by our technological processes or by # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end our controls and other procedures that are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations . these can include calculation or input errors , inadvertent or duplicate payments , mistakes in addressing emails or other communications , errors in software or model development or implementation , or errors in judgment , as well as intentional efforts to disregard or circumvent applicable policies , laws , rules or procedures . our use of new technologies may be undermined by such human errors or misconduct due to undetected flaws or biases in the algorithms or data utilized by such technologies . human errors and malfeasance , even if promptly discovered and remediated , can result in material losses and liabilities for us , and negatively impact our reputation in the future . we conduct business in various jurisdictions outside the u.s . , including jurisdictions that may not have comparable levels of protection for their corporate assets , such as intellectual property , trademarks , trade secrets , know - how , and customer information and records . the protection afforded in those jurisdictions may be less established and/or predictable than in the u.s . or other jurisdictions in which we operate . as a result , there may also be heightened risks associated with the potential theft of their data , technology and intellectual property in those jurisdictions by domestic or foreign actors , including private parties and those affiliated with or controlled by state actors . additionally , we are subject to complex and evolving u.s . and international laws and regulations governing cybersecurity , privacy and data governance , transfer and protection , which may differ and potentially conflict , in various jurisdictions . any theft of data , technology or intellectual property may negatively impact our operations and reputation , including disrupting the business activities of our subsidiaries , affiliates , joint ventures or clients conducting business in those jurisdictions . a cyberattack , information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or manage our exposure to risk , or result in disclosure or misuse of personal , confidential or proprietary information and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations , liquidity and financial condition , as well as cause reputational harm . cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies ; the use of the internet , mobile telecommunications and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions ; and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime , hackers , terrorists , nation - states , state - sponsored actors and other parties . any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees , customers , clients , vendors or other third parties or users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our networks , systems or data or those of our employees or clients , and such parties may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence . global events and geopolitical instability have also led to increased nation - state targeting of financial institutions in the u.s . and abroad . information security risks may also derive from human error , fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties , software bugs , server malfunctions , software or hardware failure or other technological failure . for example , human error has led to the loss of the firm 's physical data - bearing devices in the past . these risks may be heightened by several factors , including remote work , reliance on new technologies ( such as generative artificial intelligence ) or as a result of the integration of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives that may subject us to new technology , customers or third - party providers . in addition , third parties with whom we do business or share information , and each of their service providers , our regulators and the third parties with whom our customers and clients share information used for authentication , may also be sources of cybersecurity and information security risks , particularly where activities of customers are beyond our security and control systems . there is no guarantee that the measures we take will provide absolute security or recoverability given that the techniques used in cyberattacks are complex , frequently change and are difficult to anticipate . like other financial services firms , the firm , its third - party providers and its clients continue to be the subject of unauthorized access attacks ; mishandling , loss , theft or misuse of information ; computer viruses or malware ; cyberattacks designed to obtain confidential information , destroy data , disrupt or degrade service , sabotage systems or networks or cause other damage ; ransomware ; denial of service attacks ; data breaches ; social engineering attacks ; phishing attacks ; and other events . there can be no assurance that such unauthorized access , mishandling or misuse of information , or cybersecurity incidents will not occur in the future and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale . we maintain a significant amount of personal and confidential information on our customers , clients and certain counterparties that we are required to protect under various state , federal and international data protection and privacy laws . these laws may be in conflict with one another or courts and regulators may interpret them in ways that we had not anticipated or that adversely affect our business . a cyberattack , information or security breach , or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could jeopardize our or our clients ’ , employees ’ , partners ’ , vendors ’ or counterparties ’ personal , confidential , proprietary or other information processed and stored in , and transmitted through , our and our third parties ’ computer systems and networks . furthermore , such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our , our clients ’ , employees ’ , partners ’ , vendors ’ , counterparties ’ or third parties ’ operations , as well as the unauthorized release , gathering , monitoring , misuse , loss or destruction of personal , confidential , proprietary and other information of ours , our employees , our customers or of other third parties . any of these events could result in reputational damage with # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end our clients and the market , client dissatisfaction , additional costs to us to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure , violation of the applicable data protection and privacy laws , regulatory investigations and enforcement actions , litigation exposure , or fines or penalties , any of which could adversely affect our business , financial condition or results of operations . given our global footprint and the high volume of transactions we process ; the large number of clients , partners , vendors and counterparties with which we do business ; and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks , a cyberattack or information or security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection . it could take considerable time for us to determine the scope , extent , amount and type of information compromised , and the impact of such an attack may not be fully understood . during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it , and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated , if at all , all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack or information security incident . while many of our agreements with partners and third - party vendors include indemnification provisions , we may not be able to recover sufficiently , or at all , under such provisions to adequately offset any losses we may incur . in addition , although we maintain insurance coverage that may , subject to policy terms and conditions , cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks , such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any or all losses we may incur , and we can not be sure that such insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms , or at all , or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim . we continue to make investments with a view toward maintaining and enhancing our cybersecurity , resilience and information security posture , including investments in technology and associated technology risk management activities . the cost of managing cybersecurity and information security risks and attacks along with complying with new , increasingly expansive and evolving regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and business . liquidity risk liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets . liquidity risk also encompasses our ability ( or perceived ability ) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern , as well as the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding . for more information on how we monitor and manage liquidity risk , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources ” and “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — liquidity risk . ” liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations . liquidity is essential to our businesses . our liquidity could be negatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the long - term or short - term debt capital markets , our inability to access the secured lending markets , our inability to attract and retain deposits , or unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral by customers or clients . factors that we can not control , such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally , including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the u.s . and other geographic areas , could impair our ability to raise funding . in addition , our ability to raise funding could be impaired if investors , depositors or lenders develop a negative perception of our long - term or short - term financial prospects due to factors such as an incurrence of large trading , credit or operational losses , a downgrade by the rating agencies , a decline in the level of our business activity , if regulatory authorities take significant action against us or our industry , or if we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity . if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above , we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets , such as our investment portfolios or trading assets , to meet maturing liabilities or other obligations . we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount to market value , either of which could adversely affect our results of operations , cash flows and financial condition . our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend on our credit ratings . the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are impacted by ( among other things ) our long - term and short - term credit ratings . the rating agencies continue to monitor certain firm - specific and industrywide factors that are important to the determination of our credit ratings . these include governance , capital adequacy , the level and quality of earnings , liquidity and funding , risk appetite and management , asset quality , strategic direction , business mix , regulatory or legislative changes , macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support , and it is possible that the rating agencies could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions . our credit ratings also can have an adverse impact on certain trading revenues , particularly in those businesses where longer - term counterparty performance is a key consideration , # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end such as otc and other derivative transactions , including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps . in connection with certain otc trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with our institutional securities business segment , we may be required to provide additional collateral to , or immediately settle any outstanding liability balance with , certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade . termination of our trading agreements could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant payments in the form of cash or securities . the additional collateral or termination payments that may occur in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by moody ’s investors service , inc . , s&p global ratings and/or other rating agencies . see also “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — credit ratings — incremental collateral or terminating payments . ” we are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries . the parent company has no business operations and depends on dividends , distributions , loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations , including debt obligations . regulatory restrictions , tax restrictions or elections and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely , either to or from our subsidiaries . in particular , many of our subsidiaries , including our bank and broker - dealer subsidiaries , are subject to laws , regulations and self - regulatory organization rules that , in certain circumstances , limit , as well as permit regulatory bodies to block or reduce , the flow of funds to the parent company , or that prohibit such transfers or dividends altogether , including steps to “ ring fence ” entities by regulators outside the u.s . to protect clients and creditors of such entities in the event of financial difficulties involving such entities . these laws , regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations . furthermore , as a bhc , we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends . the federal reserve , the occ and the fdic have the authority , and under certain circumstances the duty , to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends or other capital actions by the banking organizations they supervise , including us and our u.s . bank subsidiaries . see “ we may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements ” under “ legal , regulatory and compliance risk ” herein . our liquidity and financial condition have in the past been , and in the future could be , adversely affected by u.s . and international markets and economic conditions . our ability to raise funding in the long - term or short - term debt capital markets or the equity markets , or to access secured lending markets , has in the past been , and could in the future be , adversely affected by conditions in the u.s . and international markets and economies . in particular , our cost and availability of funding in the past have been , and may in the future be , adversely affected by illiquid credit markets , interest rates and wider credit spreads . significant turbulence in the u.s . , the e.u . and other international markets and economies could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us . legal , regulatory and compliance risk legal , regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions ; material financial loss , including fines , penalties , judgments , damages and/or settlements ; limitations on our business ; or loss to reputation we may suffer as a result of our failure to comply with laws , regulations , rules , related self - regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities . this risk also includes contractual and commercial risk , such as the risk that a counterparty ’s performance obligations will be unenforceable . it also includes compliance with aml , terrorist financing and anti - corruption rules and regulations . for more information on how we monitor and manage legal , regulatory and compliance risk , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — legal , regulatory and compliance risk . ” the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation , and changes in regulation will impact our business . like other major financial services firms , we are subject to extensive regulation by u.s . federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business , including an increasing number of complex sanctions and disclosure regimes . these laws and regulations , which continue to increase in volume and complexity , significantly affect the way and costs of doing business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses and limit our ability to expand our product offerings and pursue certain investments . the firm and its employees are subject to wide - ranging regulation and supervision , which , among other things , subject us to intensive scrutiny of our businesses and any plans for expansion of those businesses through acquisitions or otherwise , limitations on activities , a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity and funding requirements and other enhanced prudential standards , # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end resolution regimes and resolution planning requirements , requirements for maintaining minimum amounts of tlac and external long - term debt , restrictions on activities and investments imposed by the volcker rule , comprehensive derivatives regulation , interest rate benchmark requirements , commodities regulation , market structure regulation , consumer protection regulation , tax regulations and interpretations , antitrust laws , trade and transaction reporting obligations , broadened fiduciary obligations and disclosure requirements . new laws , rules , regulations and guidelines , as well as ongoing implementation of , our efforts to comply with , and/or changes to laws , rules , regulations and guidelines , including changes in the breadth , application , interpretation or enforcement of laws , rules , regulations and guidelines , could materially impact the profitability of our businesses and the value of assets we hold , impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate , expose us to additional theories of liability and additional costs , require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses , adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to raise capital , including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors . in addition , regulatory requirements that are imposed by foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations that we are subject to in the u.s . and may adversely affect us . the application of regulatory requirements and strategies in the u.s . or other jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions may pose a greater risk of loss for our security holders and subject us to other restrictions . we are required to submit once every two years to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the u.s . bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure . if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that our resolution plan submission was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution , and if we were unsuccessful in addressing any deficiencies identified by the regulators , we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital , leverage , or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth , activities or operations , or after a two - year period , we may be required to divest assets or operations . in addition , provided that certain procedures are met , we can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under title ii of the dodd - frank act with the fdic being appointed as receiver instead of being resolved under the u.s . bankruptcy code . the fdic ’s power under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the priority of creditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors differently in certain circumstances , subject to certain limitations , could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt . see “ business — supervision and regulation ” and “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — regulatory requirements . ” further , because both our resolution plan contemplates an spoe strategy under the u.s . bankruptcy code and the fdic has proposed an spoe strategy through which it may apply its orderly liquidation authority powers , we believe that the application of an spoe strategy is the reasonably likely outcome if either our resolution plan were implemented or a resolution proceeding were commenced under the orderly liquidation authority . an spoe strategy generally contemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity by the parent company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy , and the parent company has entered into a secured amended and restated support agreement with such entities , pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity to such entities . in addition , a wholly owned , direct subsidiary of the parent company , morgan stanley holdings llc ( “ funding ihc ” ) , serves as a resolution funding vehicle . the parent company has transferred , and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis , certain assets to the funding ihc . in the event of a resolution scenario , the parent company would be obligated to contribute all of its material assets that can be contributed under the terms of the amended and restated support agreement ( other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets ) to the funding ihc . the funding ihc would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity , as applicable , to certain supported subsidiaries , pursuant to the terms of the secured amended and restated support agreement . the obligations of the parent company and of the funding ihc , respectively , under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the parent company ( other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets ) , and the assets of the funding ihc , as applicable . as a result , claims of certain supported subsidiaries , including the funding ihc , against the assets of the parent company with respect to such secured assets are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the parent company . although an spoe strategy , whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or in a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority , is intended to result in better outcomes for creditors overall , there is no guarantee that the application of an spoe strategy , including the provision of support to the parent company ’s supported subsidiaries pursuant to the secured amended and restated support agreement , will not result in greater losses for holders of our securities compared with a different resolution strategy for us . regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an spoe strategy under the u.s . bankruptcy code , # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end the orderly liquidation authority and other resolution regimes . for example , the federal reserve requires top - tier bhcs of u.s . g - sibs , including the firm , to maintain adequate tlac , including equity and eligible long - term debt , in order to ensure that such institutions have enough loss - absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible tlac where the spoe strategy is used . the combined implication of the spoe resolution strategy and the tlac requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible long - term debt and other forms of eligible tlac issued by the parent company before any losses are imposed on the creditors of our supported subsidiaries without requiring taxpayer or government financial support . in addition , certain jurisdictions , including the u.k . and e.u . jurisdictions , have implemented , or are in the process of implementing , changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity . such “ bail - in ” powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors . this may increase the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis and may result in limitations on our ability to efficiently distribute capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities , including in times of stress . non - u.s . regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of tlac that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the parent company and , ultimately , to security holders of the parent company in the event of failure . we may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements . we are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision , regulation and examination by the federal reserve , including with respect to regulatory capital requirements , stress testing and capital planning . we submit , on at least an annual basis , a capital plan to the federal reserve describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders , proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take . our ability to take capital actions described in the capital plan is dependent on , among other factors , the results of supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve . in addition , the federal reserve may change regulatory capital requirements to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose other regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our operating expenses or constrain our ability to take capital actions . for additional information , see “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources . ” the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement investigations , and we may face damage to our reputation and legal liability . as a global financial services firm , we face the risk of investigations and proceedings by governmental and self - regulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct our business . these investigations and proceedings , as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought , continue to impact the financial services industry . certain u.s . and international governmental entities have brought criminal actions against , or have sought criminal convictions , pleas , deferred prosecution agreements or non - prosecution agreements from financial institutions . significant regulatory or law enforcement action against us could materially adversely affect our business , reputation , financial condition or results of operations , and increase our exposure to civil litigation . investigations and proceedings initiated by these authorities may result in adverse judgments , settlements , fines , penalties , disgorgement , restitution , forfeiture , injunctions or other relief , and have included and may in the future include requirements that the firm admit certain conduct , which may result in increased exposure to civil litigation . in addition , these measures have caused and may in the future cause collateral consequences . for example , such matters could impact our ability to engage in , or impose limitations on , certain of our businesses . as part of the resolution of certain investigations and proceedings , the firm has been and may in the future be required to undertake certain measures and failure to do so may result in adverse consequences , such as further investigations or proceedings — both civil and criminal — and additional penalties , fines , judgments or other relief . the dodd - frank act also provides compensation to whistleblowers who present the sec or cftc with information related to securities or commodities law violations that leads to a successful enforcement action . as a result of this compensation , it is possible we could face an increased number of investigations by the sec or cftc . we have been named , from time to time , as a defendant in various legal actions , including arbitrations , class actions and other litigation , as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies , arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution . certain of the actual or threatened legal or regulatory actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages , or may result in material penalties , fines or other results adverse to us . in some cases , the third - party entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt , in financial distress or may not honor applicable indemnification # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end obligations . in other cases , including antitrust litigation , we may be subject to claims for joint and several liability with other defendants for treble damages or other relief related to alleged conspiracies involving other institutions . like any large corporation , we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct , including noncompliance with policies , laws , rules and regulations , and improper use or disclosure of confidential information , or improper sales practices or other conduct . we may be responsible for representations and warranties associated with commercial and residential real estate loans and may incur losses in excess of our reserves . we originate loans secured by commercial and residential properties . further , we securitize and trade in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate - related assets and products . in connection with these activities , we have provided , or otherwise agreed to be responsible for , certain representations and warranties . under certain circumstances , we may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties were breached , and may incur losses as a result . we have also made representations and warranties in connection with our role as an originator of certain loans that we securitized in cmbs and rmbs . for additional information , see note [XX] to the financial statements . a failure to address conflicts of interest appropriately could adversely affect our businesses and reputation . as a global financial services firm that provides products and services to a large and diversified group of clients , including corporations , governments , financial institutions and individuals , we face potential conflicts of interest in the normal course of business . for example , potential conflicts can occur when there is a divergence of interests between us and a client , among clients , between an employee on the one hand and us or a client on the other , or situations in which we may be a creditor of a client . moreover , we utilize multiple brands and business channels , including those resulting from our acquisitions , and continue to enhance the collaboration across business segments , which may heighten the potential conflicts of interest or the risk of improper sharing of information . we have policies , procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address potential conflicts of interest , and we utilize various measures , such as the use of disclosure , to manage these potential conflicts . however , identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and challenging and can become the focus of media and regulatory scrutiny . indeed , actions that merely appear to create a conflict can put our reputation at risk even if the likelihood of an actual conflict has been mitigated . it is possible that potential conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions , which may lead to our clients being less willing to enter into transactions in which a conflict may occur and could adversely affect our businesses and reputation . our regulators also have the ability to scrutinize our activities for potential conflicts of interest , including through detailed examinations of specific transactions . for example , our status as a bhc supervised by the federal reserve subjects us to direct federal reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions between our u.s . bank subsidiaries and their affiliates . further , the volcker rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain transactions between us and our clients . risk management our risk management strategies , models and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk , which could result in unexpected losses . we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future . nonetheless , our risk management strategies , models and processes , including our use of various risk models for assessing market , credit , liquidity and operational exposures and hedging strategies , stress testing and other analysis , may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk , including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated . as our businesses change and grow , including through acquisitions and the introduction and application of new technologies , such as artificial intelligence , and the markets in which we operate evolve , our risk management strategies , models and processes may not always adapt with those changes . some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management ’s judgment . as a result , these methods may not predict future risk exposures , which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate . in addition , many models we use are based on assumptions or inputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators and , therefore , can not anticipate sudden , unanticipated , or unidentified market or economic movements , such as the impact of a pandemic or a sudden geopolitical conflict , which could cause us to incur losses . management of market , credit , liquidity , operational , model , legal , regulatory and compliance risks requires , among other things , policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events , and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective . our trading risk management strategies and techniques also seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses . while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques , those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application can not # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes . for example , to the extent that our trading or investing activities involve less liquid trading markets or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sales or hedging , we may not be able to reduce our positions and , therefore , reduce our risk associated with such positions . we may , therefore , incur losses in the course of our trading or investing activities . for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks and related strategies , models and processes , see “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk — market risk . ” climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could result in increased costs and risks and adversely affect our operations , businesses and clients . there continues to be increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters . the physical risks of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute , climate - related events , such as floods , hurricanes , heatwaves , droughts , and wildfires and chronic , longer - term shifts in climate patterns , such as higher global average temperatures , rising sea levels and long - term droughts . such events could disrupt our operations or those of our clients or third parties on which we rely , including through direct damage to physical assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility . these events could impact the ability of certain of our clients or customers to repay their obligations , reduce the value of collateral , increase costs , including the cost or availability of insurance coverage , and result in other adverse effects . the transition risks of climate change include policy , legal , technology and market changes . examples of these transition risks include changes in consumer and business sentiment , related technologies , shareholder preferences and any additional regulatory and legislative requirements , including increased disclosure or carbon taxes . these risks could increase our expenses and adversely impact our strategies , including by limiting our ability to pursue certain business activities or offer certain products and services . negative impacts to certain of our clients , such as decreased profitability and asset write - downs , could also lead to increased credit , counterparty and liquidity risk to us . in addition , our reputation and client relationships may be adversely impacted as a result of our , or our clients ’ , involvement in certain practices that may have , or are associated with having , an adverse impact on climate change . legislative or regulatory change regarding climate - related risks , including inconsistent requirements and uncertainties , could result in loss of revenue , or increased credit , market , liquidity , regulatory , compliance , reputational and other risks and costs . our ability to achieve our climate - related targets and commitments and the way we go about this could also result in reputational harm as a result of public sentiment , legislative and regulatory scrutiny ( including from u.s . federal and state governments and foreign policymakers and regulators ) , litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence . if we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our current response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient , or the way we respond is perceived negatively , our business and reputation may suffer . the risks associated with , and the perspective of regulators , governments , shareholders , employees and other stakeholders regarding , climate change , as well as geopolitical events , continue to evolve rapidly , making it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate - related risks and uncertainties . as climate risk is interconnected with other risks , we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management practices and governance structures . despite our risk management practices , the unpredictability surrounding the timing and severity of climate - related events and societal or political changes in reaction to them make it difficult to predict , identify , monitor and mitigate climate risks . in addition , the methodologies and data used to manage and monitor climate risk continue to evolve . current approaches utilize information and estimates that have been derived from information or factors released by third - party sources , which may not reflect the latest or most accurate data . climate - related data , particularly greenhouse gas emissions for clients and counterparties , remains limited in availability and varies in quality . certain third - party information may also change over time as methodologies evolve and are refined . while we believe this information is the best available at the time , we may only be able to complete limited validation . furthermore , modeling capabilities and methodologies to analyze climate - related risks , although improving , remain nascent and emerging . these and other factors could cause results to differ materially , which could impact our ability to manage climate - related risks . replacement or reform of certain interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our business , securities , financial condition and results of operations . central banks around the world , including the federal reserve , have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace libor and replace or reform certain other interest rate benchmarks ( collectively , the “ ibors ” ) . a transition away from use of the ibors to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has been underway for a number of years . these reforms have caused and may in the future cause such rates to perform differently than in the past , or to cease entirely , or have other consequences that are contrary to market expectations . the ongoing market transition away from these interest rate benchmarks to alternative reference rates is complex and # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end could have a range of adverse impacts on our business , securities , financial condition and results of operations , including : • adversely impacting the pricing , liquidity , value of , return on and trading for a broad array of financial products , including any securities , loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities that are linked to these interest rate benchmarks ; • inquiries , reviews or other actions from regulators in respect of our ( or the market ’s ) preparation , readiness , transition plans and actions regarding the replacement of a legacy interest rate benchmark with one or more alternative reference rates ; • disputes , litigation or other actions with clients , counterparties and investors in various scenarios , such as regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in ibor - based products such as fallback language or other related provisions , including in the case of fallbacks to the alternative reference rates , any economic , legal , operational or other impact resulting from the fundamental differences between the ibors and the various alternative reference rates or regarding the interpretation of applicable legislation , regulations or rules ; and • causing us to incur additional costs in relation to any of the above factors . other factors include the pace of the transition to the alternative reference rates , timing mismatches between cash and derivative markets , the specific terms and parameters for and market acceptance of any alternative reference rate , market conventions for the use of any alternative reference rate in connection with a particular product ( including the timing and market adoption of any conventions proposed or recommended by any industry or other group ) , prices of and the liquidity of trading markets for products based on alternative reference rates , and our ability to further transition and develop appropriate systems and analytics for one or more alternative reference rates . see also “ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — regulatory requirements — regulatory developments and other matters . ” competitive environment we face strong competition from financial services firms and others , which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability . the financial services industry and all aspects of our businesses are intensely competitive , and we expect them to remain so . we compete with commercial banks , investment banking firms , brokerage firms , insurance companies , exchanges , electronic trading and clearing platforms , financial data repositories , investment advisers and sponsors of mutual funds , hedge funds , real assets funds and private credit and equity funds , energy companies , financial technology firms and other companies offering financial and ancillary services in the u.s . and globally , including , in certain instances , through the internet . we also compete with companies that provide online trading and banking services , investment advisory services , robo - advice capabilities , access to digital asset capabilities and services , and other financial products and services . we compete on the basis of several factors , including transaction execution , capital or access to capital , products and services , innovation , technology , reputation , risk appetite and price . over time , certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated , as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have left businesses , been acquired by or merged into other firms , or have declared bankruptcy . such changes could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources , such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity , or new competitors may emerge . we have experienced and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices , eliminating commissions or other fees , or providing more favorable terms of business . in addition , certain of our competitors may be subject to different and , in some cases , less stringent , legal and regulatory regimes than we are , thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage . some new competitors in the financial technology sector have sought to target existing segments of our businesses that could be susceptible to disruption by innovative or less regulated business models . for more information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate , see “ business — competition ” and “ business — supervision and regulation . ” automated trading markets and the introduction and application of new technologies may adversely affect our business and may increase competition . we continue to experience price competition in some of our businesses . in particular , the ability to execute securities , derivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically on exchanges , swap execution facilities and other automated trading platforms , and the introduction and application of new technologies , including generative artificial intelligence , will likely continue the pressure on revenues . the trend toward direct access to automated , electronic markets will likely continue as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms . we have experienced and will likely continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future . our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance . our people are our most important asset . we compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end and skilled personnel . if we are unable to continue to attract , integrate and retain highly qualified employees or successfully transition key roles , or do so at levels or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive position , our performance , including our competitive position and results of operations , could be materially adversely affected . our ability to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel depends on numerous factors , some of which are outside of our control . compensation costs required to attract and retain employees may increase or the competitive market for talent may further intensify due to factors such as low unemployment , a strong job market and changes in employees ’ expectations , concerns and preferences . the financial industry has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation than other industries , which may or may not impact competitors . these more stringent regulations have shaped our compensation practices , which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees . international risk we are subject to numerous political , economic , legal , tax , operational , franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations that could adversely impact our businesses in many ways . we are subject to numerous political , economic , legal , tax , operational , franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries , including risks of possible nationalization , expropriation , price controls , capital controls , exchange controls , increased taxes and levies , minimum global tax regimes , cybersecurity , data transfer and outsourcing restrictions , regulatory scrutiny regarding the use of new technologies , prohibitions on certain types of foreign and capital market activities , limitations on cross - border listings and other restrictive governmental actions , as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability , including tensions between china and the u.s . , the expansion or escalation of hostilities between russia and ukraine or in the middle east or the initiation or escalation of hostilities or terrorist activity around the world and the potential associated impacts on global and local economies and our operations . in many countries , the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and multinational corporations are uncertain , evolving and subject to sudden change or may be inconsistent with u.s . law . it may also be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or adapt to changes in law , which could adversely impact our businesses . our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally . we are also subject to the risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases . various emerging market countries have experienced severe political , economic or financial disruptions , including significant devaluations of their currencies , defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt , capital and currency exchange controls , high rates of inflation and low or negative growth rates in their economies . crime and corruption , as well as issues of security and personal safety , also exist in certain of these countries . these conditions could adversely impact our businesses and increase volatility in financial markets generally . a disease pandemic , such as covid-19 and its variants , or other widespread health emergencies , natural disasters , climate - related incidents , terrorist activities or military actions , or social or political tensions , could create economic and financial disruptions in emerging markets or in other areas of the global economy that could adversely affect our businesses , or could lead to operational difficulties , including travel limitations and supply chain complications , that could impair our ability to manage or conduct our businesses around the world . as a u.s . company , we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by ofac and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies worldwide , which may be inconsistent with local law . we and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to applicable aml and/or anti - corruption laws in the u.s . , as well as in the jurisdictions in which we operate , including the bank secrecy act , the u.s . foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k . bribery act . a violation of a sanction , embargo program , aml or anti - corruption law could subject us , and individual employees , to a regulatory enforcement action , as well as significant civil and criminal penalties . acquisition , divestiture and joint venture risk we may be unable to fully capture the expected value from acquisitions , divestitures , joint ventures , partnerships , minority stakes or strategic alliances , and certain acquisitions may subject our business to new or increased risk . in connection with past or future acquisitions , divestitures , joint ventures , partnerships , minority stakes or strategic alliances ( including with mitsubishi ufj financial group , inc . ( “ mufg ” ) ) , we face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining , transferring , separating or integrating the relevant businesses and systems that may present operational and other risks , including the need to combine or separate accounting , data processing and other systems , management controls and legal entities , and to integrate relationships with clients , trading counterparties and business partners . certain of these strategic initiatives , and integration thereof , may cause us to incur incremental expenses and may also require incremental financial , management and other resources . in the case of joint ventures , partnerships and minority stakes , we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties because # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] - k [XX] # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end we may be dependent upon , and subject to liability , losses or reputational damage relating to systems , controls and personnel that are not under our control , and conflicts or disagreements between us and any of our joint venture partners or partners may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved by the relevant joint venture or partnership , respectively . there is no assurance that any of our acquisitions , divestitures or investments will be successfully integrated or disaggregated or yield all of the positive benefits and synergies anticipated . if we are not able to integrate or disaggregate successfully our past and future acquisitions or dispositions , including aligning the processes , policies and procedures of the acquired entities with our standards , there is a risk that our results of operations , financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected . certain of our business initiatives , including expansions of existing businesses , may change our client or account profile or bring us into contact , directly or indirectly , with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes , services , competitors and new markets . these business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks , greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities , increased credit - related , sovereign , compliance and operational risks , as well as franchise and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held , or services are being delivered . for more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate , see also “ business — supervision and regulation . ” # # table_start [XX] december [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end # # table_start # # table_end cybersecurity risk management and strategy we , our businesses , and the broader financial services industry face an increasingly complex and evolving threat environment . we have made and continue to make substantial investments in cybersecurity and fraud prevention technology , and employ experienced talent to lead our cybersecurity and information security organizations and program under the oversight of our board of directors ( “ board ” ) and the operations and technology committee of the board ( “ botc ” ) . see “ risk factors — operational risk ” for information on risks to the firm from cybersecurity threats . as part of our enterprise risk management ( “ erm ” ) framework , we have implemented and maintain a program to assess , identify and manage risks arising from the cybersecurity threats confronting the firm ( “ cybersecurity program ” ) . our cybersecurity program helps protect our clients , customers , employees , property , products , services and reputation by seeking to preserve the confidentiality , integrity and availability of information , enable the secure delivery of financial services , and protect the business and the safe operation of our technology systems . we continually adjust our cybersecurity program to address the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape and comply with extensive legal and regulatory expectations . processes for assessing , identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats our cybersecurity program takes into account industry best practices and addresses risks from cybersecurity threats to our network , infrastructure , computing environment and the third parties that we rely on . we periodically assess the design of our cybersecurity controls against the cyber risk institute cyber profile , which is based on the national institute of standards and technology ( “ nist ” ) cybersecurity framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity , as well as global cybersecurity regulations , and develop improvements to those controls in response to that assessment . our cybersecurity program also includes cybersecurity and information security policies , procedures and technologies that are designed to address regulatory requirements and protect our clients ’ , employees ’ and own data against unauthorized disclosure , modification and misuse . these policies , procedures and technologies cover a broad range of areas , including : identification of internal and external threats , access control , data security , protective controls , detection of malicious or unauthorized activity , incident response , and recovery planning . our threat intelligence function within the cybersecurity program actively engages in private and public information sharing communities and leverages both commercial and proprietary products to collect a wide variety of industry and governmental information regarding the latest cybersecurity threats , which informs our cybersecurity risk assessments and strategy . this information is also provided to an internal forensics team , which develops and implements technologies designed to help detect these cybersecurity threats across our environment . where a potential threat is identified in our environment , our incident response team evaluates the potential impact to the firm and coordinates remediation where required . these groups , as well as the operational risk department , review external cybersecurity incidents that may be relevant to the firm , and the outcomes of these incidents further inform the design of our cybersecurity program . in addition , we maintain a robust global training program on cybersecurity risks and requirements and conduct regular phishing email simulations for our employees and consultants . our processes are designed to help oversee , identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third - party vendors . we maintain a third - party risk management program that includes evaluation of , and response to , cybersecurity risks at our third - party vendors . prior to engaging third - party vendors to provide services to the firm , we conduct assessments of the third - party vendors ’ cybersecurity programs to identify the impact of their services on the cybersecurity risks to the firm . once on - boarded , third - party vendors ’ cybersecurity programs are subject to risk - based oversight , which may include security questionnaires , submission of independent security audit reports or a firm audit of the third - party vendor ’s security program , and , with limited exceptions , third - party vendors are required to meet our cybersecurity standards . where a third - party vendor can not meet those standards , its services , and the residual risk to the firm , are subject to review , challenge and escalation through our risk management processes and erm committees , which may ultimately result in requesting increased security measures or ceasing engagement with such third - party vendor . our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed by the internal audit department ( “ iad ” ) through various assurance activities , with the results reported to the audit committee of the board ( “ bac ” ) and the botc . annually , certain elements of the cybersecurity program are subject to an audit by an independent consultant , as well as an assessment by a separate , independent third party , the results of which , including opportunities identified for improvement and related remediation plans , are reviewed with the botc . our cybersecurity program is also examined regularly by the firm ’s prudential and conduct regulators within the scope of their jurisdiction . governance management ’s role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats our cybersecurity program is operated and maintained by management , including the chief information officer of cyber , data , risk and resilience ( “ cio ” ) and the chief information security officer ( “ ciso ” ) . these senior officers # # table_start december [XXXX] form [XX] -

relations portion of our website in march [XXXX] ( the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form [XX] - k ) . government supervision and regulation the following discussion describes , among other things , elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bhcs , financial holding companies , banks and broker - dealers , including specific information about bank of america . we are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bhcs , financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities . u.s . federal regulation of banks , bhcs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund ( dif ) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors . as a registered financial holding company and bhc , the corporation is subject to the supervision of , and regular inspection by , the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) . our u.s . bank subsidiaries ( the banks ) , organized as national banking associations , are subject to regulation , supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) , the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) and the federal reserve . in addition , the federal reserve and the occ have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design , implementation and board oversight of bhcs ’ and national banks ’ risk governance frameworks . u.s . financial holding companies , and the companies under their control , are permitted to engage in activities considered “ financial in nature ” as defined by the gramm - leach - bliley act and related federal reserve interpretations . the corporation 's status as a financial holding company is conditioned upon maintaining certain eligibility requirements for both the corporation and its u.s . depository institution subsidiaries , including minimum capital ratios , supervisory ratings and , in the case of the depository institutions , at least satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings . failure to be an eligible financial holding company could result in the federal reserve limiting bank of america 's activities , including potential acquisitions . additionally , we are subject to a significant number of laws , rules and regulations that govern our businesses in the u.s . and in the other jurisdictions in which we operate , including permissible activities , minimum levels of capital and liquidity , compliance risk management , consumer products and sales practices , privacy , data protection and executive compensation , among others . the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased over the past several years , beginning with the response to the [XXXX] financial crisis , as well as other factors such as technological and market changes . in addition , the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and fines . many of these changes have occurred as a result of the [XXXX] dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( the financial reform act ) . we can not assess whether or not there will be any additional major changes in the regulatory environment and expect that our business will remain subject to continuing and extensive regulation and supervision . we are also subject to various other laws and regulations , as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies , all of which directly or indirectly affect our entities , management and ability to make distributions to shareholders . for instance , our broker - dealer subsidiaries are subject to both u.s . and international regulation , including supervision by the sec , financial industry regulatory authority and new york stock exchange , among others ; our futures commission merchant subsidiary supporting commodities and derivatives businesses in the u.s . is subject to regulation by and supervision of the u.s . commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , national futures association , the chicago mercantile exchange , and in the case of the banks , certain banking regulators ; our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies ; and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) . in addition , certain u.s . and foreign subsidiaries are also registered with the cftc as swap dealers , and conditionally registered with the sec as security - based swap dealers . our non - u.s . businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various non - u.s . regulators , including governments , securities exchanges , prudential regulators , central banks and other regulatory bodies , in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate . for example , our financial services entities in the united kingdom ( u.k . ) , ireland and france are subject to regulation by the prudential regulatory authority and financial conduct authority , the european central bank and central bank of ireland , and the autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution and autorité des marchés financiers , respectively . the corporation is also subject to extensive laws , rules and regulations in the u.s . and in the other jurisdictions in which it operates regarding bribery and corruption , know - your - customer requirements , anti - money laundering , embargo programs and economic sanctions . for example , we are subject to the u.s . bank secrecy act ( bsa ) , which contains anti - money laundering and financial transparency laws designed to detect and deter money laundering and the financing of terrorism , as well as record - keeping , reporting , due diligence and customer verification requirements , various sanctions programs administered and enforced by the u.s . department of the treasury ’s office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) and foreign jurisdictions , which target entities or individuals that are , or are located in countries that are , involved in activities , such as terrorism , hostilities , drug trafficking or human rights violations and the u.s . foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ) and the u.k . bribery act , relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others . source of strength under the financial reform act and federal reserve policy , bhcs are expected to act as a source of financial strength to # # table_start bank of america [X] # # table_end each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary . similarly , under the cross - guarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of [XXXX] ( fdicia ) , in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic , either as a result of default of a bank subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default , the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the fdic ’s loss , subject to certain exceptions . transactions with affiliates pursuant to section 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act , as implemented by the federal reserve ’s regulation w , the banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the banks and their nonbank affiliates . in general , u.s . banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit , purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving their nonbank affiliates . additionally , transactions between u.s . banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm ’s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness . deposit insurance deposits placed at u.s . domiciled banks are insured by the fdic , subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the fdic ’s regulations . pursuant to the financial reform act , fdic insurance coverage limits are $ [XXX,XXX] per depositor , per insured bank for each account ownership category . all insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic in order to fund the dif . the fdic is required to maintain a statutory minimum ratio of the dif to insured deposits in the u.s . of at least [X.XX] percent and has established a long - term goal of a two percent dif ratio . as of the date of this report , the dif is below the statutory minimum ratio and the fdic ’s long - term goal . in october [XXXX] , the fdic adopted a restoration plan that includes an increase in deposit insurance assessments across the industry of two basis points ( bps ) . the fdic has indicated that it intends to maintain such assessment rates for the foreseeable future . deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the fdic and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole . the fdic also has the authority to charge special assessments from time to time , including in connection with systemic risk events . for example , on november [XX] , [XXXX] , the fdic issued its final rule to impose a special assessment to recover the loss to the dif resulting from the closure of silicon valley bank and signature bank . for more information on the impact to the corporation of the fdic special assessment , see executive summary – recent developments in the md&a on page [XX] . for more information regarding deposit insurance , see item 1a . risk factors – regulatory , compliance and legal on page [XX] . capital , liquidity and operational requirements as a financial holding company , we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity rules issued by the federal reserve and other u.s . banking regulators , including the occ and the fdic . these rules are complex and are evolving as u.s . and international regulatory authorities propose and enact amendments to these rules . the corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory rules and to support our business activities . these continually evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity , as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the corporation . for more information on regulatory capital rules , capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes , see capital management on page [XX] and note [XX] – regulatory requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements , which are incorporated by reference in this item [X] . distributions we are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions , including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases . for instance , federal reserve regulations require major u.s . bhcs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ( ccar ) . our ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers and non - capital standards established under the fdicia . to the extent that the federal reserve increases our stress capital buffer ( scb ) , global systemically important bank ( g - sib ) surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer , our returns of capital to shareholders , including dividends and common stock repurchases , could decrease . as part of its ccar , the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve . those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results , which may impact the level of our scb . for example , based on the results of our [XXXX] ccar stress test , the corporation ’s scb decreased to [X.X] percent . additionally , the corporation ’s g - sib surcharge increased to [X.X] percent on january [X] , [XXXX] . the federal reserve could also impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock . for example , as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the covid-19 pandemic , in the second half of [XXXX] , the federal reserve introduced certain limitations to capital distributions for all large banks , including the corporation , which were removed effective july [X] , [XXXX] . if the federal reserve finds that any of our banks are not “ well - capitalized ” or “ well - managed , ” we would be required to enter into an agreement with the federal reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements , which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities . additionally , the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine , under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bhc , that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof . many of our subsidiaries , including our bank and broker - dealer subsidiaries , are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments , or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries . the rights of the corporation , our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries are further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries . for more information regarding distributions , including the minimum capital requirements , see note [XX] – shareholders ’ equity and note [XX] – regulatory requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements . # # table_start [X] bank of america # # table_end resolution planning as a bhc with greater than $ [XXX] billion of assets , the corporation is required by the federal reserve and the fdic to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure . such resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the bhc , including the continued operations or solvent wind down of its material entities , pursuant to the u.s . bankruptcy code under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance . if both the federal reserve and the fdic determine that the bhc ’s plan is not credible , the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose more stringent capital , leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth , activities or operations . a summary of our plan is available on the federal reserve and fdic websites . the fdic also requires the submission of a resolution plan for bank of america , national association , which must describe how the insured depository institution would be resolved under the bank resolution provisions of the federal deposit insurance act . a description of this plan is available on the fdic ’s website . we continue to make substantial progress to enhance our resolvability , which includes continued improvements to our preparedness capabilities to implement our resolution plan , both from a financial and operational standpoint . across international jurisdictions , resolution planning is the responsibility of national resolution authorities ( ra ) and central resolution authorities ( ca ) . among those , the jurisdictions with the greatest impact to the corporation ’s subsidiaries are the u.k . , ireland and france , where rules have been issued requiring the submission of significant information about locally incorporated subsidiaries as well as the corporation ’s banking branches located in those jurisdictions that are deemed to be material for resolution planning purposes . as a result of the ra ’s and ca 's review of the submitted information , we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years that could increase operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries . for more information regarding our resolution plan , see item 1a . risk factors – liquidity on page [X] . insolvency and the orderly liquidation authority under the federal deposit insurance act , the fdic may be appointed receiver of an insured depository institution if it is insolvent or in certain other circumstances . in addition , under the financial reform act , when a systemically important financial institution ( sifi ) such as the corporation is in default or danger of default , the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution . in the event of such appointment , the fdic could , among other things , invoke the orderly liquidation authority , instead of the u.s . bankruptcy code , if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations . the orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the federal deposit insurance act , but also adopts certain concepts from the u.s . bankruptcy code . the orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the u.s . bankruptcy code . for example , in certain circumstances , the fdic could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant ( e.g. , short - term creditors or operating creditors ) in lieu of paying other obligations ( e.g. , long - term creditors ) without the need to obtain creditors ’ consent or prior court review . the insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a bhc ’s outstanding equity , as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt . under the fdic ’s “ single point of entry ” strategy for resolving sifis , the fdic could replace a distressed bhc with a bridge holding company , which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank , but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original bhc . furthermore , the federal reserve requires that bhcs maintain minimum levels of long - term debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a resolution . for more information regarding our resolution , see item 1a . risk factors – liquidity on page [X] . limitations on acquisitions the riegle - neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of [XXXX] permits a bhc to acquire banks located in states other than its home state without regard to state law , subject to certain conditions , including the condition that the bhc , after and as a result of the acquisition , controls no more than [XX] percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the u.s . and no more than [XX] percent or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state . at june [XX] , [XXXX] , we held greater than [XX] percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the u.s . in addition , the financial reform act restricts acquisitions by a financial institution if , as a result of the acquisition , the total liabilities of the financial institution would exceed [XX] percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in the u.s . at june [XX] , [XXXX] , our liabilities did not exceed [XX] percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in the u.s . the volcker rule the volcker rule prohibits insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions ( collectively , banking entities ) from engaging in short - term proprietary trading of certain securities , derivatives , commodity futures and options for their own account . the volcker rule also imposes limits on banking entities ’ investments in , and other relationships with , hedge funds and private equity funds . the volcker rule provides exemptions for certain activities , including market making , underwriting , hedging , trading in government obligations , insurance company activities and organizing and offering hedge funds and private equity funds . the volcker rule also clarifies that certain activities are not prohibited , including acting as agent , broker or custodian . a banking entity with significant trading operations , such as the corporation , is required to maintain a detailed compliance program to comply with the restrictions of the volcker rule . derivatives our derivatives businesses are subject to extensive regulation globally , including under the financial reform act , the european union ( eu ) markets in financial instruments directive and regulation , the european market infrastructure regulation , analogous u.k . regulatory regimes and similar regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions . these regulations , among other things , require clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives , establish capital , margin , reporting , registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants , set position limits on certain derivatives and set out derivatives trading transparency requirements . in addition , many g-20 jurisdictions , including the u.s . , eu , u.k . , and japan , have adopted resolution stay regulations to address concerns that the close - out of derivatives and other # # table_start bank of america [X] # # table_end financial contracts could impede orderly resolution of g - sibs , and additional jurisdictions are expected to follow suit . generally , these regulations require amendment of certain financial contracts to provide for contractual recognition of stays of termination rights under various statutory resolution regimes and a stay on the exercise of cross - default rights based on an affiliate ’s entry into insolvency proceedings . resolution regulations may also require contractual recognition by the counterparty that amounts owed to them may be written down or converted into equity as part of a bail in . as resolution stay regulations of a particular jurisdiction applicable to us go into effect , we amend impacted financial contracts in compliance with such regulations either as a regulated entity or as a counterparty facing a regulated entity in such jurisdiction . consumer regulations our consumer businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by federal and state regulators . certain federal consumer finance laws to which we are subject , including the equal credit opportunity act , home mortgage disclosure act , fair housing act , electronic fund transfer act ( efta ) , fair credit reporting act , real estate settlement procedures act , prohibitions on unfair , deceptive , or abusive acts or practices , truth in lending act and truth in savings act , are enforced by the cfpb . other federal consumer finance laws , such as the servicemembers civil relief act , are enforced by the occ . privacy and information security we are subject to many u.s . federal , state and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures regarding the collection , disclosure , use and protection of the non - public confidential information of our customers and employees . the gramm - leach - bliley act requires us to periodically disclose bank of america ’s privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties , under certain circumstances . the gramm - leach - bliley act and other laws also require us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative , technical and physical safeguards to provide the security and confidentiality of customer records and information . security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations . other laws and regulations , at the international , federal and state level , impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non - affiliates for marketing and/or non - marketing purposes , or contact customers with marketing offers and establish certain rights of consumers in connection with their personal information . for example , california ’s consumer privacy act ( ccpa ) , as modified by the california privacy rights act ( cpra ) , provides consumers with the right to know what personal data is being collected , know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom and opt out of the sale of their personal data , among other rights . in addition , in the eu and other countries around the world , similar laws , like the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) , afford those countries ’ residents with certain rights related to their information and may impose additional obligations on financial institutions . these laws ’ impact on the corporation was assessed and addressed through comprehensive compliance implementation programs . these existing and evolving legal requirements in the u.s . and abroad , as well as court proceedings and changing guidance from regulatory bodies , including the validity of cross - border data transfer mechanisms from the eu and other jurisdictions , continue to lend uncertainty to privacy compliance globally . additionally , the corporation is subject to evolving information security ( including cybersecurity ) laws , rules and regulations enacted by u.s . federal and state governments and non - u.s . jurisdictions , including requirements to develop cybersecurity programs , policies and frameworks , as well as provide disclosure and/or notifications of certain cybersecurity incidents and data breaches . # # table_start [X] bank of america # # table_end","item 1a . risk factors the discussion below addresses our material risk factors of which we are aware . any risk factor , either by itself or together with other risk factors , could materially and adversely affect our businesses , results of operations , cash flows and/or financial condition . references to third parties may include suppliers , service providers , counterparties , financial market utilities , exchanges and clearing houses , data aggregators and other partners and their upstream and downstream service providers ( e.g. , fourth parties , fifth parties ) who may also contribute to our risks . other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also adversely affect our businesses , results of operations , cash flows and/or financial condition . therefore , the risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that we may face . for more information on how we manage risks , see managing risk in the md&a beginning on page [XX] . for more information about the risks contained in this section , see item [X] . business beginning on page [X] , md&a beginning on page [XX] and notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page [XX] . market we may be adversely affected by the financial markets , fiscal , monetary , and regulatory policies , and economic conditions . general economic , political , social and health conditions in the u.s . and abroad affect financial markets and our business . in particular , global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates , availability and market conditions of financing , changes in gross domestic product ( gdp ) , economic growth or its sustainability , inflation , supply chain disruptions , consumer spending , employment levels , labor shortages , challenging labor market conditions , wage stagnation , federal government shutdowns , energy prices , home prices , commercial property values , bankruptcies and a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties , including companies in emerging markets . global markets also may be affected by adverse developments impacting the u.s . or global banking industry , including bank failures and liquidity concerns , fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies , the transition of benchmark rates , including the bloomberg short - term bank yield index ( bsby ) , to alternative reference rates ( arrs ) , the impact of the volatility of digital assets on the broader market , the rate of growth of global trade and commerce , trade policies , the availability and cost of capital and credit , disruption of communication , transportation or energy infrastructure , recessionary fears , investor sentiment and the u.s . and global election cycles , including resulting changes to policy and the geopolitical environment . global markets , including energy and commodity markets , may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change , acute and/or chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters , the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics , cyberattacks , military conflict , terrorism , or other geopolitical events . market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our liquidity . any sudden or prolonged market downturn , as a result of the above factors or otherwise , could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition , including capital and liquidity levels . elevated inflation and interest rate levels , monetary tightening by central banks , and geopolitical developments , including the russia / ukraine conflict and the conflict in the middle east , have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in additional market volatility and disruptions . global uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges . actions taken by the federal reserve or central banks in other jurisdictions , including changes in target rates , balance sheet management and lending facilities , are beyond our control and difficult to predict , particularly in an elevated inflation environment . this can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets , such as debt securities , and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency rates and may also raise government debt levels , adversely affect businesses and household incomes , adversely impact the banking sector generally , and increase uncertainty surrounding monetary policy . monetary policy in response to high inflation has led to a significant increase in market interest rates and a flattening and/or inversion of the yield curve . this has resulted in and may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets , further volatility of the u.s . dollar , a widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates and recessionary concerns , and could result in elevated unemployment , which could impact investor risk appetite and our borrowers , potentially increasing delinquency rates . financial market volatility could also result from uncertainty about the timing and extent of rate cuts by the federal reserve in response to moderating inflation and/or weakening economic conditions . elevated inflation may limit the scope of monetary support , including cuts to the federal funds rate , in the event of an economic downturn , resulting in a more protracted period of a flat and/or inverted yield curve . any future change in monetary policy by the federal reserve , in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise , resulting in lower interest rates would likely result in lower revenue through lower net interest income , which could adversely affect our results of operations . additionally , changes to existing u.s . laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities , including those related to financial regulation , taxation , international trade , fiscal policy , climate change ( including efforts to transition to a low - carbon economy ) and healthcare , may adversely impact u.s . or global economic activity and our customers ' , our counterparties ' and our earnings and operations . globally , many central banks have simultaneously reduced monetary accommodation through interest rate or balance sheet policy , which has contributed and may continue to contribute to elevated financial and capital market volatility and significant changes to asset values . while higher interest rates have positively impacted our net interest income , higher interest rates have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact investment securities , deposits , loan demand and funding costs . in addition to higher interest rates , wider credit spreads can negatively impact capital by reducing the value of debt securities . high and rising federal debt levels and uncertainty about the u.s . budget process could lead to higher interest rates and financial market volatility , potentially impacting broader economic activity . further , if the u.s . government ’s debt ceiling limit is not raised in january [XXXX] , the ramifications could result in market volatility , ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions . this could have a negative and potentially severe impact on the u.s . and world economy and financial and capital markets , including higher interest rates , higher volatility , lower asset values , lower liquidity , downgrades to u.s . debt , and a weakened u.s . dollar . changes to international trade and investment policies by the u.s . could negatively impact financial markets . escalation of tensions between the u.s . and the people ’s republic of china # # table_start bank of america [X] # # table_end ( china ) could lead to further u.s . measures that adversely affect financial markets , disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation , including through the use of tariffs , foreign exchange measures or the large - scale sale of u.s . treasury bonds . any restrictions on the activities of businesses , could also negatively affect financial markets . these developments could adversely affect our businesses , customers , securities and derivatives portfolios , including the risk of lower re - investment rates within those portfolios , our level of charge - offs and provision for credit losses , the carrying value of our deferred tax assets , our capital levels , our liquidity and our results of operations . increased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk . our liquidity , competitive position , business , results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates , fluctuations in equity , commodity and futures prices , trading volumes and prices of securitized products , the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors . these market risks may adversely affect , among other things , the value of our securities , including our on- and off - balance sheet securities , trading assets and other financial instruments , the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets , the value of assets under management ( aum ) , fee income relating to aum , customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives , the volume of client activity in our trading operations , investment banking , underwriting and other capital market fees , which have already been negatively impacted , the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing . the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates . if the federal reserve or a non - u.s . central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy , market interest rates or credit spreads could be affected , which could adversely impact the value of such assets . changes to fiscal policy , including expansion of u.s . federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance , could also affect market interest rates . if interest rates decrease , our results of operations could be negatively impacted , including future revenue and earnings growth . our models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures are subject to inherent limitations . in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances , previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated . such changes to the relationship between market parameters may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses . changes in correlation can be exacerbated where market participants use risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours . in these and other cases , it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations , including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists . where we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging , or where the degree of accessible liquidity declines significantly , we may not be able to reduce our positions and risks associated with such holdings , so we may suffer larger than expected losses when adverse price movements take place . this risk can be exacerbated where we hold a position that is large relative to the available liquidity . if asset values decline , we may incur losses and negative impacts to capital and liquidity requirements . we have a large portfolio of financial instruments , including loans and loan commitments , securities financing agreements , asset - backed secured financings , derivative assets and liabilities , debt securities , marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and are subject to valuation and impairment assessments . we determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance , which , for financial instruments measured at fair value , requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements . the fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity , credit quality , funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction - specific factors , where appropriate . gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations , unless we have effectively mitigated the risk of our exposures . increases in interest rates may cause decreases in residential mortgage loan originations and could impact the origination of corporate debt . in addition , increases in interest rates or changes in spreads may continue to adversely impact the fair value of our debt securities and , accordingly , for debt securities classified as available - for - sale ( afs ) , adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and , thus , our capital levels . increases in interest rates could also adversely impact our regulatory liquidity position and requirements , which include certain afs debt securities and the use of repurchase agreements against a portion of the held - to - maturity ( htm ) debt securities . as our liquidity is dependent on the fair value of these assets , increases in market interest rates , which have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the fair value of debt securities , could adversely affect liquidity levels . fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices . the financial strength of counterparties , with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets , also will affect the fair value of these assets . sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets , which may make it difficult to sell , hedge or value these assets . the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions , and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk - weighted assets ( rwa ) , which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs . values of aum also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for asset - based management and performance fees . declines in values of aum can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets . liquidity if we are unable to access the capital markets , have prolonged net deposits outflows , or our borrowing costs increase , our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected . liquidity is essential to our businesses . we fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities , as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets . we rely on certain secured funding sources , such as repo markets , which are typically short - term and credit - sensitive . we also engage in asset securitization transactions , including with the government - sponsored enterprises ( gses ) , to fund consumer lending activities . our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets , illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets , the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements ( including as a result of credit concerns for short - term # # table_start [X] bank of america # # table_end borrowing ) , changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile , prolonged federal government shutdowns , or changes in regulations , guidance or gse status that impact our funding . additionally , our liquidity or cost of funds may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the federal reserve to act as lender of last resort , unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit or deposits , slower customer payment rates , restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients , the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds ( which could result from attrition driven by customers seeking higher yielding deposits or securities products , customer desire to utilize an alternative financial institution perceived to be safer , changes in customer spending behavior due to inflation , decline in the economy or other drivers resulting in an increased need for cash ) , increased regulatory liquidity , capital and margin requirements for our u.s . or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries , which could result in the inability to transfer liquidity internally and inefficient funding , changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or default by a significant market participant or third party ( including clearing agents , custodians , central banks or central counterparty clearinghouses ( ccps ) ) . these factors may increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our liquidity . several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control , such as general market volatility , disruption , shock or stress , the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics , and military conflicts ( including the russia / ukraine conflict and the conflict in the middle east ) . federal reserve policy decisions ( including fluctuations in interest rates or federal reserve balance sheet composition ) , negative views or loss of confidence about us or the financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event , changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies , actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us . the impact of these potentially sudden events , whether within our control or not , could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments , unforeseen outflows of cash , the need to draw on liquidity facilities , the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding , debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests , the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies and unexpected collateral calls , among other things , the result of which could be increased costs , a liquidity shortfall and/or impact on our liquidity coverage ratio . our liquidity and cost of obtaining funding may be directly related to investor behavior and confidence , debt market disruption , firm specific concerns or prevailing market conditions , including changes in interest and currency exchange rates , significant fluctuations in equity and futures prices , lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products and our credit spreads . increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in mark - to - market or credit valuation adjustment exposures . changes in our credit spreads are market driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness , including changes in our credit ratings or changes in broader financial market and macroeconomic conditions . changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile . we may also experience net interest margin compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits . concentrations within our funding profile , such as maturities , currencies or counterparties , can also reduce our funding efficiency . reduction in our credit ratings could limit our access to funding or the capital markets , increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements . our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings . credit ratings are also important to investors , customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions , including over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives . our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies , which consider a number of financial and nonfinancial factors , including our franchise , financial strength , performance and prospects , management , governance , risk management practices , capital adequacy , asset quality and operations , among other criteria , as well as factors not under our control , such as regulatory developments , the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and changes to the methodologies used to determine our ratings . rating agencies could adjust our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to whether or when a downgrade could occur . any reduction could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our access to credit markets , the related cost of funds , our businesses and certain trading revenues , particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical . if the short - term credit ratings of our parent company , bank or broker - dealer subsidiaries were downgraded , we may experience loss of access to short - term funding sources such as repo financing , and/or incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements . under the terms of certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements , if our or our subsidiaries ’ credit ratings are downgraded , the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements . while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable , the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain and depend upon numerous dynamic , complex and inter - related factors and assumptions , including the relationship between long - term and short - term credit ratings and the behaviors of customers , investors and counterparties . bank of america corporation is a holding company , is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity and may be restricted from transferring funds from subsidiaries . bank of america corporation , as the parent company , is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries . we evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis . legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal , regulatory , contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another , including the parent company , which could result in adverse liquidity events . the parent company depends on dividends , distributions , loans and other payments from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our preferred stock and common stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations , including debt obligations . any inability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds , pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow , liquidity and financial condition . many of our subsidiaries , including our bank and broker - dealer subsidiaries , are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments , or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries . our bank and broker - dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates , minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements # # table_start bank of america [XX] # # table_end and restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses . intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions . additional restrictions on related party transactions , increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts , as well as lower earnings , can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries . also , regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends . in addition , our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary ’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiary ’s creditors . bank of america corporation ’s liquidity and financial condition , and the ability to pay dividends and obligations , could be adversely affected in the event of a resolution . bank of america corporation , our parent holding company , is required to periodically submit a plan to the fdic and federal reserve describing its resolution strategy under the u.s . bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure . bank of america corporation ’s preferred resolution strategy is a “ single point of entry ” strategy , whereby only the parent holding company would file for bankruptcy under the u.s . bankruptcy code . certain key operating subsidiaries would be provided with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company . bank of america corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries . pursuant to these arrangements , if bank of america corporation ’s liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent , it will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a wholly - owned holding company subsidiary . this could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition , including the ability to meet our payment obligations and the ability to return capital to shareholders , including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the corporation ’s common stock . if the fdic and federal reserve jointly determine that bank of america corporation ’s resolution plan is not credible , they could impose more stringent capital , leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth , activities or operations . we could also be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and result in the divestiture of assets or restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries . when a g - sib such as bank of america corporation is in default or danger of default , the fdic may be appointed receiver to conduct an orderly liquidation , and could , among other things , invoke the orderly liquidation authority , instead of the u.s . bankruptcy code , if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations . additionally , the fdic could replace bank of america corporation with a bridge holding company , which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank , but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors . the fdic ’s “ single point of entry ” strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy . if the corporation is resolved under the u.s . bankruptcy code or the fdic ’s orderly liquidation authority , third - party creditors of our subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims , while security holders of bank of america corporation could face significant or complete losses . credit economic or market disruptions and insufficient credit loss reserves may result in a higher provision for credit losses . a number of our products expose us to credit risk , including loans , letters of credit , derivatives , debt securities , trading account assets and assets held - for - sale . deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers , counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . our credit portfolios may be impacted by u.s . and global macroeconomic and market conditions , events and disruptions , including declines in gdp , consumer spending or property values , asset price corrections , increasing consumer and corporate leverage , increases in corporate bond spreads , government shutdowns or policies such as student loan debt payment resumptions , tax changes , rising or elevated unemployment levels , elevated inflation , fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates , as well as the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics , extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change , including acute and/or chronic extreme weather events and efforts to transition to a low - carbon economy . significant economic or market stresses and disruptions typically have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets , which could impact the underlying credit quality of our borrowers , counterparties and assets . property value declines or asset price corrections could increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties defaulting or becoming delinquent in their obligations to us , and could decrease the value of the collateral we hold , which could increase credit losses . credit risk could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or declining asset prices , including property or collateral values , unrelated to macroeconomic stress . simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit and/or an increase in a borrower ’s leverage in a weakening economic environment , or otherwise , could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio , should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations . increased delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our credit portfolios , including consumer credit card , home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased charge - offs and provisions for credit losses . a recessionary environment and/or a rise in unemployment could adversely impact the ability of our consumer and/or commercial borrowers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations and negatively impact our credit portfolio . consumers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by inflation , resulting in drawdowns of savings or increases in household debt . higher interest rates , which have increased debt servicing costs for some businesses and households , may adversely impact credit quality , particularly in a recessionary environment . certain sectors also remain at risk ( e.g. , commercial real estate , particularly office ) as a result of shifts in demand and tighter financial and credit conditions . globally , conditions of slow growth or recession could further contribute to weaker credit conditions . if the macroeconomic environment or certain sectors worsen , our credit portfolio , net charge - offs , provision and allowance for credit losses could be adversely impacted . # # table_start [XX] bank of america # # table_end we establish an allowance for credit losses , which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments , based on management 's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses ( ecl ) inherent in our relevant financial assets . the process to determine the allowance for credit losses uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated , including forecasting how borrowers or counterparties may perform in changing economic conditions . the ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations may be impacted by changes in future economic conditions , which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates . there is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers or counterparties , which could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates . if the models , estimates and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties , which are more sensitive due to the current uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment , prove inaccurate in predicting future events , we may suffer losses in excess of our ecl . in addition , changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses . the allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of ecl ; however , there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses , particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly , quickly , or unexpectedly . as circumstances change , we may increase our allowance , which would reduce our earnings . if economic conditions worsen , impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers , counterparties or underlying collateral , and credit losses are worse than expected , we may increase our provision for credit losses , which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . our concentrations of credit risk could adversely affect our credit losses , results of operations and financial condition . we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic , financial , public health or business developments . concentrations of credit risk may reside in a particular industry , geography , product , asset class , counterparty or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic . a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry , geographic location , product or asset class , or a failure or downgrade of , or default by , any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses , and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated . we execute a high volume of transactions and have significant credit concentrations with respect to the financial services industry , predominantly comprised of broker - dealers , commercial banks , investment banks , insurance companies , mutual funds , hedge funds , ccps and other institutional clients . financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter - related because of trading , funding , clearing or other relationships . defaults by one or more counterparties , or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions , or the financial services industry generally , could lead to market - wide liquidity disruptions , losses , defaults and related disputes and litigation . our credit risk may also be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us can not be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us , which may occur as a result of events that impact the value of the collateral , such as a sudden change in asset price or fraud . disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress , volatility or illiquidity , and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral . we have concentrations of credit risk , including with respect to our consumer real estate and consumer credit card exposure , as well as our commercial real estate and asset managers and funds portfolios , which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio . declining home price valuations and demand where we have large concentrations could result in increased servicing advances and expenses , defaults , delinquencies or credit losses . the impacts of earthquakes , as well as climate change , such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels , and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters , including droughts , floods , wildfires and hurricanes , could negatively impact collateral , the valuations of home or commercial real estate or our customers ’ ability and/or willingness to pay fees , outstanding loans or afford new products . this could also cause insurability risk and/or increased insurance costs to customers . economic weaknesses , sustained elevated inflation , adverse business conditions , market disruptions , adverse economic or market events , rising interest or capitalization rates , declining asset prices , greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience higher credit losses in our portfolios or write down the value of certain assets . we could also experience continued and long - term negative impacts to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that may be permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences or other industry disruptions . we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations , u.s . states and municipalities . unfavorable economic or political conditions , disruptions to capital markets , currency fluctuations , changes in oil prices , social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit and liquidity risk . liquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell , syndicate or realize the value of our positions , increasing concentrations , which could increase rwa and the credit and market risk associated with our positions . we may be adversely affected by weaknesses in the u.s . housing market . during [XXXX] , the u.s . housing market continued to be impacted by higher mortgage rates , including [XX] - year fixed - rate mortgages that more than doubled from [XXXX] . this has negatively impacted the demand in some cases and underlying collateral for many of our products . additionally , our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market , both of which have slowed due to higher interest rates and reduced affordability . a deeper downturn in the condition of the u.s . housing market could result in significant write - downs of asset values in several asset classes , notably mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) . if the u.s . housing market were to further weaken , the value of real estate could decline , which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses , negatively affect our # # table_start bank of america [XX] # # table_end representations and warranties exposures , and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks , which may result in losses and adversely affect liquidity . we are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market , credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses . fluctuations in asset values or rates or an unanticipated credit event , including unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated , may lead to losses resulting from risks not taken into account or anticipated in the development , structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument . certain derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events , such as a change to our or our affiliates ’ credit ratings , we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other remedial actions , and we could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks . in some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements upon the occurrence of such events . we are also a member of various ccps , which results in credit risk exposure to those ccps . in the event that one or more members of a ccp default on their obligations , we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default . a ccp may also , at its discretion , modify the margin we are required to post , which could mean unexpected and increased funding costs and exposure to that ccp . as a clearing member , we are exposed to the risk of non - performance by our clients for which we clear transactions , which may not be covered by available collateral . additionally , default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses . geopolitical we are subject to numerous political , economic , market , reputational , operational , compliance , legal , regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate . we do business throughout the world , including in emerging markets . economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally , resulting in , among other things , market volatility , reduced market value and economic output . our liquidity and credit risk could be adversely impacted by , and our businesses and revenues derived from non - u.s . jurisdictions are subject to , risk of loss from financial , social or judicial instability , economic sanctions , changes in government leadership , including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise , changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks , expropriation , nationalization and/or confiscation of assets , price controls , high inflation , natural disasters , the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics , capital controls , currency re - denomination risk from a country exiting the eu or otherwise , currency fluctuations , foreign exchange controls or movements ( caused by devaluation or de - pegging ) , unfavorable political and diplomatic developments , oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation . these risks are especially elevated in emerging markets . continued tensions between the u.s . and important trading partners , particularly china , may result in sanctions , further tariff increases or other restrictive actions on cross - border trade , investment and transfer of information technology , which could reduce trade volumes , result in further supply chain disruptions , increase costs for producers , and adversely affect our businesses and revenues , as well as our customers and counterparties , including their credit quality . slowing growth , recessionary conditions , adverse geopolitical conditions and/or political or civil unrest , labor shortages , wage pressures and elevated inflation in certain countries pose challenges , including in the form of volatility in financial markets . foreign exchange rates against the u.s . dollar remain an area of uncertainty and potential volatility , and depreciation could increase our financial risks with clients that deal in non - u.s . currencies but have u.s . dollar - denominated debt . we invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non - u.s . jurisdictions , including emerging markets . revenues from the trading of non - u.s . securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors . furthermore , the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because non - u.s . trading markets , particularly in emerging markets , are generally smaller , less liquid and more volatile than u.s . trading markets . risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations , including our u.s . operations . market and economic disruptions may affect consumer confidence levels and spending , corporate investment and job creation , bankruptcy rates , levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt , economic growth rates and asset values , among other factors . elevated government debt levels raise the risk of volatility , significant valuation changes , political tensions among eu members regarding fiscal policy or defaults on or devaluation of sovereign debt , which could expose us to substantial losses . financial markets have been and may continue to be sensitive to government plans to lower taxes or increase spending . our non - u.s . businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments , securities exchanges and regulators , central banks and other regulatory bodies . in many countries , the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are less predictable , prone to change and uncertainty , and regularly evolving . significant resources are spent on determining , understanding and monitoring foreign laws , rules and regulations , as well as managing our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions . our inability to remain in compliance with local laws and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses , changes to our organizational structure and adversely affect our businesses , reputation and results of operations in that market . we are also subject to complex and extensive u.s . and non - u.s . laws , rules and regulations , which subject us to costs and risks relating to bribery and corruption , know - your - customer requirements , anti - money laundering , embargo programs and economic sanctions , which can vary by jurisdiction and require implementation of complex operational capabilities and compliance programs . non - compliance , including improper implementation , and/or violations could result in an increase in operational and compliance costs , and enforcement actions and civil and criminal penalties against us and individual employees . the increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heighten financial crimes risk . compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes and legal requirements depends on our ability to improve our processes , controls , surveillance , detection and reporting and analytic capabilities . in the u.s . , the government ’s debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of u.s . government defaults on its debt and/or further downgrades to its credit ratings , and prolonged government shutdowns , which could # # table_start [XX] bank of america # # table_end weaken the u.s . dollar , cause market volatility , negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition , including our liquidity . additionally , changes in fiscal , monetary , regulatory and/or foreign policy , including as a result of the election cycle , labor shortages , wage pressures , supply chain disruptions and higher inflation , could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations , organizational structure and results of operations . emerging market currency values and monetary policy settings are particularly sensitive to such changes in u.s . monetary policy . additionally , further restrictive u.s . monetary policy , potentially including further rate increases , could result in additional currency volatility and recessionary conditions in a number of non - u.s . markets . we are also subject to geopolitical risks , including economic sanctions , acts or threats of international or domestic terrorism , including responses by the u.s . or other governments thereto , increased state - sponsored cyberattacks or campaigns , civil unrest and/or military conflicts , including the escalation of tensions between china and taiwan , which could adversely affect business , market trade and general economic conditions abroad and in the u.s . the russia / ukraine conflict and the conflict in the middle east have magnified such risks and resulted in regional instability and adversely impacted commodity and other financial markets , as well as economic conditions , especially in europe . widening regional conflicts resulting in the involvement of neighboring countries and/or north atlantic treaty organization member countries could result in additional economic disruptions , financial market volatility , higher inflation and changes to asset valuations , which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations . business operations a failure in or breach of our operations or information systems , or those of third parties or the financial services industry , could cause disruptions , adversely impact our businesses , results of operations and financial condition , and cause legal or reputational harm . operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our extensive interactions with , and reliance on , third parties and the financial services industry , including the processing and reporting of a large number of transactions in many currencies and jurisdictions . our operations and information systems , which comprise the hardware , software , infrastructure , backup systems and other technology which we own or use to collect , process , maintain , use , share , disseminate or dispose of information , are integral to the performance of our businesses . our operations and information systems and components thereof , and those of our third parties , have been , and in the future could be , ineffective or fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors , including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third party ’s control . such events have adversely affected , and in the future could adversely affect , physical site access of our operations , our ability to process transactions , provide services and perform other operations . short - term or prolonged disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services are possible due to computer , telecommunications , network , utility , electronic or physical infrastructure outages , including from abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms , significant unplanned increases in customer transactions , fraudulent transactions , newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware and software , failure of infrastructure or manual processes , technology project implementation challenges and supply chain disruptions . operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages could also result from events arising from natural disasters , including acute and chronic weather events , such as wildfires , tornadoes , hurricanes and floods , some of which are happening with more frequency and severity , and earthquakes , as well as local or larger scale political or social matters , including civil unrest , terrorist acts and military conflict . we continue to have greater reliance on our and our third parties ’ remote access tools and technology , and employees ’ personal systems and increased data utilization and dependence upon our information systems to operate our businesses remotely , including as a result of evolving customer preferences , which has led to increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by our businesses . effective management of our business continuity increasingly depends on the security , reliability and adequacy of such systems . we also rely on our employees , representatives and third parties in our day - to - day operations , who may , due to illness , unavailability , the emergence or continuation of health emergencies or pandemics , human error , misconduct ( including errors in judgment , malice , fraud or illegal activity ) , malfeasance or a failure or breach of information systems , cause disruptions to our organization and expose us to operational losses , regulatory risk and reputational harm . our and our third parties ’ inability to properly introduce , deploy and manage operational changes , including with regard to internal financial and governance processes , existing products , services and technology , and new product innovations and technology , could also result in additional operational and regulatory risk . regardless of the measures we have taken to implement training , procedures , backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience , our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely , including localized or systemic cyber events that result in information systems outages and unavailability of part or all of the internet , cloud services and/or the financial services industry infrastructure ( including electronic trading and algorithmic platforms and critical banking activities ) . our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third - party systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with respect to our systems . weakness in our third parties ’ processes or controls could impact our ability to deliver products or services to our clients and expose us to compliance and operational risks . there can be no assurance that our business continuity and information security response plans will effectively mitigate our operational risks . any backup systems or manual processes may not process data accurately and/or as quickly or effectively as our primary systems , and some data might not have been backed up . additionally , the speed in which we are able to remediate any failure or disruption of our operations and/or information systems may vary across jurisdictions . we regularly update the information systems we rely on to support our operations and growth as part of our efforts to comply with all applicable laws , rules and regulations globally . this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new or modified information systems and integrating them with existing information systems , including business interruptions . a failure or breach of our or our third parties ’ operations or information systems resulting in disruption to our critical # # table_start bank of america [XX] # # table_end business operations and customer services , a failure to identify or effectively respond to operational risks in a timely manner and/or a failure to continue to deliver our services through an operational disruption could impact the confidentiality , integrity or availability of data and expose us to a number of risks , including market abuse , customer attrition , regulatory , market , privacy and liquidity risk , adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and cause legal , regulatory or reputational harm . the corporation and third parties with whom we interact and/or on whom we rely , are subject to cybersecurity incidents , information and security breaches , and technology failures that have and in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct our businesses , result in the misuse , destruction or disclosure of information , damage our reputation , increase our regulatory and legal risks , result in additional costs or financial losses and/or otherwise adversely impact our businesses and results of operations . our business is highly dependent on the security , controls and efficacy of our information systems , and the information systems of our customers , third parties , the financial services industry and financial data aggregators with whom we interact , on whom we rely or who have access to our customers ' personal or account information . we rely on effective access management and the secure collection , processing , maintenance , use , sharing , dissemination and disposition of information in our and our third parties ’ information systems . our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of , among other things , our prominent size and scale , high - profile brand , geographic footprint and international presence and role in the financial services industry and the broader economy . the proliferation of third - party financial data aggregators and emerging technologies , including our and our third parties ’ use of automation , artificial intelligence ( ai ) and robotics , increases our cybersecurity risks and exposure . we , our employees , customers , regulators and third parties are ongoing targets of an increasing number of cybersecurity threats and cyberattacks . the tactics , techniques and procedures used in cyberattacks are pervasive , sophisticated and designed to evade security measures , including computer viruses , malicious or destructive code ( such as ransomware ) , social engineering ( including phishing , vishing and smishing ) , denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that have and in the future could result in disruptions to our businesses and operations and the loss of funds , including from attempts to defraud us and/or our customers , and impact the confidentiality , integrity or availability of our information , including intellectual property , or that of our employees , customers and third parties . cyberattacks are carried out on a worldwide scale and by a growing number of actors , including organized crime groups , hackers , terrorist organizations , extremist parties , hostile foreign governments , state - sponsored actors , activists , disgruntled employees and other persons or entities , including those involved in corporate espionage . cybersecurity threats and the tactics , techniques and procedures used in cyberattacks change , develop and evolve rapidly , including from emerging technologies , such as ai , machine learning and quantum computing . despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity and resilience of our information systems and implement controls , processes , policies , employee training and other protective measures , we are not able to anticipate and/or detect all cybersecurity threats and incidents and/or develop or implement effective preventive or defensive measures designed to prevent , respond to or mitigate all cybersecurity threats and incidents . internal access management failures could impact the confidentiality , integrity or availability of data . additionally , the failure of our employees to exercise sound judgment and vigilance when targeted with social engineering or other cyberattacks increases our vulnerability . our risk from and exposure to cybersecurity threats and incidents , information and security breaches and technology failures continues to increase due to the acceptance and use of digital banking and other digital products and services , including mobile banking products , and reliance on remote access tools and technology , which have increased our reliance on virtual or digital interactions and a larger number of access points to our information systems that must be secured , and results in greater amounts of information being available for access . greater demand on our information systems and security tools and processes will likely continue . we also face significant third - party technology , cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the large number of customers and third parties with whom we do business , the financial services industry , upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely , including the secure collection , processing , maintenance , use , sharing , dissemination and disposition of customer and other sensitive information , providers of products and/or services , financial counterparties , financial data aggregators , financial intermediaries , such as clearing agents , exchanges and clearing houses , regulators , providers of outsourced infrastructure , such as internet access , cloud service providers and electrical power , and retailers for whom we process transactions . such third - party information systems extend beyond our security and control systems , and such third parties have varying levels of security and cybersecurity resources , expertise , safeguards , controls and capabilities . threat actors may actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weaknesses at our third parties and the relationships of our third parties with us may increase the risk that they are targeted by the same threats we face , and such third parties may be less prepared for such threats . we are also at additional risk resulting from critical third - party information security and open - source software vulnerabilities . we must rely on our third parties to adequately detect and promptly report cybersecurity incidents , and their failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or timely . due to increasing consolidation , interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology and information systems , a cybersecurity threat or incident , information or security breach or technology failure that significantly exposes , degrades , destroys or compromises the information systems or information of one or more financial entities or third parties could adversely impact us and increase the risk of operational failure and loss , as disparate systems need to be integrated , often on an accelerated basis . similarly , any cybersecurity threat or incident , information or security breach or technology failure that significantly exposes , degrades , destroys or compromises our information systems or information could adversely impact third parties and the critical infrastructure of the financial services industry , thereby creating additional risk for us . cybersecurity incidents or information or security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected , and it often takes additional time to determine the scope , extent , amount and type of impact , including information altered , destroyed or otherwise compromised , following which the measures to recover and restore to a business - as - usual state may be difficult to assess . we have spent and expect to continue to spend significant resources to modify and enhance # # table_start [XX] bank of america # # table_end our protective measures , investigate and remediate software and network vulnerabilities , and defend against , detect and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents whether specific to us , a third party , the industry or businesses in general , and enhance our capabilities to respond and recover . while we and our third parties have experienced cybersecurity incidents , information and security breaches and technology failures , as well as adverse impacts from such events , including as described in this risk factor , we have not experienced material losses or other material consequences relating to cybersecurity incidents , information or security breaches or technology failures , whether directed at us or our third parties . however , we expect to continue to experience such events and impacts with increased frequency and severity due to the evolving threat environment , and there can be no assurance that future cybersecurity incidents , information and security breaches and technology failures , including as a result of cybersecurity incidents , information and security breaches and technology failures experienced by our third parties , will not have a material adverse impact on us , including our businesses , results of operations and financial condition . any future cybersecurity incident , information or security breach or technology failure suffered by us or our third parties could result in disruption to our day - to - day business activities , an inability to effect transactions , execute trades , service our customers , manage our exposure to risk , expand our businesses , detect and prevent fraudulent or unauthorized transactions , including transactions impacting our customers , maintain information systems access and business operations and customer services , in the u.s . and/or globally . additionally , we could experience the loss of customers and business opportunities , the withdrawal of customer deposits , the misappropriation , alteration or destruction of our or our third parties ’ intellectual property or confidential information , the unauthorized access to or temporary or permanent loss or theft of personally identifiable information , including of our employees and customers , significant lost revenue , losses and claims brought by third parties , violations of applicable privacy , cybersecurity and other laws , rules and regulations , litigation exposure , economic sanctions , enforcement actions , government fines , penalties or intervention and other negative consequences . although we maintain cyber insurance , there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate . in addition , in the case of any cybersecurity incident , information or security breach or technology failure arising from third - party systems impacting us , any third - party indemnification may not be applicable or sufficient to address the impact of such cybersecurity incidents , information or security breaches or technology failures , including monetary losses of the corporation . the occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely impact our businesses , results of operations , liquidity and financial condition , as well as cause reputational harm , whether such events are actual or perceived . failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer for residential mortgage securitizations , loans owned by other entities and other related losses could adversely impact our reputation , servicing costs or results of operations . we service mortgage loans on behalf of third - party securitization vehicles and other investors . if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer , we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice , which could cause us to lose servicing income . we may also have liability for any failure by us , as a servicer or master servicer , for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance , bad faith , gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties . if any such breach was found to have occurred , it may harm our reputation , increase our servicing costs or losses due to potential indemnification obligations , result in litigation or regulatory action or adversely impact our results of operations . additionally , foreclosures may result in costs , litigation or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation , or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process . we may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure . changes in the structure of and relationship among the gses could adversely impact our business . we rely on the gses to guarantee or purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements . during [XXXX] , we sold approximately $ [X.X] billion of loans to gses , primarily freddie mac ( fhlmc ) . fhlmc and fannie mae ( fnma ) are currently in conservatorship , with the federal housing finance agency ( fhfa ) acting as conservator . in [XXXX] , the treasury department published a proposal to recapitalize fhlmc and fnma and remove them from conservatorship and reduce their role in the marketplace . in january [XXXX] , the treasury department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of fhlmc and fnma and delineated the continued objective to remove the gses from conservatorship . however , we can not predict the future prospects of the gses , timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship , or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the gses in the housing market . if the gses take a reduced role in the marketplace , including by limiting the mortgage products they offer , we could be required to seek alternative funding sources , retain additional loans on our balance sheet , secure funding through the federal home loan bank system , or securitize the loans through private label securitization , which could increase our cost of funds related to the origination of new mortgage loans , increase credit risk and/or impact our capacity to originate new mortgage loans . uncertainty regarding their future and the mbs they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future . these developments could adversely affect our securities portfolios , capital levels , liquidity and results of operations . our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses . our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us . we seek to effectively and consistently identify , measure , monitor , report and control the key types of risk to which we are subject , including strategic , credit , market , liquidity , compliance , operational and reputational risks . risks also may span across multiple key risk types , including cybersecurity risk , climate risk and legal risk . while we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques , including modeling and forecasting , hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses , our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify and measure all risks , including emerging and unknown risks , anticipate the timing and impact of risks , apply effective hedging strategies , make correct assumptions , manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently , identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data and develop risk management models and forecasts to assess and control risk . # # table_start bank of america [XX] # # table_end our ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program , develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the corporation and manage risks associated with third parties , including providers of products and/or services , to allow for effective risk management and help confirm that risks are appropriately considered , evaluated and responded to in a timely manner . uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions , health emergencies and pandemics , heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry , the pace of technological changes , accounting , tax and market developments , the failure of employees , representatives and third parties to comply with our policies and risk framework and the overall complexity of our operations , among other developments , have in the past and may in the future result in a heightened level of risk , including operational , reputational and compliance risk . our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate , manage , control or mitigate risks could result in additional losses and adversely affect our results of operations . regulatory , compliance and legal we are highly regulated and subject to evolving government legislation and regulations and certain settlements , orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time . our businesses are highly regulated and we are subject to evolving and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the u.s . and the laws of the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate , including increasing and complex economic sanctions regimes . these laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses , require changes to our business strategies , limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities , including the products and services we offer , reduce certain fees and rates and/or make our products and services more expensive for our clients . we are also required to file various financial and nonfinancial regulatory reports to comply with laws , rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate , which results in additional compliance risk . we continue to adjust our business and operations , legal entity structure , disclosure and policies , processes , procedures and controls , including with regard to capital and liquidity management , risk management and data management , in an effort to comply with laws , rules and regulations , as well as evolving expectations , guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities , including the department of treasury ( including the internal revenue service ( irs ) and ofac ) , federal reserve , occ , cfpb , financial stability oversight council , fdic , department of labor , sec and cftc in the u.s . , foreign regulators , other government authorities and self - regulatory organizations . further , we expect to become subject to future laws , rules and regulations beyond those currently proposed , adopted or contemplated in the u.s . or abroad , as well as evolving interpretations of existing and future laws , rules and regulations , which may include policies and rulemaking related to fdic assessments , loss allocations between financial institutions and customers with regard to the use of our products and services , including electronic payments , emerging technologies , such as the development and use of ai and machine learning , cybersecurity and data , and further climate risk management and esg reporting , including emissions and sustainability disclosure . the cumulative effect of all of the current and possible future legislation and regulations , as well as related interpretations , on our litigation and regulatory exposure , businesses , operations and profitability remains uncertain and necessitates that we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of existing , prospective and proposed laws , rules and regulations in our business planning and strategies . if these assumptions prove incorrect , we could be subject to increased regulatory , legal and compliance risks and costs , as well as potential reputational harm . also , u.s . and regulatory initiatives abroad may overlap , and non - u.s . regulation and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed u.s . regulations , which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs . our regulators ’ prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions , and they have assumed an active oversight , inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry . regulatory focus is not limited to laws , rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry , but includes other significant laws , rules and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions , including those related to anti - money laundering , anti - bribery , anti - corruption know - your - customer requirements , embargo programs and economic sanctions . we are also subject to laws , rules and regulations in the u.s . and abroad , including the gdpr and ccpa as modified by the cpra , and a number of additional jurisdictions enacting or considering similar laws or amendments to existing laws , regarding privacy and the disclosure , collection , use , sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information , including our employees , customers , suppliers , counterparties and other third parties , the violation of which could result in litigation , regulatory fines , enforcement actions and operational loss . additionally , we are and will continue to be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the u.s . and abroad , which could result in additional costs of compliance , litigation , regulatory fines and enforcement actions . there remains complexity and uncertainty , including potential suspension or prohibition , regarding data transfer because of concerns over compliance with laws , rules and regulations for cross - border flows and transfers of personal data from the european economic area ( eea ) to the u.s . and other jurisdictions outside of the eea , resulting from judicial and regulatory guidance . to the extent that a new eu - u.s . data privacy framework leads to a relaxation of applicable legislation and regulations , regardless of transfer mechanism , challenges are expected from consumer advocacy groups . other jurisdictions , including china and india , have commenced consultation efforts or enacted new legislation or regulations to establish standards for personal data transfers . if cross - border personal data transfers are suspended or restricted or we are required to implement distinct processes for each jurisdiction ’s standards , this could result in operational disruptions to our businesses , additional costs , increased enforcement activity , new contract negotiations with third parties , and/or modification of such data management . as part of their enforcement authority , our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to , among other things , conduct investigations and assess significant civil or criminal monetary fines , penalties or restitution , issue cease and desist orders , suspend or withdraw licenses and authorizations , initiate injunctive action , apply regulatory sanctions or cause us to enter into consent orders . the amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have , in some instances , been substantial and may increase . in some cases , governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions , which could have significant consequences , including reputational harm , loss of customers , restrictions on the ability to access capital markets , and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products . # # table_start [XX] bank of america # # table_end our response to regulators and other government authorities may be time - consuming , expensive and divert management attention from our business . the outcome of any matter , which may last years , may be difficult to predict or estimate . the terms of settlements , orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities have also imposed , or could impose , significant operational and compliance costs on us with respect to enhancements to our procedures and controls , losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against our customers , expansion of our risk and control functions within our lines of business , investment in technology and the hiring of significant numbers of additional risk , control and compliance personnel . if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements , orders or agreements to which we are subject , or , more generally , fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities , we could be required to enter into further settlements , orders or agreements and pay additional fines , penalties or judgments , or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses . improper actions , behaviors or practices by us , our employees or representatives that are illegal , unethical or contrary to our core values could harm us , our shareholders or customers or damage the integrity of the financial markets , and are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions . the complexity of the regulatory and enforcement regimes in the u.s . , coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide , also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings , either by multiple federal and state agencies in the u.s . or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions . actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities . while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs , compliance risks will continue to exist , particularly as we anticipate and adapt to new and evolving laws , rules and regulations and evolving interpretations . we also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk . future legislative or regulatory actions , and any required changes to our business or operations or strategy , or those of third parties upon whom we rely , resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue , impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability , limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities , require us to dispose of certain businesses or assets , require us to curtail certain businesses , affect the value of assets that we hold , necessitate changes in our compensation practices , require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products , or otherwise adversely affect our businesses . we are subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action . we face significant legal risks in our business , with a high volume of claims against us and other financial institutions . the amount of damages , penalties and fines that litigants and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continues to be significant . this includes disputes with consumers , customers and other counterparties . financial institutions , including us , continue to be the subject of claims alleging anti - competitive conduct with respect to various products and markets , including u.s . antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages . as disclosed in note [XX] – commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements , we also face contractual indemnification and loan - repurchase claims arising from alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the sale of residential mortgages by legacy companies , which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans , or make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties . u.s . regulators and government agencies regularly pursue enforcement claims against financial institutions , including us , for alleged violations of law and customer harm , including under the financial institutions reform , recovery , and enforcement act , the federal securities laws , the false claims act , fair lending laws and regulations ( including the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act ) , the fcpa , the bsa , regulations issued by ofac , home mortgage disclosure act , antitrust laws , and consumer protection laws and regulations related to products and services such as overdraft and sales practices , including prohibitions on unfair , deceptive , and/or abusive acts and practices ( udaap ) under the consumer financial protection act and the federal trade commission act , and efta , as well as other enforcement action taken by prudential regulators with respect to safety , soundness and appropriateness of our business practices . such claims may carry significant penalties , restitution and , in certain cases , treble damages , and the ultimate resolution of regulatory inquiries , investigations and other proceedings which we are subject to from time - to - time is difficult to predict . t here is also an increased focus on information security . this includes cybersecurity incidents perpetrated against us , our customers , providers of products and services , counterparties and other third parties , the collection , use and sharing of data , and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data , as well as the development , implementation , use and management of emerging technologies , including ai and machine learning . related litigation or government enforcement , including with regard to compliance with u.s . and global laws , rules and regulations , could subject us to fines , judgments and/or settlements and involve reputational losses . additionally , misconduct by our employees and representatives , including unethical , fraudulent , improper or illegal conduct , the failure to fulfill fiduciary obligations , unfair , deceptive , abusive or discriminatory business practices , or violations of policies , procedures , laws , rules or regulations , including conduct that affects compliance with books and records requirements , have resulted and could result in further litigation and/or government investigations and enforcement actions , and cause significant reputational harm . in particular , we are the subject of litigation and regulatory and government inquiries regarding our processing of electronic payments , our efforts to detect , prevent and address fraud perpetrated against our customers and/or the handling of fraud - related disputes , which could result in fines , judgments , and/or settlements , as well as adversely affect our businesses and strategies due to the treatment of loss allocations between customers and us , all of which could also have an adverse impact on other similar products and services . we are also subject to increasing scrutiny of sustainability - related policies , goals , targets and disclosure , which could result in litigation , regulatory investigations and actions and reputational harm . the global environment of extensive investigations , regulation , regulatory compliance burdens , litigation and # # table_start bank of america [XX] # # table_end regulatory enforcement , combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment , have affected and will likely continue to affect operational and compliance costs and risks , including the adaptation of business strategies and/or limitation or cessation of our ability or feasibility to continue providing certain products and services . lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in and will likely continue to result in judgments , orders , settlements , penalties and fines adverse to us . further , we entered into orders with certain government agencies regarding credit card sales and marketing practices and the representment of non - sufficient fund fees , as well as our participation in implementing government relief measures related to the covid-19 pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs , including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states , and continue to be involved in related litigation that may result in judgments and/or settlements . litigation and investigation costs , substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could adversely affect our businesses , financial condition , including liquidity , and results of operations , and/or cause significant reputational harm . u.s . federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital , total loss - absorbing capacity ( tlac ) , long - term debt or liquidity requirements . we are subject to u.s . regulatory capital and liquidity rules . these rules , among other things , establish minimum requirements to qualify as a well - capitalized institution . if any of our subsidiary insured depository institutions fail to maintain their status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules , the federal reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to well - capitalized status . for the duration of such an agreement , the federal reserve may impose restrictions on our activities . if we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement , the federal reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities , including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the bank holding company act of [XXXX] . capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended . regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements , including tlac and long - term debt requirements , change how regulatory capital or rwa is calculated or increase liquidity requirements . in [XXXX] , u.s . banking regulators issued proposals to revise the calculation of the g - sib surcharge and tlac and long - term debt requirements . our ability to return capital to our shareholders depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers . to the extent that increases occur in our scb , g - sib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer , our returns of capital to shareholders , including common stock dividends and common stock repurchases , could decrease . for example , our g - sib surcharge increased by [XX] bps to [X.X] percent on january [X] , [XXXX] . the federal reserve could also limit or prohibit capital actions , such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock , as a result of economic disruptions or events . as part of its annual ccar , we are subject to extensive regulatory evaluation of capital planning practices by the federal reserve , including stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve . those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results , which may impact our scb level , requiring us to hold additional capital or causing changes in required capital buffers . a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our rwa and our leverage exposure . in july [XXXX] , u.s . banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise several key methodologies for measuring rwa , including a standardized approach for operational risk , revised market risk and credit risk requirements and removal of the use of certain internal models , which would increase our regulatory capital requirements , if adopted as proposed . economic disruptions or events may also cause an increase in our balance sheet , rwa or leverage exposures , increasing required regulatory capital and liquidity amounts . changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets , increase borrowings , issue additional equity or other securities , reduce the amount of common stock repurchases or dividends , cease or alter certain operations , pricing strategies and business activities or hold highly liquid assets , which may adversely affect our results of operations . changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us . accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations . some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult , subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . if assumptions , estimates or judgments are erroneously applied , we could be required to correct and restate prior - period financial statements . accounting standard - setters and those who interpret the accounting standards , including the sec , banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied . these changes may be difficult to predict and could impact the preparation and reporting of our financial statements , including the application of new or revised standards retrospectively , resulting in revisions to prior - period financial statements . we may be adversely affected by changes in u.s . and non - u.s . tax laws and regulations . governmental authorities in the u.s . and/or other countries could further change tax laws in a way that would materially adversely affect us , including changes to the tax cuts and jobs act of [XXXX] and inflation reduction act of [XXXX] . also , new guidelines issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) , which are currently being enacted into law in some oecd countries in which we operate , are expected to impose a [XX] percent global minimum tax on a country - by - country basis . any implementation of and/or change in tax laws and regulations or interpretations of current or future tax laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate , tax liabilities and results of operations . u.s . and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments , interpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority . this could result in additional tax liabilities and interest , penalties , the reduction of certain tax benefits and/or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded , which could be material . additionally , we have u.k . net deferred tax assets ( dta ) which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years . adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors , such as prolonged worsening of europe ’s capital markets or changes in the ability of our u.k . subsidiaries to conduct business in the eu , could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our u.k . net dta . # # table_start [XX] bank of america # # table_end reputation damage to our reputation could harm our businesses , including our competitive position and business prospects . our ability to attract and retain customers , clients , investors and employees is impacted by our reputation . harm to our reputation can arise from various sources , including actual or perceived activities of our officers , directors , employees , other representatives , customers and third parties , including counterparties , such as fraud , misconduct and unethical behavior ( such as employees ’ sales practices ) , adequacy of our ability to detect , prevent and/or respond to fraud perpetrated against our customers , and the handling of related disputes with regard to the use of our products and services , including electronic payments , effectiveness of our internal controls , the fees charged to our customers , including overdraft and non - sufficient fund fees , compensation practices , lending practices , suitability or reasonableness of particular trading or investment strategies , the reliability of our research and models and prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions . our reputation may also be harmed by actual or perceived failure to deliver the products and standards of service and quality expected by our customers , clients and the community , including the overstatement or mislabeling of the environmental benefits of our products , services or transactions , the failure to protect our customers and/or recognize and address customer complaints , compliance failures , technology changes , the implementation , management and/or use of emerging technologies , including quantum computing , ai and machine learning , the failure to maintain effective data management , cybersecurity incidents and information and security breaches affecting us and our third parties , which have occurred and we expect to continue to experience with increased frequency and severity due to the evolving threat environment , prolonged or repeated system outages , the corporation ’s privacy policies , the unintended disclosure of or failure to safeguard personal , proprietary or confidential information , the breach of the corporation ’s fiduciary obligations and handling of the emergence or continuation of health emergencies and pandemics . our reputation may be also be harmed by litigation and/or regulatory matters and their outcomes , relating to the topics discussed above or otherwise . for example , we entered into orders with certain government agencies regarding credit card sales and marketing practices and the representment of non - sufficient fund fees , as well as our processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states , and continue to be involved in related litigation , which may result in judgments and/or settlements . challenges to our esg practices and disclosures , and those of our customers and third parties , including from diverging views regarding esg - related practices and disclosures may also harm our reputation . increases in market interest rates have resulted in increased focus on asset and liability management , including htm and afs securities and related unrealized losses . perceptions of our liquidity and financial condition , actions by the financial services industry generally , or by certain members or individuals in the industry may harm our reputation . adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media by employees , the media or otherwise , whether or not factually correct , may adversely impact our business prospects and results of operations . we are subject to complex and evolving laws , regulations and interpretations regarding fair lending activity , udaap , electronic funds transfers , know - your - customer requirements , data protection and privacy , including the gdpr and the ccpa as modified by the cpra , cross - border data movement , cybersecurity and other matters , as well as evolving and expansive interpretations of these laws and regulations . principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions , and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid . these laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices , or with one another . if personal , confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession , or in the possession of third parties or financial data aggregators , is mishandled , misused or mismanaged , or if we do not timely or adequately address such information , we may face regulatory , legal and operational risks , which could adversely affect our reputation , financial condition and results of operations . we could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest . management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions , obligations and interests with and among our clients . the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services , or result in litigation or enforcement actions , which could adversely affect our business . our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues , such as operational risks , could give rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects , including the attraction and retention of customers and employees . failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions , legal risks and reputational harm , which could , among other consequences , increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions , fines and penalties , and cause us to incur related costs and expenses . other reforms to benchmarks may adversely affect our reputation , business , financial condition and results of operations . risks and challenges associated with reference rate reform , including the potential replacement of benchmark rates with arrs ( e.g. , the expected cessation of bsby ) , could expose us to various financial , operational , supervisory , conduct and legal risk . usage of arrs for impacted benchmarks may vary across or within categories of contracts , products and services , potentially resulting in market fragmentation , decreased trading volumes and liquidity , increased complexity and modeling and operational risks . arrs may have compositions and characteristics that differ from replaced benchmarks , including limited liquidity and less predictable performance over time . any mismatch between the adoption of arrs in loans , securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented , resulting in unanticipated market exposures . transition to arrs may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us , amounts paid on our securities and received and paid on derivatives we have entered into , the value of such loans , securities or derivative instruments , the trading market for such products and contracts , and our effective use of hedging instruments to manage risk . there is no assurance that impacted benchmarks will transition to arrs without delay or potential disputes . the transition of any products using impacted benchmarks ( impacted products ) that do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms may require additional efforts to modify their terms , and may be more challenging to modify if all # # table_start bank of america [XX] # # table_end impacted parties are required to consent to such modification . litigation or other disputes may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of any transition - related legislation or regulations adopted in the u.s . and/or foreign jurisdictions , including if the laws or regulations in jurisdictions overlap . impacted products may contain language giving the corporation discretion to determine the successor rate ( including the applicable spread adjustment ) to the existing benchmark . we may face a risk of litigation , disputes or other actions from customers , counterparties , investors or others based on various claims , for example , that we incorrectly interpreted or enforced contract provisions , failed to appropriately communicate the transition effects of arrs to existing and future products , treated affected parties unfairly or made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of our clients , engaged in anti - competitive behavior or unlawfully manipulated markets or benchmarks . arr - based products that we develop , launch and/or support may perform differently from impacted products during times of economic stress , adverse or volatile market conditions and across the credit and economic cycle , which may impact the value , return on and profitability of our arr - based assets . new financial products linked to arrs may have additional legal , financial , accounting , tax , operational , market , compliance , reputational , competitive or other risks to us , our customers and other market participants . scrutiny by banking regulators in the u.s . and globally on transition plans , preparations and readiness could result in regulatory action , litigation and/or the need to change the products offered by our businesses . we face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry . we operate in a highly competitive environment and experience intense competition from local and global bank and nonbank financial institutions and new entrants in domestic and foreign markets . there is increasing pressure to provide products and services on more attractive terms , including lower fees and higher interest rates on deposits , and lower cost investment strategies , which may impact our ability to effectively compete . the current and changing regulatory environment may also create competitive disadvantages , including from more stringent regulatory requirements applicable to the corporation . emerging technologies and the growth of e - commerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions , made it easier for non - depository institutions to offer traditional banking products and services and allowed non - traditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internet - based financial solutions and services , including electronic securities trading with low or no fees and commissions , marketplace lending , financial data aggregation and payment processing services , including real - time payment platforms . further , clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky as an alternative to traditional banking products . increased competition may reduce our market share , net interest margin and revenues from our fee - based products and services and negatively affect our earnings , including by pressuring us to lower pricing or credit standards , requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology and/or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us . our inability to adapt our business strategies , products and services could harm our business . we rely on a diversified mix of businesses that deliver a broad range of financial products and services through multiple distribution channels . our success depends on our and our third - party providers ’ ability to timely adapt our business strategies , products and services and their respective features , including available payment processing services and technology to rapidly evolving industry standards and consumer preferences . our strategies could be further impacted by macroeconomic stress , widespread health emergencies or pandemics , cyberattacks , and military conflicts or other significant geopolitical events . the widespread adoption and rapid evolution of emerging technologies , including analytic capabilities , self - service digital trading platforms and automated trading markets , internet services , and digital assets , such as central bank digital currencies , cryptocurrencies ( including stablecoins ) , tokens and other cryptoassets that utilize distributed ledger technology ( dlt ) , as well as payment , clearing and settlement processes that use dlt , create additional strategic risks , could negatively impact our ability to compete and require substantial expenditures to the extent we were to modify or adapt our existing products and services . as such new technologies evolve and mature , our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted , including as a result of the introduction of new competitors to the payment ecosystem and increased volatility in deposits and/or significant long - term reduction in deposits ( i.e. , financial disintermediation ) . also , we may not be as timely or successful in accurately assessing the competitive landscape and developing or introducing new products and services , integrating new products or services into our existing offerings , responding , managing or adapting to changes in consumer behavior , preferences , spending , investing and/or saving habits , achieving market acceptance of our products and services , reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining customers . our or our third - party providers ’ inability or resistance to timely innovate or adapt its operations , products and services to evolving regulatory and market environments , industry standards and consumer preferences could result in service disruptions and harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation . we could suffer operational , reputational and financial harm if our models fail to properly anticipate and manage risk . we use models extensively to forecast losses , project revenue and expenses , assess and control our operations and financial condition , assist in capital planning , manage liquidity and measure , forecast and assess capital and liquidity requirements for credit , market , operational and strategic risks . under our enterprise model risk policy , model risk management is required to perform model oversight , including independent validation before initial use , ongoing monitoring reviews through outcomes analysis and benchmarking , and periodic revalidation . however , models are subject to inherent limitations from simplifying assumptions , uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes , and emerging risks from applications that rely on ai or machine learning . our models may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns , extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior and liquidity , especially during severe market downturns or stress events ( e.g. , geopolitical or pandemic events ) , which could limit their effectiveness and require timely recalibration . the models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators , which may not be representative of the next downturn and would magnify the limitations inherent in using historical data to # # table_start [XX] bank of america # # table_end manage risk . market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk . our models may also be adversely impacted by human error and may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee and review them at regular intervals and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes , they contain erroneous data , assumptions , valuations , formulas or algorithms or our applications running the models do not perform as expected . regardless of the steps we take to help confirm effective controls , governance , monitoring and testing , and implement new technology and automated processes , we could suffer operational , reputational and financial harm , including funding or liquidity shortfalls , if models fail to properly anticipate and manage risks . failure to properly manage data may result in our inability to manage risk and business needs , errors in our operations , critical reporting and strategic decision - making , inaccurate reporting and non - compliance with laws , rules and regulations . we rely on our ability to manage and process data in an accurate , timely and complete manner , including capturing , transporting , aggregating , using , transmitting data externally , and retaining and protecting data appropriately . while we continually update our policies , programs , processes and practices and implement emerging technologies , such as automation , ai , machine learning and robotics , our data management processes may not be effective and are subject to weaknesses and failures , including human error , data limitations , process delays , system failure or failed controls . failure to properly manage data effectively in an accurate , timely and complete manner may adversely impact its quality and reliability and our ability to manage current and emerging risk , produce accurate financial and/or nonfinancial , regulatory , operational and esg reporting , detect or surveil potential misconduct or non - compliance with laws , rules and regulations , and to manage changing business needs , strategic decision - making , resolution strategy and operations . the failure to establish and maintain effective , efficient and controlled data management could adversely impact our ability to develop our products and relationships with customers , increase regulatory risk and operational losses , and damage our reputation . our operations , businesses and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts related to climate change . climate change and related environmental sustainability matters present short - term and long - term risks . the physical risks include an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters , including floods , wildfires , hurricanes and tornados , and chronic longer - term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels . such disasters and effects could adversely impact our facilities , employees and customers ’ ability to repay outstanding loans , disrupt the operations of us and our customers or third parties , cause supply chain or distribution network disruptions , damage collateral and/or result in market volatility , rapid deposit outflows or drawdowns of credit facilities , the deterioration of the value of collateral or insurance shortfalls . there is also increasing risk related to the transition to a low - carbon economy . changes in consumer preferences or financial condition of our customers and counterparties , market pressures , advancements in technology and additional legislation , regulatory , compliance and legal requirements could alter our strategic planning and the scope of our existing businesses , limit our ability to pursue certain business activities and offer certain products and services , amplify credit and market risks , negatively impact asset values , require capital expenditures and changes in technology and markets , including supply chain and insurance availability and cost , increase expenses , impact capital requirements and adversely impact our results of operations . in particular , there is an increasing global regulatory focus , including state , federal and non - u.s . jurisdictions , on climate change resulting in new or heightened regulatory requirements , with potential jurisdictional divergence , which is expected to increase our legal , compliance and public disclosure risks and costs in the u.s . and globally . our climate change strategies , policies , and disclosures , our ability to achieve our climate - related goals , targets and commitments and/or the environmental or climate impacts attributable to our products , services or transactions will likely result in heightened legal and compliance risk and could result in reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment , regulatory scrutiny , litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence . due to divergent views of stakeholders , we are at increased risk that any action , or lack thereof , by us concerning our response to climate change will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders , which could adversely impact our reputation and businesses . our ability to meet our climate - related goals , targets and commitments , including our goal to achieve certain greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions targets by [XXXX] and net zero ghg emissions in our financing activities , operations and supply chain before [XXXX] , is subject to risks and uncertainties , many of which are outside of our control , such as technological advances , clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors , public policies and better emissions data reporting , and ongoing engagement with customers , suppliers , investors , government officials and other stakeholders . due to the evolving nature of climate - related risks , which are expected to increase over time , it is difficult to predict , identify , monitor and effectively mitigate climate - related risks and uncertainties . furthermore , there are and will continue to be challenges related to the availability and capturing , measuring , verifying , analyzing and disclosing climate - related data , including data obtained from third parties , which may result in legal , compliance and/or reputational harm . our ability to attract , develop and retain qualified employees is critical to our success , business prospects and competitive position . our performance and competitive position is heavily dependent on the talents , development and efforts of highly skilled individuals . competition for qualified personnel is intense from within and outside the financial services industry . our competitors include global institutions and institutions subject to different compensation and hiring regulations than those imposed on u.s . institutions and financial institutions . also , our ability to attract , develop and retain employees could be impacted by changing workforce concerns , expectations , practices and preferences ( including remote work ) , and increasing labor shortages and competition for labor , which could increase labor costs . in order to attract and retain qualified personnel , we must provide market - level compensation . as a large financial and banking institution , we are and may become subject to additional limitations on compensation practices by the federal reserve , the occ , the fdic and other regulators globally , which may or may not affect our competitors . furthermore , because a substantial portion of compensation paid to many of our employees is long - term equity - based awards based on the value of our common stock , declines in our profitability or outlook could adversely affect the ability to attract and retain employees . if we are unable to continue to attract , develop and retain qualified individuals , our business prospects and competitive position could be adversely affected . # # table_start bank of america [XX] # # table_end"

k , quarterly reports on form [XX] - q , current reports on form [X] - k , and amendments to those reports , are available for free at as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) . they are also available for free on the sec ’s website at [X] . description of business general we are a leading financial services company that provides a diversified set of banking , investment and mortgage products and services , as well as consumer and commercial finance , through banking locations and offices , the internet ( and other distribution channels to individuals , businesses and institutions in all [XX] states , the district of columbia and in countries outside the u.s . we provide consumer financial products and services including checking and savings accounts , credit and debit cards , and auto , mortgage and home equity , and small business lending . in addition , we offer financial planning , private banking , investment management , and fiduciary services . we also provide financial solutions to businesses through products and services including traditional commercial loans and lines of credit , letters of credit , asset - based lending and leasing , trade financing , treasury management , and investment banking services . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had four reportable operating segments for management reporting purposes : consumer banking and lending ; commercial banking ; corporate and investment banking ; and wealth and investment management . the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments . human capital our people are what set wells fargo apart and are critical to our success . wells fargo continues to invest in our employees by offering market competitive compensation , career - development opportunities , a broad array of benefits , and strong work - life programs . # # table_start [X] we do not control this website . wells fargo has provided this link for your convenience , but does not endorse and is not responsible for the content , links , privacy policy , or security policy of this website . # # table_end we have set common expectations for everyone at the company . these expectations guide how we lead ourselves , collaborate with our colleagues , and make decisions . the following expectations apply to everyone at wells fargo , at every level , and in every role : • embrace candor • do what ’s right • be great at execution • learn and grow • champion diversity and inclusion • build high - performing teams ( for managers ) at december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had approximately [XXX,XXX] active employees , with approximately [XX] % of employees based in the united states . compensation and benefits . wells fargo 's compensation program is linked to performance management and is designed to promote prudent risk management and reinforce its culture and operating standards . the compensation principles include : • pay for performance : compensation is linked to company , line of business , and individual performance , including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long - term value consistent with the interests of shareholders . • promote effective risk management : compensation promotes effective risk management and discourages imprudent or excessive risk - taking . • attract and retain talent : people are one of wells fargo 's competitive advantages ; therefore , compensation helps attract , motivate , and retain people with the skills , talent , and experience to drive superior long - term company performance . in addition , we provide all eligible full- and part - time employees ( and their eligible dependents , as applicable ) with a comprehensive set of benefits designed to protect their physical , emotional , and financial health to help them make the most of their well - being . pay equity review . wells fargo is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices . we have conducted an annual pay equity review through engagement with a third - party consultant for a number of years . the pay equity review compares the compensation of women to men globally and u.s . minorities versus u.s . non - minorities taking into account factors such as role , level , tenure , and geography . we may make adjustments to compensation in the event the review identifies gaps . the year - end [XXXX] review showed that women at wells fargo continue to earn more than [XX] cents for every $ [X] earned by their male peers , and u.s . employees that are racially / ethnically diverse earn more than [XX] cents for every $ [X] earned by their caucasian / white peers . promoting diversity , equity and inclusion . meeting the increasingly diverse needs of wells fargo ’s global customer base is critical to our company ’s long - term growth and success . wells fargo values and promotes diversity , equity and inclusion ( de&i ) in every aspect of our business . we are dedicated to recruitment and career development practices that support our employees and promote diversity throughout our workforce , including leadership positions . we developed de&i principles , which are informed by affirmative action and equal employment opportunity policies , for our operating committee . our head of diverse segments , representation and inclusion reports directly to our ceo and is responsible for advancing our de&i efforts . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , our global workforce was [XX] % female and [XX] % male , and our u.s . workforce was [XX] % female and [XX] % male . our u.s . workforce was [XX] % caucasian / white and [XX] % racially / ethnically diverse . employee learning and development . we invest in the development of our employees and managers . we believe that when our employees feel properly supported , engaged , and confident in their skills , they are more effective and can provide an even better customer experience . during [XXXX] , we invested approximately $ [XXX] million in a variety of employee learning and development programs , including functional training , regulatory compliance , leadership and professional development , and early talent development programs . in addition , we provided tuition reimbursement for approximately [X,XXX] employees in [XXXX] . work - life programs . wells fargo offers many benefits , programs , and work arrangements intended to provide employees with flexibility and work - life balance . for example , employees in certain non - customer - facing roles have flexibility to work up to two days a week remotely , and are expected to spend a minimum of three days a week in the office . expectations for other roles , including customer - facing , operations , contact center , and non - u.s . based employees , vary by business need . competition the financial services industry is highly competitive . our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks , savings and loan associations , credit unions , finance companies , mortgage banking companies , insurance companies , investment banks and mutual fund companies . they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses , private equity firms and online lending companies , as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies . many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures . securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions . combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business . the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services . these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties . regulation and supervision we describe below , and in note [XX] ( regulatory capital requirements and other restrictions ) to financial statements in the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders , the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us . banking statutes , regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies , as well as non - u.s . governments and financial regulators , and a change in them , including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented , could have a material effect on our business . the regulatory framework applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies ( bhcs ) is intended to protect depositors , federal deposit insurance funds , consumers and the banking system as a whole , and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the company . statutes , regulations , and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services , make acquisitions , and pay dividends on our capital stock . they may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks , maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management , and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of assessments or a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions . see the “ regulatory matters ” and “ risk factors ” sections in the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders for additional information . general parent bank holding company . as a bhc , the parent is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to inspection , examination and supervision by its primary regulator , the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve board or frb ) . the parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of [XXXX] , as amended , and the securities exchange act of [XXXX] , as amended , both as administered by the sec . as a company with securities listed on the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) , the parent is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies . subsidiary banks . our subsidiary national banks , and their subsidiaries , are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) and also by the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) , the frb , the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) , the sec and the commodities futures trading commission ( cftc ) . the non - u.s . branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective financial regulators as well as by the occ and the frb . non - u.s . subsidiaries of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business . nonbank subsidiaries . many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies . our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies , as well as the frb . our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the sec , the financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ) and , in some cases , the cftc and the municipal securities rulemaking board , and state securities regulators . our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states as well as non - u.s . countries in which they conduct business or operate . parent bank holding company activities “ financial in nature ” requirement . we became a financial holding company effective march [XX] , [XXXX] . we continue to maintain our status as a bhc for purposes of various frb regulations . as a bhc that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company pursuant to the bhc act , we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature . “ financial in nature ” activities include securities underwriting , dealing , and market making ; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies ; insurance underwriting and agency ; merchant banking ; and activities that the frb , in consultation with the secretary of the u.s . treasury , determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity . “ complementary activities ” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk . frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company ( other than a bhc , bank or savings association ) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature , as determined by the frb . prior notice to the frb may be required , however , if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of $ [XX] billion or more . prior frb approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than [X] % of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bhc , bank or savings association . in addition , the frb has implemented a final rule under the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) that also prohibits our ability to merge , acquire all or substantially all of the assets of , or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed [XX] % of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies . because we are a financial holding company , if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the community reinvestment act of [XXXX] , as amended ( cra ) , of less than satisfactory , we will be prohibited , until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better , from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bhcs , banks or savings associations , except that we could engage in new activities , or acquire companies engaged in activities , that are closely related to banking under the bhc act . cra performance is also considered by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches . in addition , if the frb finds that the company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed , we would be required to enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions . until corrected , we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the bhc act without prior frb approval . if we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period , the frb could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or , in the alternative , to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act . interstate banking . under the riegle - neal interstate banking and branching act ( riegle - neal act ) , a bhc may acquire banks in states other than its home state , subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time , not to exceed five years , and the requirement that the bhc not control , prior to or following the proposed acquisition , more than [XX] % of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or , unless the acquisition is the bank holding company ’s initial entry into the state , more than [XX] % of such deposits in the state ( or such lesser or greater amount set by the state ) . the riegle - neal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines , subject to the same deposit limits noted above , thereby creating interstate branches . banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states . regulatory approval . in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition , federal banking regulators will consider , among other factors , the effect of the acquisition on competition , financial condition , and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels , the competence , experience , and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations , the convenience and needs of the communities to be served , including the acquiring institution ’s record of compliance under the cra , the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the united states banking system . dividend restrictions the parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries . a significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the parent ’s subsidiaries . various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the parent ’s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval . federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the parent ’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses . the payment of dividends , depending on the financial condition of the bank in question , could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice . similarly , as part of their supervisory authority , regulators may limit or restrict subsidiary capital distributions . the ability of the parent ’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently , and could be further , influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements . for information about the restrictions applicable to the parent ’s subsidiary banks , see note [XX] ( regulatory capital requirements and other restrictions ) to financial statements in the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders . furthermore , under a support agreement dated june [XX] , [XXXX] , as amended and restated on june [XX] , [XXXX] ( the “ support agreement ” ) , among the parent , wfc holdings , llc , an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the parent ( the “ ihc ” ) , wells fargo bank , n.a . , wells fargo securities , llc , wells fargo clearing services , llc , and certain other subsidiaries of the parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan , the ihc may be restricted from making dividend payments to the parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers , or if the parent ’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the u.s . bankruptcy code . any such restriction could materially and adversely impact the parent ’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations , as well as its ability to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock . see the “ regulatory matters ” and “ risk factors ” sections of the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders for additional information on the support agreement . in addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us , the frb requires large bhcs , including wells fargo , to submit annual capital plans describing planned capital distributions , such as the payment of dividends . large bhcs , like wells fargo , and their insured depository institutions also must comply with various capital requirements , including the reforms known as basel iii , as well as rules that establish leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements . we are also subject to the frb 's rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those u.s . banking organizations , such as the company , that are designated as global systemically important banks ( g - sibs ) . the failure to meet any of these requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions . in addition , the frb ’s enhanced supervision regulations for large bhcs , like wells fargo , impose capital distribution restrictions , including on the payment of dividends , upon the occurrence of capital , stress test , risk management , or liquidity risk management triggers . for more information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries , see the “ capital management , ” “ regulatory matters ” and “ risk factors ” sections of the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders . holding company structure transfer of funds from subsidiary banks . the parent ’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries ( including affiliates ) in so - called “ covered transactions . ” in general , covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit , investments and asset purchases , as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate . unless an exemption applies , covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to [XX] % of the subsidiary bank ’s capital and surplus and , with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate , to [XX] % of the subsidiary bank ’s capital and surplus . also , loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral . a bank ’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm ’s length terms . the company is also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers , directors and principal shareholders of the parent and its subsidiary banks . source of strength . the frb has a policy that a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and , under appropriate circumstances , to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank . this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide the support . the occ may order an assessment of the parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired . if the parent failed to pay the assessment within three months , the occ could order the sale of the parent ’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency . depositor preference . in the event of the “ liquidation or other resolution ” of an insured depository institution , the claims of deposits payable in the united states ( including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors ) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution . if an insured depository institution fails , claims of insured and uninsured u.s . depositors , along with claims of the fdic , will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors , including the parent , and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution ’s non - u.s . offices . liability of commonly controlled institutions . the company ’s subsidiaries include banks in the u.s . , such as wells fargo bank , n.a . , that are insured by the fdic . under the federal deposit insurance act , insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred , or reasonably expected to be incurred , by the fdic due to the default of an insured depository institution controlled by the same bhc , and for any assistance provided by the fdic to an insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bhc . “ default ” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver . “ in danger of default ” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance . dodd - frank act the dodd - frank act and the numerous rules to implement its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of large bhcs , such as wells fargo . this includes , among other things , rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bhc ; enhance consumer protections ; prohibit proprietary trading ; and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bhcs regarding risk - based capital and leverage , risk and liquidity management , stress testing , and recovery and resolution planning . the dodd - frank act , including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules , has affected , and we expect will continue to affect , most of our businesses in some way , either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks , capital or liquidity . for more information about the dodd - frank act and its effect on our business , see the “ regulatory matters ” and “ risk factors ” sections of the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders . capital and liquidity requirements and capital planning the company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by federal banking regulators . the capital rules , among other things , establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures . federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large bhcs , like wells fargo , and their insured depository institutions , as well as a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio . the frb has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long - term debt a g - sib must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency , often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity . from time to time , federal banking regulators propose changes and amendments to , and issue interpretations of , risk - based capital requirements and related reporting instructions . in addition , the frb closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on frb determinations . such determinations , proposals or interpretations could , if implemented in the future , affect our reported capital ratios and net risk - adjusted assets . as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions , the federal deposit insurance act ( fdi act ) requires federal banking regulators to establish certain non - capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator . the standards relate generally to operations and management , asset quality , interest rate exposure , executive compensation and risk management . federal banking regulators are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards . the fdi act requires federal banking regulators to take “ prompt corrective action ” with respect to fdic - insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements . a depository institution ’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors , as established by regulation . in addition , the frb ’s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions , including dividends and share repurchases , by certain bhcs , including wells fargo . federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions . for more information on our capital requirements and planning , see the “ capital management ” section of the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders . deposit insurance assessments the company ’s subsidiaries include banks , such as wells fargo bank , n.a . , that are insured by the fdic . through the deposit insurance fund ( dif ) maintained by the fdic , the fdic insures the deposits of our insured banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the dif through assessments on member banks . to maintain the dif , member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate . the fdic has adopted a comprehensive , long - range plan for dif management , targeting a designated reserve ratio of [X] % . for more information about our fdic deposit assessment expense , see note [XX] ( revenue and expenses ) to financial statements in the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders . the fdic may terminate a depository institution ’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution ’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any applicable law , regulation , order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution ’s regulatory agency . the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could result in a significant loss of deposits and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings , depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved . fiscal and monetary policies our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies . we are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the frb , which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states . among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are ( a ) conducting open market operations in united states government securities , ( b ) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions , ( c ) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions ’ deposits , and ( d ) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates . these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits , as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits . the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . privacy provisions of the gramm - leach - bliley act and restrictions on affiliate marketing federal banking regulators , as required under the gramm - leach - bliley act ( glb act ) , have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties . the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and , in some circumstances , allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties . the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors . federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period , after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers , before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies . sarbanes - oxley act of [XXXX] the sarbanes - oxley act of [XXXX] ( sarbanes - oxley ) implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures designed to increase corporate responsibility , provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies , and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws . we are subject to sarbanes - oxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of [XXXX] . among other things , sarbanes - oxley and/or its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee , imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors ( including restrictions on the types of non - audit services our auditors may provide to us ) , imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer , expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders , required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting , and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting . usa patriot act the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of [XXXX] ( usa patriot act ) is intended to strengthen the ability of u.s . law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts . the usa patriot act has significant implications for depository institutions , brokers , dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money . the usa patriot act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to anti‑money laundering , economic sanctions , suspicious activities , and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers . the usa patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition . future legislation or regulation economic , market and political conditions during the past several years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the u.s . and abroad affecting the financial services industry , as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators . further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways . such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business , affect our compensation structure , restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks , savings associations , credit unions , and other financial institutions . we can not predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and , if enacted , the effect that they , or any implementing regulations , would have on our business , results of operations or financial condition . additional information additional information in response to this item [X] can be found in the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders under “ financial review ” and under “ financial statements . ” that information is incorporated into this item by reference . # # table_start",item 1a . risk factors # # table_end information in response to this item 1a can be found in this report under item [X] and in the [XXXX] annual report to shareholders under “ financial review – risk factors . ” that information is incorporated into this item by reference . # # table_start

operated and most licensed stores in north america , china , japan and many of our other markets in our international segment . stored value cards can also be obtained online , via the starbucks ® mobile app and through other u.s . and international retailers . customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the starbucks mobile app in participating stores . in nearly all markets , including the u.s . and canada , customers who register their starbucks cards are automatically enrolled in the starbucks rewards program . registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ( “ stars ” ) earned . in addition to using their starbucks cards , starbucks rewards members can earn stars by paying with cash , credit or debit cards , or selected mobile wallets at all company - operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in north america . using the mobile order and pay functionality of the starbucks mobile app , customers can also place orders in advance for pick - up at certain participating locations in several markets . refer to note [X] , summary of significant accounting policies and estimates , included in item [X] of part ii of this [XX] - k , for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program . licensed stores revenues from our licensed stores accounted for [XX] % of total net revenues in fiscal [XXXX] . licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company - operated stores . under the licensed model , starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales . licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments , which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model . in our licensed store operations , we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience . licensees provide improved , and at times the only , access to desirable retail space . most licensees are prominent retailers with in - depth market knowledge and access . as part of these arrangements , we sell coffee , tea , food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees . we also sell certain equipment , such as coffee brewers and espresso machines , to our licensees for use in their operations . licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company - operated stores . in a limited number of international markets , we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores . licensed store data for the fiscal year -

to - drink beverages to customers outside of our company - operated and licensed stores , as well as royalties received from nestlé under the global coffee alliance and other collaborative partnerships . product supply starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages . to help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards , we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing , roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations . nestlé controls distribution of starbucks packaged coffee products outside of starbucks stores through the global coffee alliance , and in some cases , also roasts and packages these products . we purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee - producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single - origin coffees . the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility . although most coffee trades in the commodity market , high - altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “ c ” coffee commodity price . both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase . supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries , including weather , water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain , natural disasters , crop disease and pests , general increase in farm inputs and costs of production , inventory levels and political and economic conditions . climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors . price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market , including hedge funds and commodity index funds . in addition , green coffee prices have been affected in the past , and may be affected in the future , by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies . we buy coffee using fixed - price and price - to - be - fixed purchase commitments , depending on market conditions , to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee . we also utilize forward contracts , futures contracts and collars to hedge “ c ” price exposure under our price - to - be - fixed green coffee contracts and our long - term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed - price and price - to - be - fixed contracts are not yet available . total purchase commitments , together with existing inventory , are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal [XXXX] . we depend upon our relationships with coffee producers , outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee . we believe , based on relationships established with our suppliers , the risk of non - delivery on such purchase commitments is remote . to help ensure the future supply of high - quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry , starbucks operates ten farmer support centers , including our china farmer support center located in the yunnan province of this high - growth market . farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts . in addition to coffee , we also purchase significant amounts of dairy , particularly fluid milk , and to a lesser degree , plant - based dairy - free alternative products , such as oat milk and almond milk , to support the needs of our company - operated stores . we believe , based on relationships established with our dairy and plant - based dairy - free suppliers , that the risk of non - delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant - based dairy - free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote . products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready - to - drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers , usually under long - term supply contracts . food products , such as pastries , breakfast sandwiches and lunch items , are purchased from national , regional and local sources . we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products , such as cups and cutlery , from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations . we are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste . we believe , based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers , that the risk of non - delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote . competition our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops . we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality , brand reputation , service and convenience , as well as price . we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick - service restaurant sector and the ready - to - drink coffee beverage market , in addition to both well - established and start - up companies in many international markets . we also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores . our coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores , warehouse clubs , specialty retailers , convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market . trademarks , copyrights , patents and domain names starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the u.s . and in other countries throughout the world . some of our trademarks , including starbucks , the starbucks logo , starbucks reserve and frappuccino are of material importance . the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country . however , trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained . we own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging , promotional materials , in - store graphics and training materials . we also hold patents on certain products , systems and designs which have an average remaining useful life of approximately five years . in addition , starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names , including “ starbucks.com , ” “ starbucks.net ” and “ starbucksreserve.com . ” seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations , of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income . additionally , as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season , we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year . however , since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the card , the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced . as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations , results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year . government regulation as a company with global operations , we are subject to the laws and regulations of the united states and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules , reporting obligations and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies , which may differ among jurisdictions . in addition , changes to such laws , regulations , rules , reporting obligations and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures , results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods . available information starbucks annual report on form [XX] -

k , including the management ’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section , the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes . if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur , our business , financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected . the considerations and risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well . moreover , the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business , reputation , financial condition , results of operations or the trading price of our common stock . it is not possible for management to predict all such risks , nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on starbucks business or the extent to which any risk , or combination of risks , may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward - looking statements . given these risks and uncertainties , investors should not place undue reliance on forward - looking statements as a prediction of actual results . risks related to brand relevance and brand execution • our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results . we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products , for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs . the starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world , and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies . to be successful in the future , particularly outside of the u.s . where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less well - known , we believe we must preserve , grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels . brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities . erosion of trust in our brand value can be caused by isolated or recurring incidents originating both from us or our business partners , or from external events . such incidents can potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results . incidents that can erode trust in our brand value include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws , contaminated food , product recalls , store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases , safety - related incidents or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section . the impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity , including rapidly through social or digital media ( including for malicious reasons ) or result in litigation . consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if we , our employees , licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products , act or are perceived to act in an unethical , illegal , racially - biased , unequal , inequitable or socially irresponsible manner , including with respect to the sourcing , content or sale of our products , service and treatment of customers at starbucks stores , treatment of employees , including our responses to unionization efforts , or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes . furthermore , if we are not effective in making sufficient progress toward our social and environmental program goals or in executing on our reinvention plan , consumer trust in our brand may suffer , and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation . additionally , if we fail to comply with laws and regulations , take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets , including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment , our brand value may be diminished . the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on making sufficient progress toward our social and environmental program goals as well as the successful execution of the reinvention plan , each of which requires company - wide coordination and alignment . we are working to manage risks and costs to us , our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources . these risks include any increased public focus , including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations , on these and other environmental sustainability matters , including packaging and waste , animal health and welfare , deforestation and land use . these risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments or set goals and take actions to meet them , which could expose us to market , operational and execution costs or risks . some third parties may object to the scope or nature of our social and environmental program initiatives or goals , or any revisions to these initiatives or goals , which could give rise to negative responses by governmental actors ( such as retaliatory legislative treatment ) or consumers ( such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns ) that could adversely affect our brand value . • we may not be successful in our marketing , promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies . our continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing , promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences . we operate in a complex and costly marketing , promotional and advertising environment . competition to attract and retain high - quality marketing partners and endorsers has increased . our decisions to collaborate or to cease collaborating with certain endorsers or marketing partners in light of actions taken or statements made by them could seriously harm our brand image with consumers and , as a result , could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition . our marketing , promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching consumers in the way we intend . our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising , promotional and marketing resources across different channels , including digital , allows us to reach consumers effectively and efficiently , and in ways that are meaningful to them . if the advertising , promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful , or are not as successful as those of our competitors , our sales and market share could decrease . finally , consumers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations , as well as the alignment of starbucks actions with its stated mission , values and promises . an inability to meet consumer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results . risks related to our business • if our business partners and third - party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments , it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer . our global business strategy , including our plans for new stores , branded products and other initiatives , relies significantly on a variety of business partners , including licensee and joint venture relationships , third - party manufacturers , distributors and retailers , particularly for our entire global channel development business . licensees , retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food , beverage and other products directly to customers . we believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company - operated store , so we provide training and support to , and monitor the operations of , certain of these licensees and other business partners . however , the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control , including financial constraints or solvency , adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance , labor shortages and other factors . we do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices . we also source our food , beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners , and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly . we do not monitor the quality of non - starbucks products served by foodservice operators we have authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business . additionally , inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets , as well as failure to protect our intellectual property , can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results . • incidents involving food or beverage - borne illnesses , tampering , adulteration , contamination or mislabeling , whether or not accurate , as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products , could harm our business . instances or reports , whether true or not , of unclean water supply or food - safety issues , such as food or beverage - borne illnesses , tampering , adulteration , contamination or mislabeling , either during growing , manufacturing , packaging , storing or preparation , have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing , grocery and quick - service restaurant sectors . any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims , litigation ( including class actions ) , temporary store closures , or other adverse consequences . clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee , tea and other beverages , as well as ice for our cold beverages , and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited , particularly in some international locations . we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration , which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error . we also face risk by relying on third - party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores . the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defects in these products . there is greater risk from those we do not monitor , or do not monitor as closely . furthermore , stemming from the covid-19 pandemic , there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls . potential food safety incidents , whether at our stores or involving our business partners , could lead to wide public exposure , which could materially harm our business . in addition , instances of food or beverage - safety issues , even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors ( regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors ) , could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general . a decrease in customer traffic as a result of food - safety concerns or negative publicity , or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores , product recalls , viral - contaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beverage - safety claims or litigation , could materially harm our business and results of operations . • we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth , which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results . there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns , which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results . these strategic initiatives , which include our reinvention plan , are designed to create growth , improve our results of operations and drive long - term shareholder value , and include : • being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience ; • building our leadership position around coffee ; • driving convenience , brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile , loyalty , delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally ; • simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers ; • increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats , including the accelerated development of alternative store formats ( such as starbucks pickup stores , starbucks now stores and curbside pickup ) ; • adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors as a result of the covid-19 pandemic , changing economic conditions , increased global interest rates and inflation ; • moving to a more licensed store model in certain markets and a more company - operated model in other markets ; • creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings , including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup ; • continuing the global growth of our channel development business through our supply , distribution and licensing agreements with nestlé and other channel development business partners ; • delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business ; • working to address the potential effects of climate change and the sustainability of our business ; and • reducing our operating costs , particularly general and administrative expenses . in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section , factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives , which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results , include the following : • imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions , such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees ; • construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores ; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control , such as potential shortages of materials and labor and delays in permits , or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates , either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the u.s . and internationally ; • governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores , including due to public health emergencies ; • not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand , including our emphasis on a broad range of high - quality food offerings ; • not successfully adapting to customer or market factors affecting our supply chain as we work to address sustainability and climate change ; • the deterioration in our credit ratings , which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives ; and • geopolitical instability and international conflicts . effectively managing growth can be challenging , particularly as we continue to expand in international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals , policies and standards . if we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives , or , in the event we undertake large acquisitions , integrations and divestitures , we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets , including goodwill and other intangibles , have become impaired . in the event we record an impairment charge , it could have a material impact on our financial results . • evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business . our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers . our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside - the - home food and beverages ( such as a reduction in discretionary spending as a result of the resumption of student loan payments ) ; lack of customer acceptance of new products ( including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs ) , brands ( such as the global expansion of the starbucks brand ) and platforms ( such as features of our mobile technology , changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives ) ; or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced . in addition , some of our products contain caffeine , dairy products , sugar and other compounds and allergens , the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny , including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects . particularly in the u.s . , there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks , including obesity , as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products . an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products , whether accurate or not , imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components , or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations . our financial results have been , and could continue to be , adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions , including increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets , inflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates , disruptions to our supply chain , changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation , and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . such changes could affect consumer behavior and their ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products . furthermore , our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the persisting impacts of the covid-19 pandemic , including the disruption of customer routines , changes to employer “ work - from - home ” policies and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products . risks related to operating a global business • we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our north america operating segment . our financial performance is highly dependent on our north america operating segment , which comprised approximately [XX] % of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal year [XXXX] . if the north america operating segment revenue trends slow or decline , especially in our u.s . market , our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected . and because the north america segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows , such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders . • we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets . our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets . some or all of our international market business units ( “ mbus ” ) , which we generally define by the countries in which they operate , may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth , which ultimately requires achieving consistent , stable net revenues and earnings . the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate . a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results . the international segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns , along with our north america segment . in particular , our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and international net revenues and operating income . china is expected to be our fastest growing market in terms of percentage growth , our second largest market overall and [XXX] % company - owned . due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth , we are exposed to risks in china , including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following : • the effects of current u.s.-china relations , including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations , potential boycotts and increasing anti - americanism ; • escalating u.s.-china tension and increasing political sensitivities in china ; • the lingering effects of the covid-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in china ; • entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in china ; • changes in economic conditions in china and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class , wages , labor , inflation , discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs ; • ongoing government regulatory reform , including relating to public health , food safety , tariffs and tax , sustainability and responses to climate change , which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs ; • data - privacy and cybersecurity risks unique to the conduct of business in china ; and • food - safety related matters , including compliance with food - safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety . additionally , some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our u.s . stores and licensees . tastes naturally vary by region , and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the u.s . or other international markets . occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the u.s . due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country - specific regulatory requirements . because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development , operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations . • we face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance . we operate in [XX] markets globally . our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad , such as : • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations , or requirements to transact in specific currencies ; • changes or uncertainties in economic , legal , regulatory , social and political conditions in our markets , as well as negative effects on u.s . businesses due to increasing anti - american sentiment in certain markets ; • interpretation and application of laws and regulations , including tax , tariffs , labor , merchandise , anti - bribery and privacy laws and regulations ; • restrictive actions of foreign or u.s . governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment , especially during periods of heightened tension between the u.s . and such foreign governmental authorities , including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs , government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership ; • import or other business licensing requirements ; • the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights ; • limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new u.s . and international regulations ; • in developing economies , the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast ; • difficulty in staffing , developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics , including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service , due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics , distance , language and cultural differences , as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high - quality employees in local markets ; • local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with , retain or terminate employees ; • local regulations , health guidelines and safety protocols affecting our operations ; and • delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control , competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates , any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and , in turn , negatively impact net revenues , operating income and earnings per share . moreover , many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries , which are important to our long - term growth prospects . an inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results . • our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations . the growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into , maintain , develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of , and enforce , commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements . our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market . our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé , which has the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators , with few exceptions . if nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support , protect and grow our brand in channel development , our channel development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time , present long - term challenges to our brand , limit our ability to grow our channel development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results . additionally , the growth of our channel development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses . there are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets . if they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing , or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses , it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets . risks related to supply chain • increases in the cost of high - quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high - quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results . the availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility . we purchase , roast and sell high - quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products . the high - quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “ c ” price . this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly . increases in the “ c ” coffee commodity price increase the price of high - quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed - price purchase commitments . we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality , quantity , delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon , but the date , and therefore price , at which the base “ c ” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established . the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries , such as weather , water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain , natural disasters , crop disease and pests , general increase in farm inputs and costs of production , inventory levels , political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies . climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors . speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices . for example , extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past , and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur in the future , they would have similar consequences on coffee price volatility . because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations , combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities , increases in the cost of high - quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability . in addition , if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage , we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee , which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance . we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products , particularly fluid milk , and to a lesser degree , plant - based dairy - free alternative products , such as oat milk and almond milk , to support the needs of our company - operated retail stores . additionally , other commodities , including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs , such as cocoa , produce , baking ingredients , meats , eggs and energy , as well as the processing of these inputs , are important to our operations . increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities , or lack of availability , whether due to supply shortages , delays or interruptions in processing , or otherwise , especially in international markets , could have a material adverse impact on our profitability . similarly , increases in the cost of , or lack of availability , whether due to supply shortages , delays or interruptions in the processing of plant - based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability . • interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability . any material interruption in our supply chain , such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants , interruptions in service by our third - party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels , trade restrictions , such as increased tariffs or quotas , embargoes or customs restrictions , pandemics , social or labor unrest , labor shortages , natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability . additionally , our food , beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations , and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly . we rely on these suppliers to provide high - quality products and to comply with applicable laws . our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings , especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the u.s . and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure , developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest . for certain products , we may rely on one or very few suppliers . a supplier 's failure to meet our standards , provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control . these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability . risks related to macroeconomic conditions • our financial condition and results of operations are subject to , and may be adversely affected by , a number of macroeconomic and other factors , many of which are also largely outside our control . our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of macroeconomic and other factors , many of which are largely outside our control . any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business , financial condition and/or results of operations : • increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets ; • inflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates ; • disruptions to our supply chain ; • changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation ; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates ; • adverse outcomes of litigation ; • severe weather or other natural or man - made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets ; • changes in climate , including changes to the frequency or severity of extreme weather events , that impact the price and availability or cost of goods and services , energy and other materials throughout our supply chain ; and • especially in our largest markets , including the u.s . and china , labor discord or disruption , geopolitical events , war , terrorism ( including incidents targeting us ) , political instability , acts of public violence , boycotts , increasing anti - american sentiment in certain markets , hostilities and social unrest and health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores . unfavorable economic conditions could also adversely affect our suppliers and licensees , who in turn could experience cash flow problems , more costly or unavailable financing , credit defaults and other financial hardships . this could lead to supplier or licensee insolvency , increase our bad debt expense , or cause us to increase the levels of unsecured credit that we provide to suppliers and licensees . further , if any of our licensees becomes insolvent this could result in our exit from a particular market , and negatively impact our reputation . for example , one of our licensees is experiencing financial solvency issues , which may require the company to expend capital resources to help fund their operating expenses in the short term . • economic conditions in the u.s . and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results . as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending , our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions . a continued economic downturn or recession , or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom , may have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations . our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to starbucks or competitors ’ lower - priced products as a result of various factors , including job losses , inflation , changes in prevailing interest rates , higher taxes , reduced access to credit , changes in federal economic policy , a global health pandemic , international trade disputes or geopolitical instability . we may also experience a reduction and increased volatility in demand for our products in connection with a global health pandemic . for example , in china , reductions and continuing volatility in that market may be caused by , among other things : store closures or modified operating hours and business model , reduced customer traffic due to illness , quarantine or government or self - imposed restrictions placed on our stores ’ operations , impacts caused by precautionary measures such as those related to face coverings and vaccinations and changes in consumer spending behaviors , including those caused by social distancing , a decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending . decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results . there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen , consumers may make long - lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior , including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or enduring changes in behavior that precipitate a more general downturn in the restaurant industry . these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales , profitability or development plans , which could harm our results of operations and financial condition . • failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock . failure to meet market expectations going forward , particularly with respect to our operational and financial results , and expectations regarding the success of our reinvention plan and related guidance , environmental performance and shareholder returns , will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock . in addition , price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance . risks related to human capital • changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business . our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs , including wages and benefits , which , in a retail business such as ours , are two of our most significant costs , both domestically and internationally , including those increases triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages , scheduling and benefits ; increased healthcare and workers ’ compensation insurance costs ; and increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high - quality employees with the right skill sets . the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees , to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high - quality product and customer experience , which could materially harm our business and results of operations . furthermore , we have experienced , and could continue to experience , a shortage of labor for store positions , and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions . in addition , our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent . starting in september [XXXX] , starbucks partners at a number of company - operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the authorities . unions have secured representation rights at a number of these stores , with potentially more to follow . the law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because in certain circumstances the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages , hours or other terms and conditions of employment . these limitations could negatively affect our costs , change our employee culture , and decrease our flexibility . they also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs . moreover , we have experienced job actions in some company - operated stores . such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations , third - party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product , our sales , and our costs . additionally , our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business , including on our financial results . these positions could also expose us to legal risk , causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions , potential penalties and restrictions , and reputational harm . • the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel or effectively managing changes in our workforce could adversely impact our business and financial results . much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel and employees . the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business . our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees upon whom we rely to give customers a superior in - store experience and elevate our brand . accordingly , our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high - quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores , both domestically and internationally . our ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market , which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation , labor shortages , increased employee turnover , changes in availability of our workforce and a shift toward remote or hybrid work arrangements . our ability to attract and retain corporate , retail and other personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high - tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits . additionally , there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives , including increasing our digital relationships with customers . if we are unable to recruit , retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth , our business and financial performance may be adversely affected . risks related to competition • we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets , which could lead to reduced profitability . the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive , including with respect to product quality , innovation , service , convenience , such as delivery service and mobile ordering , and price , and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets . accordingly , we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets . in the u.s . , the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick - service restaurant sector on selling high - quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks ® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations . similarly , continued competition from well - established competitors , or competition from large new entrants or well - funded smaller companies , in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets . many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world , which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets . increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single - serve and ready - to - drink coffee beverage markets , including from new and large entrants to this market , could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment . in addition , not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours , which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors . we may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions , reducing the use of plastic or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability . additionally , if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods , or our competitors respond more effectively , this could have a negative effect on our business . furthermore , declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason , including due to consumer preference for other products , flattening demand for our products , changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores , or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions , could have a negative effect on our business . risks related to environmental , social and governance matters • climate change may have an adverse impact on our business . we recognize that there are inherent climate - related risks wherever business is conducted . for example , as we noted above , the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries , such as weather and water supply quality and availability , which factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change . climate change may also result in decreased availability , less favorable pricing , or other adverse consequences for non - coffee inputs in our products . in particular , climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain , which could have adverse impacts on our business . we operate in [XX] markets globally . our properties and operations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change , which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts . such events have the potential to disrupt our operations , cause store closures , disrupt the business of our third - party suppliers and impact our customers , all of which may cause us to suffer losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations . • our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations , including with respect to environmental , social and governance matters , that could expose us to numerous risks . we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self - regulatory organizations , including the sec , the nasdaq stock market and the financial accounting standards board . these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress , making compliance more difficult and uncertain . in addition , increasingly regulators , customers , investors , employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental , social and governance ( “ esg ” ) matters and related disclosures . these changing rules , regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in , and are likely to continue to result in , increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations . for example , developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of esg , and collecting , measuring and reporting esg - related information and metrics can be costly , difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards , including the sec ’s proposed climate - related reporting requirements , and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies . we may also communicate certain initiatives and goals , regarding environmental matters , diversity , responsible sourcing and social investments and other esg - related matters , in our sec filings or in other public disclosures . these initiatives and goals within the scope of esg could be difficult and expensive to implement , the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace , and we could be criticized for the accuracy , adequacy or completeness of the disclosure . further , statements about our esg - related initiatives and goals , and progress toward those goals , may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing , internal controls and processes that continue to evolve , and assumptions that are subject to change in the future . if we are unable to meet our esg - related goals or evolving stakeholder or industry expectations and standards , or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues , customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor , and our reputation , business or financial condition may be adversely affected . if our esg - related data , processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate , or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of esg on a timely basis , or at all , our reputation , business , financial performance and growth could be adversely affected . in addition , we could be criticized by esg detractors for the scope or nature of our esg initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals . we could also be subjected to negative responses by governmental actors ( such as anti - esg legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment ) or consumers ( such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns ) targeting starbucks that could adversely affect our reputation , business , financial performance and growth . risks related to intellectual property • we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others , which could harm the value of our brand and our business . our brand names , trademarks and related intellectual property rights are critical assets , and our success depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets . we rely on a combination of trademarks , copyrights , service marks , trade secrets , patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products . we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the u.s . and certain foreign jurisdictions . the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the u.s . in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries . it may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property , and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the u.s . and foreign countries may not be adequate . in addition , the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others , and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future . any claim of infringement , whether or not it has merit , could be time - consuming , result in costly litigation and harm our business . in addition , we can not ensure that licensees will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property . risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy • failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences , reputational harm and civil or criminal penalties . complex local , state , national , foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection , use , retention , protection , disclosure , transfer and other processing of personal data . these privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving , with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement . in addition , our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the u.s . are subject to unexpected changes , including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations , to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly . complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services . for example , europe ’s general data protection regulation ( “ gdpr ” ) and the u.k . general data protection regulation ( which implements the gdpr into u.k . law ) , impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance . in china , the personal information protection law ( “ pipl ” ) , has established personal information processing rules , data subject rights , and obligations for personal information processors , among other things . in addition to the pipl , china ’s data security law , regulates data processing activities associated with personal and non - personal data . noncompliance with these laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties . other newly enacted and proposed privacy and data protection laws in other jurisdictions served by starbucks and its licensees may impose similar requirements , including restrictions on cross - border data transfers . such laws may impact starbucks business operations and increase the cost and expense of compliance . in the united states , the california consumer privacy act ( “ ccpa ” ) requires , among other things , covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and allows such consumers new abilities such as the right to opt - out of certain sales of personal information . the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation . further , the california privacy rights act , which became effective in january [XXXX] , significantly modified the ccpa and includes additional compliance obligations . colorado , connecticut and virginia recently enacted similar data privacy legislation that has also gone into effect in [XXXX] , and a new privacy law in utah will go into effect at the end of [XXXX] . in addition , a number of other states have passed or are considering additional privacy laws that are expected to take effect in the near future . these laws will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our efforts to comply . privacy and data protection laws such as those referenced above may impact starbucks operation and new business models , such as starbucks digital solutions , which rely on starbucks functioning as controller of customer personal information in licensed markets . as such , starbucks may be primarily responsible for compliance with privacy and data protection laws in the markets served by participating licensees . our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data , or to protect personal data from unauthorized access , use or other processing , could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us , claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals , fines and damage to our brand reputation , any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations , financial performance and business . the amount and scope of insurance we maintain may not cover all types of claims that may arise . • the unauthorized access , use , theft or destruction of customer or employee personal , financial or other data or of starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues . many of our information technology systems ( whether cloud - based or hosted in proprietary servers ) , including those used for our point - of - sale , web and mobile platforms , online and mobile payment systems , delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions , contain personal , financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers , business partners and employees . many of our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business , such as business plans and product development initiatives and designs , and confidential information about third parties , such as licensees and business partners . similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand , we have in the past experienced , and we expect to continue to experience , cyber - attacks , including phishing , and other attempts to breach , or gain unauthorized access to , our systems and databases . to date , these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations , but we can not provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future . our third - party providers ’ and business partners ’ information technology systems and databases are likewise subject to such risks . the number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to some extent by an increase in our digital operations . in addition , we provide some customer and employee data , as well as starbucks proprietary information and other confidential information important to our business , to third parties to conduct our business , including licensees and business partners . individuals performing work for starbucks and such third parties also may access some of this data , including on personally - owned digital devices . to the extent we , a third party or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or their information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access , theft , use , destruction or other compromises of customers ’ or employees ’ data or confidential information of the company stored in or transmitted through such systems , including through cyber - attacks or other external or internal methods , it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand , a decrease in our ability to retain customers or attract new ones , the imposition of potentially significant costs ( including loss of data or payment for recovery of data ) and liabilities , loss of business , loss of business partners and licensees and the disruption to our supply chain , business and plans . unauthorized access , theft , use , destruction or other compromises are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may occur through a variety of methods , including attacks using malicious code , vulnerabilities in software , hardware or other infrastructure ( including systems used by our supply chain ) , system misconfigurations , phishing or social engineering . the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks . our logging capabilities , or the logging capabilities of third parties , are not always complete or sufficiently granular , affecting our ability to fully understand the scope of security breaches . such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable u.s . and international privacy , cyber and other laws or trigger data breach notification laws , including new disclosure rules promulgated by the sec , and subject us to private consumer , business partner or licensee or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings , any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability . these risks also exist in acquired businesses , joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems . significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to investigate security incidents , remedy cybersecurity problems , recuperate lost data , prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment . these include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies , additional security technologies , trainings , personnel , experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached . these costs , which could be material , could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred , including by interfering with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives , and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems . media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third - party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business . additionally , the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber - attacks and compromise information technology systems , as well as the sources and targets of these attacks , change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time . the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplifies these concerns . we continue to make significant investments in technology , third - party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber - attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss , but these security measures can not provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss . • we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives , and any material failure , inadequacy , interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results . we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions , point - of - sale processing and payment in our stores and online , management of our supply chain , starbucks cards , online business , delivery services , mobile technology , including mobile payments and ordering apps , reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions , including providing starbucks digital solutions to participating licensees , and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality . many of our non - store employees continue to work on a remote or hybrid basis , which has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure . additionally , the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth , including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend , is highly dependent on our technology systems . furthermore , we continue to expand convenience - led formats , which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities . we also rely on third - party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support . additionally , our systems hardware , software and services provided by third - party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets . our contractual and operational safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available . such failures may be caused by various factors , including power outages , climate change - related impacts , catastrophic events , physical theft , computer and network failures , inadequate or ineffective redundancy , problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms , flaws in third - party software or services , errors or improper use by our employees or third - party service providers , or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms , including through cyber - attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third - party business partners ’ or service providers ’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section . if our incident response , disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner , they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales , the efficiency of our operations and our financial results . in addition , remediation of any problems with our systems and related customer support could result in significant , unplanned expenses . risks related to pandemics or epidemics • future health epidemics or pandemics could adversely affect our business and financial results . health epidemics or pandemics have in the past and may in the future impact macroeconomic conditions , consumer behavior , labor availability and supply chain management , as well as local operations in impacted markets , all of which can adversely affect our business , financial results and outlook . governmental responses to health epidemics or pandemics , including operational restrictions , can also affect the foregoing items and adversely affect our business and financial results . the duration and scope of a health epidemic or pandemic can be difficult to predict and depends on many factors , including the emergence of new variants and the availability , acceptance and effectiveness of preventative measures . a health epidemic or pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these risk factors , including , but not limited to , those related to the availability and costs of labor and commodities , supply chain interruptions , consumer behavior , and consumer perceptions of our brand and industry . risks related to governmental and regulatory changes • failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results . our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws , accounting and reporting requirements , tax rules and other regulations and requirements , including those imposed by the sec , nasdaq and foreign countries , as well as applicable trade , labor , healthcare , food and beverage , sanitation , safety , environmental , labeling , anti - bribery and corruption and merchandise laws . such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations , which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non - compliance . changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators may also shift the impact of applicable regulations on the business and the costs necessary to ensure compliance therewith , including through an expansion in the nature , scope or complexity of matters on which we are required to report . changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations , including increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions , to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use , may result in increased compliance costs , capital expenditures , incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners , which could affect our profitability . in addition , our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving u.s . and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection , and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters . the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection , use , dissemination and security of data . the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area . current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations ( including the gdpr and the ccpa , discussed in more detail in this risk factors section , and other applicable international and u.s . privacy laws ) , or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations , may limit our ability to collect and use data , require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines , litigation or orders , which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations . the burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted , or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations , may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business . the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements , our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws . in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand , failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations , as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied , may result in litigation , civil and criminal liability , damages , fines and penalties , increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results ."

company ’s reportable segments consist of the americas , europe , greater china , japan and rest of asia pacific . americas includes both north and south america . europe includes european countries , as well as india , the middle east and africa . greater china includes china mainland , hong kong and taiwan . rest of asia pacific includes australia and those asian countries not included in the company ’s other reportable segments . although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services , each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the company ’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region . markets and distribution the company ’s customers are primarily in the consumer , small and mid - sized business , education , enterprise and government markets . the company sells its products and resells third - party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force . the company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels , such as third - party cellular network carriers , wholesalers , retailers and resellers . during [XXXX] , the company ’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for [XX] % and [XX] % , respectively , of total net sales . competition the markets for the company ’s products and services are highly competitive , and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins , frequent introduction of new products and services , short product life cycles , evolving industry standards , continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics , rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors , and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses . many of the company ’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures , and by imitating the company ’s products and infringing on its intellectual property . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company ’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products , services and technologies to the marketplace . the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products , including the hardware , operating system , numerous software applications and related services . principal competitive factors important to the company include price , product and service features ( including security features ) , relative price and performance , product and service quality and reliability , design innovation , a strong third - party software and accessories ecosystem , marketing and distribution capability , service and support , and corporate reputation . the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones , personal computers , tablets , wearables and accessories , and services . the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical , marketing , distribution and other resources , as well as established hardware , software , and service offerings with large customer bases . in addition , some of the company ’s competitors have broader product lines , lower - priced products and a larger installed base of active devices . competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins . certain competitors have the resources , experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss . the company ’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third - party digital content and applications . the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company ’s product features and applications within their products , or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer . supply of components although most components essential to the company ’s business are generally available from multiple sources , certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources . the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones , personal computers , tablets , wearables and accessories . therefore , many components used by the company , including those that are available from multiple sources , are at times subject to industry - wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations . the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors , and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source . when a component or product uses new technologies , initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers ’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased . the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices , or at all , may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company ’s requirements . the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components ; however , there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms , or at all . research and development because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances , the company ’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products , services and technologies to the marketplace . the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services , and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development ( “ r&d ” ) , licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third - party businesses and technology . intellectual property the company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices , accessories , software and services . this includes patents , designs , copyrights , trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the u.s . and various foreign countries . although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership , the company relies primarily on the innovative skills , technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel . the company regularly files patent , design , copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research , development , design and marketing , and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world . over time , the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world . no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company ’s products and services . the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services . in addition to company - owned intellectual property , many of the company ’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties . it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company ’s products , processes and services . while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past , there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] business seasonality and product introductions the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand . additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses . the timing of product introductions can also impact the company ’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch , and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches . net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction . human capital the company believes it has a talented , motivated and dedicated team , and works to create an inclusive , safe and supportive environment for all of its team members . as of september [XX] , [XXXX] , the company had approximately [XXX,XXX] full - time equivalent employees . workplace practices and policies the company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination . compensation and benefits the company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable , and should enable employees to share in the company ’s success . the company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives . in support of this , the company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees ’ individual growth and development . inclusion and diversity the company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves . the company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level , foster an inclusive culture , and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees . engagement the company believes that open and honest communication among team members , managers and leaders helps create an open , collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute , grow and succeed . team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions , feedback or concerns , and the company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development , manager performance and inclusivity . health and safety the company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates . the company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards . the company supports employees with general safety , security and crisis management training , and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high - hazard environments . additionally , the company works to protect the safety and security of its team members , visitors and customers through its global security team . available information the company ’s annual reports on form [XX] - k , quarterly reports on form [XX] - q , current reports on form [X] - k ,

financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors , whether currently known or unknown , including those described below . when any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time , the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations , financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected . because of the following factors , as well as other factors affecting the company ’s results of operations and financial condition , past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance , and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods . this discussion of risk factors contains forward - looking statements . this section should be read in conjunction with part ii , item [X] , “ management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in part ii , item [X] , “ financial statements and supplementary data ” of this form [XX] - k. macroeconomic and industry risks the company ’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company has international operations with sales outside the u.s . representing a majority of the company ’s total net sales . in addition , the company ’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the company ’s supplier facilities , including manufacturing and assembly sites , are located outside the u.s . as a result , the company ’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions . adverse macroeconomic conditions , including slow growth or recession , high unemployment , inflation , tighter credit , higher interest rates , and currency fluctuations , can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the company ’s products and services . in addition , consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy , financial market volatility , declines in income or asset values , and other economic factors . in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company ’s products and services , uncertainty about , or a decline in , global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the company ’s suppliers , contract manufacturers , logistics providers , distributors , cellular network carriers and other channel partners , and developers . potential outcomes include financial instability ; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations ; and insolvency . adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company ’s trade receivables ; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions ; limitations on the company ’s ability to issue new debt ; reduced liquidity ; and declines in the fair values of the company ’s financial instruments . these and other impacts can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations , financial condition and stock price . the company ’s business can be impacted by political events , trade and other international disputes , war , terrorism , natural disasters , public health issues , industrial accidents and other business interruptions . political events , trade and other international disputes , war , terrorism , natural disasters , public health issues , industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy , and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers , suppliers , contract manufacturers , logistics providers , distributors , cellular network carriers and other channel partners . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company has a large , global business with sales outside the u.s . representing a majority of the company ’s total net sales , and the company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade . substantially all of the company ’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in china mainland , india , japan , south korea , taiwan and vietnam . restrictions on international trade , such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods , technology or data , can materially adversely affect the company ’s operations and supply chain and limit the company ’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers . the impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations . restrictive measures can require the company to take various actions , including changing suppliers , restructuring business relationships , and ceasing to offer third - party applications on its platforms . changing the company ’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive , time - consuming and disruptive to the company ’s operations . such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures . for example , tensions between governments , including the u.s . and china , have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the company ’s business . if disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future , actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the company ’s business . political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending , which could adversely affect the company ’s business . many of the company ’s operations and facilities , as well as critical business operations of the company ’s suppliers and contract manufacturers , are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters . in addition , such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire , power shortages , nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents , terrorist attacks and other hostile acts , ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks , labor disputes , public health issues , including pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic , and other events beyond the company ’s control . global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters , such as droughts , floods , hurricanes and wildfires , occurring more frequently or with more intense effects . such events can make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers , create delays and inefficiencies in the company ’s supply and manufacturing chain , and result in slowdowns and outages to the company ’s service offerings , and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas . following an interruption to its business , the company can require substantial recovery time , experience significant expenditures to resume operations , and lose significant sales . because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components , a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company . the company ’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers . while the company ’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations , an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life , disruption to the company ’s business , and harm to the company ’s reputation . major public health issues , including pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic , have adversely affected , and could in the future materially adversely affect , the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products ; the imposition of protective public safety measures , such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions ; and disruptions in the company ’s operations , supply chain and sales and distribution channels , resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services , and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services . while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses , such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise . global markets for the company ’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change , and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets . the company ’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins , frequent introduction of new products and services , short product life cycles , evolving industry standards , continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics , rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors , and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses . the company ’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products , services and technologies to the marketplace . the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products , including the hardware , operating system , numerous software applications and related services . as a result , the company must make significant investments in r&d . there can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns , and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company currently holds a significant number of patents , trademarks and copyrights and has registered , and applied to register , additional patents , trademarks and copyrights . in contrast , many of the company ’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures , and by imitating the company ’s products and infringing on its intellectual property . effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the company operates . if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company ’s intellectual property , the company ’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected . the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone , personal computer and tablet markets . the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical , marketing , distribution and other resources , as well as established hardware , software and digital content supplier relationships . in addition , some of the company ’s competitors have broader product lines , lower - priced products and a larger installed base of active devices . competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins . certain competitors have the resources , experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss . some of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall . additionally , the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company ’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer . the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the company ’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions . the company ’s services also face substantial competition , including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases . the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free . the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third - party digital content and applications . the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the company ’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages . there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively . business risks to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand , the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services . due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the company competes , the company must continually introduce new products , services and technologies , enhance existing products and services , effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services , and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services . the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors , including timely and successful development , market acceptance , the company ’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp - up issues , the availability of application software for the company ’s products , the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand , the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand , and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies . there can be no assurance the company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services . the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners , many of which are located outside of the u.s . substantially all of the company ’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in china mainland , india , japan , south korea , taiwan and vietnam , and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners , often in single locations . changes or additions to the company ’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties . the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management . while these arrangements can lower operating costs , they also reduce the company ’s direct control over production and distribution . such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided , or adversely affect the company ’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions . although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement , the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out - of - warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time . while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct , violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company relies on single - source outsourcing partners in the u.s . , asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components , and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia , for final assembly of substantially all of the company ’s hardware products . any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the company ’s cost or supply of components or finished goods . in addition , manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons , including natural and man - made disasters , information technology system failures , commercial disputes , armed conflict , economic , business , labor , environmental , public health or political issues , or international trade disputes . the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment , much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners , and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long - term supply agreements . while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods , if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business , such continued supply can be reduced or terminated , and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted . future operating results depend upon the company ’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms . because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources , the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks . many components , including those that are available from multiple sources , are at times subject to industry - wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . for example , the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply , which adversely affected the company ’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all . such disruptions could occur in the future . while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components , there can be no assurance the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms , or at all . component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions , which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry , further limiting the company ’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all . the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company ’s suppliers , described in “ the company ’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition , ” above , can also affect the company ’s ability to obtain components . therefore , the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source . when a component or product uses new technologies , initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers ’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased . the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices , or at all , can be affected for any number of reasons , including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company ’s requirements . when the company ’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained , or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the company , the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source , or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source . the company ’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company ’s business and result in harm to the company ’s reputation . the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects . sophisticated operating system software and applications , such as those offered by the company , often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services . defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties . component defects could make the company ’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury . these risks may increase as the company ’s products are introduced into specialized applications , including health . in addition , the company ’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages , service slowdowns or errors . as a result , from time to time the company ’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations . there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware , software and services it offers . failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company ’s products and services . in addition , the company can be exposed to product liability claims , recalls , product replacements or modifications , write - offs of inventory , property , plant and equipment or intangible assets , and significant warranty and other expenses , including litigation costs and regulatory fines . quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company ’s products and services , and result in harm to the company ’s reputation , loss of competitive advantage , poor market acceptance , reduced demand for products and services , delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company is exposed to the risk of write - downs on the value of its inventory and other assets , in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk . the company records a write - down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand , or for which cost exceeds net realizable value . the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components . the company reviews long - lived assets , including capital assets held at its suppliers ’ facilities and inventory prepayments , for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable . if the company determines that an impairment has occurred , it records a write - down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value . although the company believes its inventory , capital assets , inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable , there can be no assurance the company will not incur write - downs , fees , impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes . the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments . manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company ’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements , typically for periods up to [XXX] days . because the company ’s markets are volatile , competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products , or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments . the company relies on access to third - party intellectual property , which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all . the company ’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties , which requires licenses from those third parties . in addition , because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete , current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents , the company ’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others . from time to time , the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties . based on experience and industry practice , the company believes licenses to such third - party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms . however , there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all . failure to obtain the right to use third - party intellectual property , or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms , can preclude the company from selling certain products or services , or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s future performance depends in part on support from third - party software developers . the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third - party software applications and services . there can be no assurance third - party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company ’s products . if third - party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company ’s products , customers may choose not to buy the company ’s products . the company believes the availability of third - party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers ’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing , maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company ’s products compared to competitors ’ platforms , such as android for smartphones and tablets , windows for personal computers and tablets , and playstation , nintendo and xbox for gaming platforms . this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products , the anticipated revenue that may be generated , expected future growth of product sales , and the costs of developing such applications and services . the company ’s minority market share in the global smartphone , personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company ’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors ’ products with larger market share . when developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms , the availability and quality of applications for the company ’s devices can suffer . the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products . the company ’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change , and when third - party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change , their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences , can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the company ’s products . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [X] the company distributes third - party applications for its products through the app store . for the vast majority of applications , developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the app store . the company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application . from time to time , the company has made changes to its app store , including actions taken in response to competition , market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements . the company expects to make further business changes in the future , including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the app store , such as the european union ( “ eu ” ) digital markets act , which the company is required to comply with by march [XXXX] . the company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the app store , which have resulted in changes to the company ’s business practices , and may in the future result in further changes . changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms . future changes could also affect what the company charges developers for access to its platforms , how it manages distribution of apps outside of the app store , and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms . this could reduce the volume of sales , and the commission that the company earns on those sales , would decrease . if the rate of the commission that the company retains on such sales is reduced , or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated , the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected . failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the company ’s customers , or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms , could have a material adverse impact on the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers . this includes the right to sell , or offer subscriptions to , third - party content , as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the company ’s own services . the licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms , or at all . some third - party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services , and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content . other content owners , providers or distributors may seek to limit the company ’s access to , or increase the cost of , such content . the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules . the company also produces its own digital content , which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent , content and subscribers , and may fail to appeal to the company ’s customers . some third - party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions . if requirements change , the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions . there can be no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner . the company ’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members , the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees , including key personnel , and the company ’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture . much of the company ’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel , including its chief executive officer , executive team and other highly skilled employees . experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense , especially in silicon valley , where most of the company ’s key personnel are located . in addition to intense competition for talent , workforce dynamics are constantly evolving . if the company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively , it could materially adversely affect the company ’s culture , reputation and operational flexibility . the company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success . if the company is unable to nurture its culture , it could materially adversely affect the company ’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success , and could otherwise materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company depends on the performance of carriers , wholesalers , retailers and other resellers . the company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers , wholesalers , retailers and resellers , many of which distribute products and services from competitors . the company also sells its products and services and resells third - party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers , small and mid - sized businesses , and education , enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force . some carriers providing cellular network service for the company ’s products offer financing , installment payment plans or subsidies for users ’ purchases of the device . there can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales , including staffing selected resellers ’ stores with company employees and contractors , and improving product placement displays . these programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales . the financial condition of these resellers could weaken , these resellers could stop distributing the company ’s products , or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company ’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company ’s products . the company ’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions . the company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters , accidents , power disruptions , telecommunications failures , acts of terrorism or war , computer viruses , physical or electronic break - ins , ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents , or other events or disruptions . system upgrades , redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate , and the company ’s or its vendors ’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities . such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company ’s business by , among other things , preventing access to the company ’s online services , interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company ’s products . these events could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information , including personal information , could subject the company to significant reputational , financial , legal and operational consequences . the company ’s business requires it to use and store confidential information , including personal information , with respect to the company ’s customers and employees . the company devotes significant resources to network and data security , including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data . but these measures can not provide absolute security , and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties . the company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations . although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the company ’s behalf , such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to , or releases of , confidential information occur . such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis . these attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality , integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations , and can , among other things , impair the company ’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services , impact the company ’s stock price , materially damage commercial relationships , and expose the company to litigation or government investigations , which could result in penalties , fines or judgments against the company . globally , attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls , avoid detection , and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence , all of which hinders the company ’s ability to identify , investigate and recover from incidents . in addition , attacks against the company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict . although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information , including personal information , affect many companies across various industries , the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates , owns , manages , stores and processes . the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data , and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access , including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies . as with all companies , these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking , ransomware attacks , employee error , malfeasance , system error , faulty password management or other irregularities . for example , third parties can fraudulently induce the company ’s or its vendors ’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames , passwords or other sensitive information , which can , in turn , be used for unauthorized access to the company ’s or its vendors ’ systems and services . to help protect customers and the company , the company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication , monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances , which , among other things , can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company ’s products and services . while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks , such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company ’s ongoing business , present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company has invested , and in the future may invest , in new business strategies or acquisitions . such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties , including distraction of management from current operations , greater - than - expected liabilities and expenses , economic , political , legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses , regions or countries , inadequate return on capital , potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets , and significant write - offs . investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks , including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all , or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the company ’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction . these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful . the failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . the company ’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties . the company ’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition , including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity . other factors include the company ’s ability to : manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation ; manage relationships with existing retail partners ; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory ; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost . legal and regulatory compliance risks the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations . the company is subject to various claims , legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved , and new matters may arise in the future . in addition , agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party . the number of claims , legal proceedings and government investigations involving the company , and the alleged magnitude of such claims , proceedings and government investigations , has generally increased over time and may continue to increase . the company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular - enabled products , and new claims may arise in the future , including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks . for example , technology and other patent - holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights . the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several u.s . jurisdictions , as well as internationally in various countries . the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages . regardless of the merit of particular claims , defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive , time - consuming and disruptive to the company ’s operations . in recognition of these considerations , the company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges . there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur . these agreements can also significantly increase the company ’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the company to change its business practices and limit the company ’s ability to offer certain products and services . except as described in part i , item [X] of this form [XX] - k under the heading “ legal proceedings ” and in part ii , item [X] of this form [XX] - k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note [XX] , “ commitments , contingencies and supply concentrations ” under the heading “ contingencies , ” in the opinion of management , there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss , or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual , concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims . the outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain . if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management ’s expectations , the company ’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected . further , such an outcome can result in significant compensatory , punitive or trebled monetary damages , disgorgement of revenue or profits , remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company , and has from time to time required , and can in the future require , the company to change its business practices and limit the company ’s ability to offer certain products and services , all of which could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims , such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] the company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide , which exposes the company to potential liabilities , increased costs and other adverse effects on the company ’s business . the company ’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects , including antitrust ; privacy , data security and data localization ; consumer protection ; advertising , sales , billing and e - commerce ; financial services and technology ; product liability ; intellectual property ownership and infringement ; digital platforms ; machine learning and artificial intelligence ; internet , telecommunications and mobile communications ; media , television , film and digital content ; availability of third - party software applications and services ; labor and employment ; anticorruption ; import , export and trade ; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions ; anti – money laundering ; foreign ownership and investment ; tax ; and environmental , health and safety , including electronic waste , recycling , product design and climate change . compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive . new and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the company ’s business by increasing the company ’s costs , limiting the company ’s ability to offer a product , service or feature to customers , imposing changes to the design of the company ’s products and services , impacting customer demand for the company ’s products and services , and requiring changes to the company ’s supply chain and its business . new and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied . these risks and costs may increase as the company ’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications , including health and financial services . the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations , but there can be no assurance the company ’s employees , contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company ’s policies and procedures . if the company is found to have violated laws and regulations , it could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the company ’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures . for example , the company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products . although the company has programs , policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements , there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation . as a result , the company ’s products could be banned , delayed or prohibited from importation , which could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . expectations relating to environmental , social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the company to potential liabilities , increased costs , reputational harm , and other adverse effects on the company ’s business . many governments , regulators , investors , employees , customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental , social and governance considerations relating to businesses , including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions , human and civil rights , and diversity , equity and inclusion . in addition , the company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non - financial reports , information provided on its website , press statements and other communications . responding to these environmental , social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties , requires investments , and depends in part on third - party performance or data that is outside the company ’s control . the company can not guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental , social and governance goals and initiatives . in addition , some stakeholders may disagree with the company ’s goals and initiatives . any failure , or perceived failure , by the company to achieve its goals , further its initiatives , adhere to its public statements , comply with federal , state or international environmental , social and governance laws and regulations , or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the company and materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations , financial condition and stock price . the technology industry , including , in some instances , the company , is subject to intense media , political and regulatory scrutiny , which exposes the company to increasing regulation , government investigations , legal actions and penalties . from time to time , the company has made changes to its app store , including actions taken in response to litigation , competition , market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements . the company expects to make further business changes in the future , including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the app store , such as the eu digital markets act , which the company is required to comply with by march [XXXX] , or similar laws in other jurisdictions . changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms . future changes could also affect what the company charges developers for access to its platforms , how it manages distribution of apps outside of the app store , and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the app store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] the company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world , which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could , individually or in the aggregate , have a materially adverse impact on the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . for example , the company is the subject of investigations in europe and other jurisdictions relating to app store terms and conditions . if such investigations result in adverse findings against the company , the company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its app store business , all of which could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . the company is also subject to litigation relating to the app store , which has resulted in changes to the company ’s business practices , and may in the future result in further changes . further , the company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that , if resolved against those other companies , could materially adversely affect the company ’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . for example , the company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the company ’s platforms and applications , and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings . there can be no assurance the company ’s business will not be materially adversely affected , individually or in the aggregate , by the outcomes of such investigations , litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future . changes to the company ’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the company ’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the company ’s products and services , and result in harm to the company ’s reputation , loss of competitive advantage , poor market acceptance , reduced demand for products and services , and lost sales . the company ’s business is subject to a variety of u.s . and international laws , rules , policies and other obligations regarding data protection . the company is subject to an increasing number of federal , state and international laws relating to the collection , use , retention , security and transfer of various types of personal information . in many cases , these laws apply not only to third - party transactions , but also restrict transfers of personal information among the company and its international subsidiaries . several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area , and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending . these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the company to change its business practices . noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability . the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy , information provided on its website , press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers . any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal , state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others . in addition to reputational impacts , penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability . in addition to the risks generally relating to the collection , use , retention , security and transfer of personal information , the company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws , such as health data , financial data and biometric data . health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy , security and breach notification requirements , and the company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company ’s compliance with these obligations . if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements , or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company ’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions , the company can be subject to litigation or government investigations , and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses , and can also incur significant fees or fines . payment card data is also subject to additional requirements . under payment card rules and obligations , if cardholder information is potentially compromised , the company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards . the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards , which could materially adversely affect the company ’s business , reputation , results of operations and financial condition . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] financial risks the company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate . the company ’s profit margins vary across its products , services , geographic segments and distribution channels . for example , the gross margins on the company ’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time . the company ’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors , including : continued industry - wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures ; increased competition ; the company ’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services ; compressed product life cycles ; supply shortages ; potential increases in the cost of components , outside manufacturing services , and developing , acquiring and delivering content for the company ’s services ; the company ’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively ; shifts in the mix of products and services , or in the geographic , currency or channel mix , including to the extent that regulatory changes require the company to modify its product and service offerings ; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates ; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures ; and the introduction of new products or services , including new products or services with higher cost structures . these and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the company ’s results of operations and financial condition . the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand . additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses . further , the company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales . the company could also be subject to unexpected developments , such as lower - than - anticipated demand for the company ’s products or services , issues with new product or service introductions , information technology system failures or network disruptions , or failure of one of the company ’s logistics , components supply , or manufacturing partners . the company ’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s . dollar relative to local currencies . the company ’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non – u.s . dollar – denominated sales , cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide . gross margins on the company ’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations . the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s . dollar adversely affects the u.s . dollar value of the company ’s foreign currency – denominated sales and earnings , and generally leads the company to raise international pricing , potentially reducing demand for the company ’s products . in some circumstances , for competitive or other reasons , the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the u.s . dollar ’s strengthening , which would adversely affect the u.s . dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency – denominated sales . conversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s . dollar , while generally beneficial to the company ’s foreign currency – denominated sales and earnings , could cause the company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments , thereby limiting the benefit . additionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company ’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies , thus adversely affecting gross margins . the company uses derivative instruments , such as foreign currency forward and option contracts , to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates . the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any , or more than a portion , of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place . the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio . the company ’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity , credit deterioration , financial results , market and economic conditions , political risk , sovereign risk , interest rate fluctuations or other factors . as a result , the value and liquidity of the company ’s cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially . therefore , although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities , future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the company ’s results of operations and financial condition . apple inc . | [XXXX] form [XX] - k | [XX] the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable , vendor non - trade receivables and prepayments related to long - term supply agreements , and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen . the company distributes its products and certain of its services through third - party cellular network carriers , wholesalers , retailers and resellers . the company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid - sized businesses and education , enterprise and government customers . a substantial majority of the company ’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral , third - party bank support or financing arrangements , or credit insurance , and a significant portion of the company ’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers . the company ’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited . the company also has unsecured vendor non - trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company . in addition , the company has made prepayments associated with long - term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components . as of september [XX] , [XXXX] , the company ’s vendor non - trade receivables and prepayments related to long - term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia . while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non - trade receivables , as well as long - term prepayments , there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses . the company is subject to changes in tax rates , the adoption of new u.s . or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities . the company is subject to taxes in the u.s . and numerous foreign jurisdictions , including ireland and singapore , where a number of the company ’s subsidiaries are organized . due to economic and political conditions , tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non - income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change . for example , the organisation for economic co - operation and development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules , including the introduction of global minimum tax standards . the company ’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates , changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities , the introduction of new taxes , and changes in tax laws or their interpretation . the application of tax laws may be uncertain , require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations . the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u.s . internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies . the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes . there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations . if the company ’s effective tax rates were to increase , or if the ultimate determination of the company ’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued , the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected . general risks the price of the company ’s stock is subject to volatility . the company ’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future . additionally , the company , the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have , from time to time , experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies ’ operating performance . price volatility may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock ’s price at a given point in time . the company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability . the company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow , and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated . future dividends are subject to declaration by the company ’s board of directors , and the company ’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares . if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth , profitability , dividends , share repurchases or other market expectations , the price of the company ’s stock may decline significantly , which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention ."

productivity . devices face competition from various computer , tablet , and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high - quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points . these manufacturers , many of which are also current or potential partners and customers , include apple and our windows oems . xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services , including those operated by amazon , apple , meta , and tencent . we also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms . our gaming platform competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony , both of which have a large , established base of customers . we believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against , and uniquely differentiated from , competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture , user interface , developer tools , online gaming and entertainment services , and continued strong exclusive content from our own first - party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings . our search and news advertising business competes with google and a wide array of websites , social platforms like meta , and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users . operations we have regional operations service centers that support our operations , including customer contract and order processing , billing , credit and collections , information processing , and vendor management and logistics . the center in ireland supports the african , asia - pacific , european , and middle east regions ; and the centers in arlington , virginia , atlanta , georgia , charlotte , north carolina , fargo , north dakota , fort lauderdale , florida , redmond , washington , reno , nevada , and puerto rico support the american regions . in addition to our operations centers , we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions . we continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers , particularly given the growing demand for ai services . our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land , predictable energy , networking supplies , and servers , including graphics processing units ( “ gpus ” ) and other components . our devices are primarily manufactured by third - party contract manufacturers . for the majority of our products , we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements . however , some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers . extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand . part i item [X] research and development product and service development , and intellectual property we develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups . • cloud and ai – focuses on making it professionals , developers , partners , independent software vendors , and their systems more productive and efficient through development of azure ai platform and cloud infrastructure , server , database , crm , erp , software development tools and services ( including github ) , ai cognitive services , and other business process applications and services for enterprises . • strategic missions and technologies – focuses on incubating technical products and support solutions with transformative potential for the future of cloud computing and continued company growth across quantum computing , azure space & missions engineering , telecommunications , and microsoft federal sales and delivery . • experiences and devices – focuses on delivering high value end - user experiences across our products , services , and devices , including microsoft [XXX] , windows , microsoft teams , search ( including microsoft edge and bing chat ) and other advertising - based services , and the surface line of devices . • microsoft security – focuses on delivering a comprehensive portfolio of services that protect our customers ’ digital infrastructure through cloud platform and application security , data protection and governance , identity and network access , and device management . • technology and research – focuses on fundamental research , product and business incubations , and forward - looking ai innovations that span infrastructure , services , and applications . • linkedin – focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs and the way businesses hire , market , sell , and learn . • gaming – focuses on developing hardware , content , and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction . internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services . it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented . we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design . before releasing new software platforms , and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms , we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development , training , and testing . generally , we also create product documentation internally . we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways . we work actively in the u.s . and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright , trademark , trade secret , and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products , services , business plans , and branding . we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over [XX,XXX] u.s . and international patents issued and over [XX,XXX] pending worldwide . while we employ much of our internally - developed intellectual property in our products and services , we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees ’ products . from time to time , we enter into broader cross - license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents . we may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services . at times , we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective , such as promoting industry standards , advancing interoperability , supporting societal and/or environmental efforts , or attracting and enabling our external development community . our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations . while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services , we believe , based upon past experience and industry practice , such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms . we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products . part i item [X] investing in the future our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products , services , and experiences for our users , to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends , to enter new geographic and product markets , and to drive broad adoption of our products and services . we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company . based on our assessment of key technology trends , we maintain our long - term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies , tools , and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences , cloud computing , ai , devices , and operating systems . while our main product research and development facilities are located in redmond , washington , we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the u.s . and around the world . this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world . we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities , and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the company . in addition to our main research and development operations , we also operate microsoft research . microsoft research is one of the world ’s largest corporate research organizations , often working in close collaboration with top universities around the world , and is focused on advancing the state - of - the - art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines . our investment in fundamental research provides us a unique perspective on future trends and contributes to our innovation . distribution , sales , and marketing we market and distribute our products and services through the following channels : oems , direct , and distributors and resellers . our sales organization performs a variety of functions , including working directly with commercial enterprises and public - sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements ; managing oem relationships ; and supporting system integrators , independent software vendors , and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales , consulting , and fulfillment functions for our products and services . oems we distribute our products and services through oems that pre - install our software on new devices and servers they sell . the largest component of the oem business is the windows operating system pre - installed on devices . oems also sell devices pre - installed with other microsoft products and services , including applications such as office and the capability to subscribe to office [XXX] . there are two broad categories of oems . the largest category of oems are direct oems as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between microsoft and the oem . we have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational oems , including dell , hewlett - packard , lenovo , and with many regional and local oems . the second broad category of oems are system builders consisting of lower - volume pc manufacturers , which source microsoft software for pre - installation and local redistribution primarily through the microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with microsoft . direct many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through enterprise agreements and enterprise services contracts , with sales support from system integrators , independent software vendors , web agencies , and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services ( “ enterprise agreement software advisors ” or “ esa ” ) . microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small , medium , and corporate customers , in addition to those offered through the reseller channel . a large network of partner advisors support many of these sales . we also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers , such as cloud services , search , and gaming , through our digital marketplaces and online stores . additionally , our microsoft experience centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries . part i item [X] distributors and resellers organizations also license our products and services indirectly , primarily through licensing solution partners ( “ lsp ” ) , distributors , value - added resellers ( “ var ” ) , and retailers . although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes , lsps are primarily engaged with large organizations , distributors resell primarily to vars , and vars typically reach small and medium organizations . esas are also typically authorized as lsps and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs . microsoft cloud solution provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services . we distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non - exclusive distributors , authorized replicators , resellers , and retail outlets . individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets . we distribute our devices through third - party retailers . we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support . our dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services . licensing options we offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services , on - premises software , and sa . we license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels . we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes . while these programs may differ in various parts of the world , generally they include those discussed below . sa conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period . it also provides support , tools , training , and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently . sa is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others . volume licensing programs enterprise agreement enterprise agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement . enterprise agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on - premises software organization - wide over a three - year period . organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses . sa is included . microsoft customer agreement a microsoft customer agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented , accepted , and stored through a digital experience . a microsoft customer agreement is a non - expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers over time , whether purchasing through a partner or directly from microsoft . microsoft online subscription agreement a microsoft online subscription agreement is designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to , activate , provision , and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web . the agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud - based services . microsoft products and services agreement microsoft products and services agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on - premises software as needed , with no organization - wide commitment , under a single , non - expiring agreement . organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses . sa is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses . part i item [X] open value open value agreements are a simple , cost - effective way to acquire the latest microsoft technology . these agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on - premises software over a three - year period . under open value agreements , organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and sa is included . select plus a select plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on - premises licenses at any affiliate or department level , while realizing advantages as one organization . organizations purchase perpetual licenses and sa is optional . partner programs the microsoft cloud solution provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value - added services offered by their systems integrator , managed services provider , or cloud reseller partner . partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision , manage , and support their customer subscriptions . the microsoft services provider license agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers . partners license software over a three - year period and are billed monthly based on consumption . the independent software vendor royalty program enables partners to integrate microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users . customers our customers include individual consumers , small and medium organizations , large global enterprises , public - sector institutions , internet service providers , application developers , and oems . our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers ; consequently , backlog is not significant . information about our executiv e officers our executive officers as of july [XX] , [XXXX] were as follows : # # table_start name age position with the company satya nadella chairman and

post on the social media channels listed on our investor relations website . part i item 1a","item 1a . ris k factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties , including those described below , that could adversely affect our business , financial condition , results of operations , cash flows , and the trading price of our common stock . strategic and competitive risks we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services , which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins . competition in the technology sector our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small , specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical , marketing , and financial resources . barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies , shifting user needs , and frequent introductions of new products and services . our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products , devices , and services that appeal to businesses and consumers . competition among platform - based ecosystems an important element of our business model has been to create platform - based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions . a well - established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users , application developers , and the platform provider that can accelerate growth . establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins . we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms . • a competing vertically - integrated model , in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services , has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers , tablets , phones , gaming consoles , wearables , and other endpoint devices . competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform , including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces . they may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer . we also offer some vertically - integrated hardware and software products and services . to the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins . • we derive substantial revenue from licenses of windows operating systems on pcs . we face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers . these devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform . users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers . even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer , the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our pc operating system platforms . competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our pc operating system margins . popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength . in addition , some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer ( “ oem ” ) partners , which may affect their commitment to our platform . • competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases . the variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions . users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms . to compete , we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality , security , customer appeal , and value . efforts to compete with competitors ’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins . competitors ’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives . part i item 1a business model competition companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models . • even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure- , platform- , and software - as - a - service business model , the license - based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue . we bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development , offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products . many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model . • we are investing in artificial intelligence ( “ ai ” ) across the entire company and infusing generative ai capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings . we expect ai technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market . we will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the ai capabilities , products , and services necessary to meet the needs of our customers . to compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change , potential regulatory developments , and public scrutiny . • other competitors develop and offer free applications , online services , and content , and make money by selling third - party advertising . advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost , competing directly with our revenue - generating products . • some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users , using open source ai models , and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services . these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products . some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products . the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes , price reductions , and/or increased operating costs , such as for research and development , marketing , and sales incentives . this may lead to lower revenue , gross margins , and operating income . our increasing focus on cloud - based services presents execution and competitive risks . a growing part of our business involves cloud - based services available across the spectrum of computing devices . our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best - in - class platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains . at the same time , our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud - based services for consumers and business customers . pricing and delivery models are evolving . devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user ’s choice of which cloud - based services to use . certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks . we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud - based strategies . the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment . we embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation . our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the internet of things ( “ iot ” ) , a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors , data , and computing capabilities , including ai . our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure , azure ai , and azure iot edge . we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives . besides software development costs , we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services . these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved . whether we succeed in cloud - based services depends on our execution in several areas , including : • continuing to bring to market compelling cloud - based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share . • maintaining the utility , compatibility , and performance of our cloud - based services on the growing array of computing devices , including pcs , smartphones , tablets , gaming consoles , and other devices , as well as sensors and other iot endpoints . • continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third - party developers . • ensuring our cloud - based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs . • making our suite of cloud - based services platform - agnostic , available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems , including those of our competitors . part i item 1a it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed . if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation , or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services , we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above . this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income . some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud - based services . these include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials , use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles , failure to pay for services accessed , or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks . if our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective , we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage . risks relating to the evolution of our business we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns . we will continue to make significant investments in research , development , and marketing for existing products , services , and technologies , including the windows operating system , microsoft [XXX] , bing , sql server , windows server , azure , office [XXX] , xbox , linkedin , and other products and services . in addition , we are focused on developing new ai platform services and incorporating ai into existing products and services . we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity , communication , and entertainment , including pcs , tablets , gaming devices , and hololens . investments in new technology are speculative . commercial success depends on many factors , including innovativeness , developer support , and effective distribution and marketing . if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value , they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades , unfavorably affecting revenue . we may not achieve significant revenue from new product , service , and distribution channel investments for several years , if at all . new products and services may not be profitable , and even if they are profitable , operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically . we may not get engagement in certain features , like microsoft edge , bing , and bing chat , that drive post - sale monetization opportunities . our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny . perceptions of mismanagement , driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences , could negatively impact product and feature adoption , product design , and product quality . developing new technologies is complex . it can require long development and testing periods . significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue . acquisitions , joint ventures , and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business . we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long - term business strategy . for example , in march [XXXX] we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc . for $ [X.X] billion , and in march [XXXX] we completed our acquisition of nuance communications , inc . for $ [XX.X] billion . in january [XXXX] we announced a definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard , inc . for $ [XX.X] billion . in january [XXXX] we announced the third phase of our openai strategic partnership . acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks , including that they do not advance our business strategy , that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment , that they raise new compliance - related obligations and challenges , that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees , business systems , and technology , that they distract management from our other businesses , or that announced transactions may not be completed . if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party , it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement . the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones , as well as acquired companies ’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance , privacy , and cybersecurity . it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies , or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected . these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements . part i item 1a if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired , we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings . we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions , which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles . we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable . we test goodwill for impairment at least annually . factors that may be a change in circumstances , indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable , include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization , reduced future cash flow estimates , and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate . we have in the past recorded , and may in the future be required to record , a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined , negatively affecting our results of operations . cybersecurity , data privacy , and platform abuse risks cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue , increased costs , liability claims , or harm to our reputation or competitive position . security of our information technology threats to it security can take a variety of forms . individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations , including state - sponsored organizations or nation - states , continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it . these actors may use a wide variety of methods , which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware , software , or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters , using social engineering techniques to induce our employees , users , partners , or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users ’ or customers ’ data , or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks . nation - state and state - sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks . nation - state attacks against us , our customers , or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict , such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine . inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data . for example , system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate . employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users ’ security or systems or reveal confidential information . malicious actors may employ the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware . cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex , increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them . we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods , which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time . cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers . breaches of our facilities , network , or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications , impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data , result in product development delays , compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position , result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets , subject us to ransomware attacks , require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks , or otherwise adversely affect our business . we are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider ’s customers , including us , through software updates . in addition , our internal it environment continues to evolve . often , we are early adopters of new devices and technologies . we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer - oriented technologies . increasing use of generative ai models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries . our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge , or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide . part i item 1a security of our products , services , devices , and customers ’ data the security of our products and services is important in our customers ’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on - premises environments . security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others . threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers . customers using our cloud - based services rely on the security of our infrastructure , including hardware and other elements provided by third parties , to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data . adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems , programs , and services , including many of ours , and we expect that to continue . in addition , adversaries can attack our customers ’ on - premises or cloud environments , sometimes exploiting previously unknown ( “ zero day ” ) vulnerabilities , such as occurred in early calendar year [XXXX] with several of our exchange server on - premises products . vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates , or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers ’ systems . adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation . adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users ’ accounts , including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords . inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access , and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer ’s use of our products or services . we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products . there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks . additionally , we are actively adding new generative ai features to our services . because generative ai is a new field , understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop ; features that rely on generative ai may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries . our customers operate complex it systems with third - party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years . they expect our products and services to support all these systems and products , including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards . as a result , we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product , service , standard , or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available . failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers ’ vulnerability to attack . further , customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology , and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies . in addition , we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services , including security default settings , as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of it operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults . cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised . we are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves . we are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection , tracking , and remediation . we may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack , especially where an attack involves on - premises software such as exchange server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers ’ computing environments . development and deployment of defensive measures to defend against security threats to our internal it systems , our cloud - based services , and our customers ’ systems , we must continuously engineer more secure products and services , enhance security , threat detection , and reliability features , improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others , develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed , maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network , products , and services , and provide security tools such as firewalls , anti - virus software , and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so . customers in certain industries such as financial services , health care , and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services . part i item 1a the cost of measures to protect products and customer - facing services could reduce our operating margins . if we fail to do these things well , actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services , data corruption issues , or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services , or to use competing products or services . customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack , which could delay adoption of additional products or services . customers , and third parties granted access to their systems , may fail to update their systems , continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support , or may fail timely to install or enable security patches , or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices . any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue . actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us . our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability , but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges . at times , to achieve commercial objectives , we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers . our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties . if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components , and if there is a security exploit targeting it , we could face increased costs , liability claims , reduced revenue , or harm to our reputation or competitive position . disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation . as we continue to grow the number , breadth , and scale of our cloud - based offerings , we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users . the continued occurrence of high - profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security . despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies , it is possible our security controls over personal data , our training of employees and third parties on data security , and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage . in addition , third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways . improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation , lead to legal exposure to customers or users , or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data , resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue . our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on - premises or , increasingly , in a cloud - based environment we host . government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders . in the u.s . and elsewhere , we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure . despite our efforts to protect customer and user data , perceptions that the collection , use , and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud - based solutions by consumers , businesses , and government entities . additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns , or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions , may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services . we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures . in certain cases , we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information . changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit , thus diminishing the value of our products and services . abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement . advertising , professional , marketplace , and gaming platform abuses for platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties , including github , linkedin , microsoft advertising , microsoft news , microsoft store , bing , and xbox , our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate . this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of ai technologies , dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users , or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends . preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful , adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements . part i item 1a other digital safety abuses our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law . we may not proactively discover such content due to scale , the limitations of existing technologies , and conflicting legal frameworks . when discovered by users and others , such content may negatively affect our reputation , our brands , and user engagement . regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted , and we expect this to continue . we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight , civil or criminal liability , or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations , adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements . the development of the iot presents security , privacy , and execution risks . to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge , we are developing products , services , and technologies to power the iot . the iot ’s great potential also carries substantial risks . iot products and services may contain defects in design , manufacture , or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes . an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware , sensors , processors , software , and firmware , several of which we may not develop or control . each layer , including the weakest layer , can impact the security of the whole system . many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched . iot solutions may collect large amounts of data , and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements . iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety . if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended , violate the law , or harm individuals or businesses , we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions . these risks , if realized , may increase our costs , damage our reputation or brands , or negatively impact our revenues or margins . issues in the development and use of ai may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability . we are building ai into many of our offerings , including our productivity services , and we are also making ai available for our customers to use in solutions that they build . this ai may be developed by microsoft or others , including our strategic partner , openai . we expect these elements of our business to grow . we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices , applications , and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives . as with many innovations , ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption , and therefore our business . ai algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed . datasets may be overbroad , insufficient , or contain biased information . content generated by ai systems may be offensive , illegal , or otherwise harmful . ineffective or inadequate ai development or deployment practices by microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of ai solutions or cause harm to individuals , customers , or society , or result in our products and services not working as intended . human review of certain outputs may be required . as a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies , our implementation of ai systems could subject us to competitive harm , regulatory action , legal liability , including under new proposed legislation regulating ai in jurisdictions such as the european union ( “ eu ” ) , new applications of existing data protection , privacy , intellectual property , and other laws , and brand or reputational harm . some ai scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society . if we enable or offer ai solutions that have unintended consequences , unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners , or are controversial because of their impact on human rights , privacy , employment , or other social , economic , or political issues , we may experience brand or reputational harm , adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements . part i item 1a operational risks we may have excessive outages , data losses , and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure . our increasing user traffic , growth in services , and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power . we spend substantial amounts to build , purchase , or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters . our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land , predictable energy , networking supplies , and servers , including graphics processing units ( “ gpus ” ) and other components . the cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors , including the transition to a clean energy economy , local and regional environmental regulations , and geopolitical disruptions . these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as bing , azure , microsoft account services , microsoft [XXX] , microsoft teams , dynamics [XXX] , onedrive , sharepoint online , skype , xbox , and outlook.com through the incorporation of ai features and/or functionality . we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back - end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users . maintaining , securing , and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex , and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks . it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve . inefficiencies or operational failures , including temporary or permanent loss of customer data , insufficient internet connectivity , insufficient or unavailable power supply , or inadequate storage and compute capacity , could diminish the quality of our products , services , and user experience resulting in contractual liability , claims by customers and other third parties , regulatory actions , damage to our reputation , and loss of current and potential users , subscribers , and advertisers , each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements . we may experience quality or supply problems . our hardware products such as xbox consoles , surface devices , and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design , manufacture , or associated software . we could incur significant expenses , lost revenue , and reputational harm as a result of recalls , safety alerts , or product liability claims if we fail to prevent , detect , or address such issues through design , testing , or warranty repairs . our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems . the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation . our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads . many of our products and services are interdependent with one another . each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues . any defects we do not detect and fix in pre - release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue , damage to our reputation , repair or remediation costs , delays in the release of new products or versions , or legal liability . although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability , there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge . there are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components . our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us . if components are delayed or become unavailable , whether because of supplier capacity constraint , industry shortages , legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources , or other reasons , we may not obtain timely replacement supplies , resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services . component shortages , excess or obsolete inventory , or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue . xbox consoles , surface devices , datacenter servers , and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain , resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins . legal , regulatory , and litigation risks government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products . government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s . and foreign competition laws . governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations , and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the eu , the u.s . , and china . some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti - competitive conduct . u.s . federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business . part i item 1a for example , the european commission ( “ the commission ” ) closely scrutinizes the design of high - volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products , such as file formats , programming interfaces , and protocols , available to other companies . flagship product releases such as windows can receive significant scrutiny under eu or other competition laws . our portfolio of first - party devices continues to grow ; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms . as a result , increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners , creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules . regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase . certain foreign governments , particularly in china and other countries in asia , have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property . competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses , reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them . new competition law actions could be initiated , potentially using previous actions as precedent . the outcome of such actions , or steps taken to avoid them , could adversely affect us in a variety of ways , including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets , decreasing the value of our assets , adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products , or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value . laws and regulations relating to anti - corruption and trade could result in increased costs , fines , criminal penalties , or reputational damage . the foreign corrupt practices act ( “ fcpa ” ) and other anti - corruption laws and regulations ( “ anti - corruption laws ” ) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees , vendors , or agents , and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls . from time to time , we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s . and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s . and our compliance with anti - corruption laws . periodically , we receive such reports directly and investigate them , and also cooperate with investigations by u.s . and foreign law enforcement authorities . an example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the eu whistleblower directive , initiated in [XXXX] , which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by eu member states . most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves . while we devote substantial resources to our u.s . and international compliance programs and have implemented policies , training , and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity , our employees , vendors , or agents may violate our policies . our failure to comply with anti - corruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties , criminal sanctions against us , our officers , or our employees , prohibitions on the conduct of our business , and damage to our reputation . increasing trade laws , policies , sanctions , and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the u.s . relating to trade and investment . economic sanctions in the u.s . , the eu , and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries . u.s . export controls restrict microsoft from offering many of its products and services to , or making investments in , certain entities in specified countries . u.s . import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries . supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny . periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict , such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine , may result in ( [X] ) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions , which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries , and ( [X] ) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers , partners , and us . non - compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm , operational delays , monetary fines , loss of revenues , increased costs , loss of export privileges , or criminal sanctions . part i item 1a laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs , legal claims , fines against us , or reputational damage . the growth of our internet- and cloud - based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries . legal requirements relating to the collection , storage , handling , and transfer of personal data continue to evolve . for example , while the eu - u.s . data privacy framework ( “ dpf ” ) has been recognized as adequate under eu law to allow transfers of personal data from the eu to certified companies in the u.s . , the dpf is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu to be uncertain . eu data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain u.s.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the u.s . in the eu and other markets , potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services . in addition , the eu general data protection regulation ( “ gdpr ” ) , which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu , imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data . more recently , the eu has been developing new requirements related to the use of data , including in the digital markets act , the digital services act , and the data act , that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services . engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects . we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations , or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive . compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them . if we fail to comply , or if regulators assert we have failed to comply ( including in response to complaints made by customers ) , it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions , which can result in significant monetary penalties , private lawsuits , reputational damage , blockage of international data transfers , and loss of customers . the highest fines assessed under gdpr have recently been increasing , especially against large technology companies . jurisdictions around the world , such as china , india , and states in the u.s . have adopted , or are considering adopting or expanding , laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection , handling , and transfer of personal data . our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services , including ai services , we deliver to customers , to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization , and to customer perceptions of quality . our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment . ongoing legal analyses , reviews , and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices , or relevant practices of other organizations , may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements , including data sovereignty and localization requirements , affecting the location , movement , collection , and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data . compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services , business practices , or internal systems that result in increased costs , lower revenue , reduced efficiency , or greater difficulty in competing with foreign - based firms . compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate . failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity , as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort . existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations . we are subject to a wide range of laws , regulations , and legal requirements in the u.s . and globally , including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings , and those that impose requirements related to user privacy , telecommunications , data storage and protection , advertising , and online content . laws in several jurisdictions , including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code , increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services . this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection , security , law enforcement surveillance , and other obligations . regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection , use , and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations , including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies . new environmental , social , and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure , reporting , and diligence requirements . legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop , implement , or secure our products and services . compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more . legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of ai and content moderation , which could increase costs or restrict opportunity . for example , in the eu , an ai act is being considered , and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our ai services in the european market . part i item 1a how these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear , subject to change over time , and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . in addition , governments ’ approach to enforcement , and our products and services , are continuing to evolve . compliance with existing , expanding , or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations . noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity . in addition , there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups , regulators , competitors , customers , and other stakeholders across many of these areas . if our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements , we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions . we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes . we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits . these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives , including major new product releases such as windows , ai services , significant business transactions , warranty or product claims , employment practices , and regulation . adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business . the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management ’s view of these matters may change in the future . a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable . our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties . we derive substantial revenue from government contracts . government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements . for instance , we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts , we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor , we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties , and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded . some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses . some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval , reductions , cancellations , or delays which could adversely impact public - sector demand for our products and services . these events could negatively impact our results of operations , financial condition , and reputation . we may have additional tax liabilities . we are subject to income taxes in the u.s . and many foreign jurisdictions . significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes . in the course of our business , there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain . for example , compliance with the [XXXX] united states tax cuts and jobs act ( “ tcja ” ) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company , the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements , and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions . as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja or possible future legislative changes , and as we gather more information and perform more analysis , our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements . we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions . although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable , tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken . in addition , economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult . we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years , with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing . the final resolution of those audits , and other audits or litigation , may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made . we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s . a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates , changes in our business or structure , or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company . in addition , changes in u.s . federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals , other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries , including in the u.s . , and changes in taxing jurisdictions ’ administrative interpretations , decisions , policies , and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements . part i item 1a intellectual property risks we face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed . protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult . similarly , the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights . changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents . additionally , licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations . finally , our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations . if we are unable to protect our intellectual property , our revenue may be adversely affected . source code , the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs , is critical to our business . if our source code leaks , we might lose future trade secret protection for that code . it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality , which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results . unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors . third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property . from time to time , others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights . to resolve these claims , we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available , stop selling or redesign affected products or services , or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers . adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing , marketing , and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies . we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk , and may continue to do so . general risks if our reputation or our brands are damaged , our business and operating results may be harmed . our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business . our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer , business , and public - sector customers . there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged . these include product safety or quality issues , our environmental impact and sustainability , supply chain practices , or human rights record . we may experience backlash from customers , government entities , advocacy groups , employees , and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions . damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from , among other things : • the introduction of new features , products , services , or terms of service that customers , users , or partners do not like . • public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy , data practices , or content . • data security breaches , compliance failures , or actions of partners or individual employees . the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood , speed , and magnitude of negative brand events . if our brands or reputation are damaged , it could negatively impact our revenues or margins , or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees . adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business . worsening economic conditions , including inflation , recession , pandemic , or other changes in economic conditions , may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue . if demand for pcs , servers , and other computing devices declines , or consumer or business spending for those products declines , our revenue will be adversely affected . our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network . oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution . the impact of economic conditions on our partners , such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor , oem , or retailer , could cause sales channel disruption . challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased . as a result , allowances for doubtful accounts and write - offs of accounts receivable may increase . part i item 1a we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings , types , and maturities . these investments are subject to general credit , liquidity , market , and interest rate risks , which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets . a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s . government securities . if global financial markets decline for long periods , or if there is a downgrade of the u.s . government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt , our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value , requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements . catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business . a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake , weather event , cyberattack , terrorist attack , pandemic , or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales , providing services , or performing other critical functions . our corporate headquarters , a significant portion of our research and development activities , and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle , washington area , and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california , both of which are seismically active regions . a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems , or the infrastructure or systems they rely on , such as power grids , could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations . providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements . abrupt political change , terrorist activity , and armed conflict , such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine , pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries , which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets . these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers . geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies , access to national , regional , and global markets , hiring , and profitability . geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public - sector customers . any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues . the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic , such as covid-19 , may adversely affect our operations , financial condition , and results of operations . the extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic ; governmental , business , and individuals ' actions in response to the pandemic ; and the impact on economic activity , including the possibility of recession or financial market instability . measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these risk factors . we may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business . if we are unsuccessful , it may adversely impact our revenues , cash flows , market share growth , and reputation . the long - term effects of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear . environmental regulations or changes in the supply , demand , or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services , including natural resources , necessary to run our business . changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud - based services . part i item 1a our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks . our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales . the global nature of our business creates operational , economic , and geopolitical risks . our results of operations may be affected by global , regional , and local economic developments , monetary policy , inflation , and recession , as well as political and military disputes . in addition , our international growth strategy includes certain markets , the developing nature of which presents several risks , including deterioration of social , political , labor , or economic conditions in a country or region , and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations . emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights , the environment , and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments . changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism , protectionism , or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs , local sourcing initiatives , and non - local sourcing restrictions , export controls , investment restrictions , or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries . disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services , impair our ability to operate in certain regions , or increase operating costs . although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure , significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s . dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations . our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees . our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds , experiences , and skill sets . the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive . maintaining our brand and reputation , as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive , are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees . we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws . changes to u.s . immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts . if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts , or if we can not retain highly skilled workers and key leaders , our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected . effective succession planning is also important to our long - term success . failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution . how employment - related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs . our global workforce is predominantly non - unionized , although we do have some employees in the u.s . and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils . in the u.s . , there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union . the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives . part i item 1b , [X] , [X] , [X]"

"" that unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history , inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots . it led us to be a pioneer in the development of ai and , since [XXXX] , an ai - first company . we continue this work under the leadership of alphabet and google ceo , sundar pichai . alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is google . we report google in two segments , google services and google cloud , and all non - google businesses collectively as other bets . alphabet 's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence . access and technology for everyone the internet is one of the world ’s most powerful equalizers ; it propels ideas , people , and businesses large and small . our mission to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in [XXXX] . since then , we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done . we are focused on building an even more helpful google for everyone , and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge , health , happiness , and success . google search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways , with trillions of searches on google every year . youtube provides people with entertainment , information , and opportunities to learn something new . google assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices , providing intelligent help throughout a person 's day , no matter where they are . google cloud helps customers solve today ’s business challenges , improve productivity , reduce costs , and unlock new growth engines . we are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users , partners , customers , and communities and have invested more than $ [XXX] billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts . making ai helpful for everyone ai is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world , and for our business . at google , we have been bringing ai into our products and services for more than a decade and making them available to our users . our journey began in [XXXX] , when machine learning was first incorporated into google search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web . today , ai in our products is [X] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end used by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in google search ; translation across [XXX] languages in google translate ; and organization , searching , and editing in google photos . large language models ( llms ) are an exciting aspect of our work in ai based on deep learning architectures , such as the transformer , a neural network architecture that we introduced in [XXXX] that helped with language understanding . this led to the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers , or bert , in [XXXX] that helped search understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before . google was a company built in the cloud , and we continue to invest in our google cloud offerings , including google cloud platform and google workspace , to help organizations stay at the forefront of ai innovation with our ai - optimized infrastructure , mature ai platform and world - class models , and assistive agents . we believe ai can solve some of the hardest societal , scientific and engineering challenges of our time . for example , in [XXXX] , google deepmind ’s alphafold system solved a [XX] - year - old protein folding challenge . since then , we have open - sourced to the scientific community [XXX] million of alphafold ’s protein structures which are used to work on everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic - eating enzymes . as another example , ai can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful information , predicting climate - related events , and optimizing climate action . using advanced ai and geospatial analysis , google research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real - time flooding information to communities and individuals . as ai continues to improve rapidly , we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we deliver on our mission to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful . with a bold and responsible approach , we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone . deliver the most advanced , safe , and responsible ai we aim to build the most advanced , safe , and responsible ai with models that are developed , trained , and rigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in ai technical infrastructure . in december [XXXX] , we launched gemini , our most capable and general model . it was built from the ground up to be multimodal , which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand , operate across , and combine different types of information , including text , code , audio , images , and video . our teams across alphabet will leverage gemini , as well as other ai models we have previously developed and announced , across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users , advertisers , partners , customers , and developers . we believe our approach to ai must be both bold and responsible . that means developing ai in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges , guided by our ai principles . we published these in [XXXX] , as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use , users , safety , and avoidance of harms above business considerations . while there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible , we believe it is possible — and in fact critical — to embrace that tension productively . enable organizations and developers to innovate on google cloud ai is not only a powerful enabler , it is also a major platform shift . globally , businesses from startups to large enterprises , and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation . that is why we are focused on making it easy and scalable for others to innovate , and grow , with ai . that means providing the most advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to google ’s latest ai models that have been rigorously tested in our own products . our vertex ai platform gives developers the ability to train , tune , augment , and deploy applications using generative ai models and services such as enterprise search and conversations . duet ai for google cloud provides pre - packaged ai agents that assist developers to write , test , document , and operate software . improve knowledge , learning , creativity , and productivity things that we now consider routine – like spell check , mobile check deposit , or google search , google translate , and google maps – all use ai . as ai continues to improve rapidly , we are focused on giving helpful features to our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful . while we have been integrating ai into our products for years , we are now embedding the power of generative ai to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done . for example , duet ai in google workspace helps users write , organize , visualize , accelerate workflows , and have richer meetings . bard allows users to collaborate with experimental ai with new features that include image capabilities , coding support , and app integration . dream screen , a new experimental feature in youtube , allows for the creation of ai - generated video or image backgrounds to shorts by typing an idea into a prompt . [X] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end we also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on google ads to find customers and grow their businesses — and we make that even easier with ai . with performance max , advertisers simply tell us their campaign goals and share their creative assets , and ai will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across all of google ’s properties , to meet their budget . product studio brings the benefits of ai to businesses of all sizes , helping them easily create uniquely - tailored imagery featuring their products — for free . additionally , we are experimenting with search and shopping ads that are directly integrated into the ai - powered snapshot and conversational mode in search generative experience . build the most helpful personal computing platforms and devices over the years , our pixel phones have incorporated ai compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it . our latest pixel devices were built around ai , bringing the best ai - assistive experiences to our users , such as best take , magic editor , and audio magic eraser . as we look ahead , we are designing our android and chrome operating systems with new ai - forward user experiences . moonshots many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done , making only incremental changes . this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time , especially in technology , where change tends to be revolutionary , not evolutionary . people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome , but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer , popular browser . our early investments in ai started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments . we continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term , most notably for the application of ai to our products and services , as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing . as we said in the original founders ' letter , we will not shy away from high - risk , high - reward projects that we believe in , as they are the key to our long - term success . privacy and security we make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products , users , and customers , even if there are near - term financial consequences . we do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default ; strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design ; and building easy - to - use settings that put people in control . we are continually enhancing these efforts over time , whether by enabling users to auto - delete their data , giving them tools , such as my ad center , to control their ad experience , or advancing anti - malware , anti - phishing , and password security features . google for reporting purposes google comprises two segments : google services and google cloud . google services serving our users we have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide . our product innovations are what make our services widely used , and our brand one of the most recognized in the world . google services ' core products and platforms include ads , android , chrome , devices , gmail , google drive , google maps , google photos , google play , search , and youtube , with broad and growing adoption by users around the world . our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than [XX] years ago . while google search started as a way to find web pages , organized into ten blue links , we have driven technical advancements and product innovations that have transformed google search into a dynamic , multimodal experience . we first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search , making it easier to navigate on smaller screens . as new types of content surfaced on the internet , universal search made it possible to search multiple content types , like news , images , videos , and more , to deliver rich , relevant results . the introduction of new search modalities , like voice and visual search , made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways . we took that a step further with multisearch , which lets people search with text and images at the same time . large language models like bert and multitask unified models , or mums , have made it possible to express more natural language queries , vastly improving the quality of results . each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for . this drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like google play and youtube . people are consuming many forms of digital content , including watching videos , streaming tv , playing games , listening to music , [X] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end reading books , and using apps . working with content creators and partners , we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content . fueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices . that is why we continue to invest in platforms like our android mobile operating system , chrome browser , and chrome operating system , as well as growing our family of devices . we see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people 's lives easier by combining the best of our ai , software , and hardware . this potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices , such as the new pixel [X] and pixel [X] pro , and the pixel watch [X] . creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long - term . how we make money we have built world - class advertising technologies for advertisers , agencies , and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses . our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats , and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies . ai has been foundational to our advertising business for more than a decade . products like performance max and product studio use the full power of our ai to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities . google services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on google search & other properties , youtube , and google network partners ' properties ( "" google network properties "" ) . we continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns . • performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers . performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results . our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text - based ads . • brand advertising helps enhance users ' awareness of and affinity for advertisers ' products and services , through videos , text , images , and other interactive ads that run across various devices . we help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand - building marketing campaigns . we have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web . we focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways , including filtering out invalid traffic , removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year , and closely monitoring the sites , apps , and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content . in addition , google services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising , including : • consumer subscriptions , which primarily include revenues from youtube services , such as youtube tv , youtube music and premium , and nfl sunday ticket , as well as google one ; • platforms , which primarily include revenues from google play from the sales of apps and in - app purchases ; and • devices , which primarily include sales of the pixel family of devices . google cloud through our google cloud platform and google workspace offerings , google cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption - based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure , platform , collaboration tools and other cloud services . customers use five key capabilities from google cloud . • ai - optimized infrastructure : provides open , reliable , and scalable compute , networking , and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere — on our cloud , at the edge , or in their data centers . it can be used to migrate and modernize it systems and to train and serve various types of ai models . • cybersecurity : helps customers detect , protect , and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats , with ai integrated to further strengthen security outcomes , prioritize which threats to investigate , and identify attack paths , as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats . • databases and analytics : provides a variety of different types of databases — relational , key - value , in - memory — to store and manage data for different types of applications . our data cloud also unifies data lakes , data warehouses , data governance , and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud . [X] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end • collaboration tools : google workspace and duet ai in google workspace provide easy - to - use , secure communication and collaboration tools , including apps like gmail , docs , drive , calendar , meet , and more . these tools enable secure hybrid and remote work , boosting productivity and collaboration . ai has been used in google workspace for years to improve grammar , efficiency , security , and more with features like smart reply , smart compose , and malware and phishing protection in gmail . duet ai in google workspace helps users write , organize , visualize , accelerate workflows , and have richer meetings . • ai platform and duet ai for google cloud : our vertex ai platform gives developers the ability to train , tune , augment , and deploy applications using generative ai models and services such as enterprise search and conversations . duet ai for google cloud provides pre - packaged ai agents that assist developers to write , test , document , and operate software . other bets across alphabet , we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change . alphabet ’s investment in the portfolio of other bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development , ranging from those in the r&d phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization . our goal is for them to become thriving , successful businesses . other bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors . while these early - stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty , some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries . revenues from other bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare - related services and internet services . competition our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies . we face formidable competition in every aspect of our business , including , among others , from : • general purpose search engines and information services ; • vertical search engines and e - commerce providers for queries related to travel , jobs , and health , which users may navigate directly to rather than go through google ; • online advertising platforms and networks ; • other forms of advertising , such as billboards , magazines , newspapers , radio , and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media , both online and offline ; • digital content and application platform providers ; • providers of enterprise cloud services ; • developers and providers of ai products and services ; • companies that design , manufacture , and market consumer hardware products , including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms ; • providers of digital video services ; • social networks , which users may rely on for product or service referrals , rather than seeking information through traditional search engines ; • providers of workspace communication and connectivity products ; and • digital assistant providers . competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses . for example , for advertising , competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining : • users , for whom other products and services are literally one click away , largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising , as well as the general usefulness , security , and availability of our products and services ; • advertisers , primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads , and ultimately customers , and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels ; and • content providers , primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base , our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising , and the terms of our agreements with them .

zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain , by [XXXX] . to accomplish this , we aim to reduce [XX] % of our combined scope [X] , scope [X] ( market - based ) , and scope [X] absolute emissions ( versus our [XXXX] baseline ) before [XXXX] , and plan to invest in nature - based and technology - based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions . we have formally committed to the science based targets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target . one of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy . since [XXXX] , we have matched [XXX] % of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual basis . however , because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the regions where we operate — and because of the variable supply of these resources — we still need to rely on carbon - emitting energy sources that power local grids . that is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon - free energy ( cfe ) on every grid where we operate by [XXXX] . achieving net - zero emissions and 24/7 cfe by [XXXX] are extremely ambitious goals . we also know that our path to net - zero emissions will not be easy or linear . some of our plans may take years to deliver results , particularly where they involve building new large - scale infrastructure with long lead times . so as our business continues to evolve , we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target . to benefit the people and places where we operate , we have set goals to replenish [XXX] % of the freshwater volume we consume , on average , across our offices and data centers by [XXXX] and to help restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate . we also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations , products , and supply chains . our circularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start , keeping materials in use for as long as possible , and promoting healthy materials — for our data centers , workplaces , and products . more information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports , including google ’s environmental report . the contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form [XX] -

climate change and sustainability ; competition ; consumer protection ; content moderation ; data privacy and security ; news publications ; and reporting on human capital and diversity , we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations , as well as related enforcement actions and investigations , being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world . our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could , individually or in the aggregate , increase our cost of doing business , make our products and services less useful , limit our ability to pursue certain business models , cause us to change our business practices , affect our competitive position relative to our peers , and/or otherwise harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . for additional information about government regulation applicable to our business , see item 1a risk factors ;

party cookies , as well as changes to other companies ’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past , and may in the future , affect the advertising that we are able to provide . in addition , technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult , or that block the display of ads altogether , and some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third - party digital advertising . failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . in addition , expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions . adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected , and may in the future affect , the demand for advertising , resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising , which could harm our financial condition and operating results . we face intense competition . if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users , customers , and other partners , we may not remain competitive , which could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive . our businesses face changing technologies , shifting user needs , and frequent introductions of rival products and services . to compete successfully , we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative , relevant and useful products , services , and technologies in a timely manner . as our businesses evolve , the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services . we must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and r&d , including through acquisitions , in order to enhance our technology , products , and services . we have many competitors in different industries . our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start - ups . some competitors have longer operating histories and well - established relationships in various sectors . they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position , including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic arrangements ; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure , r&d , and in talent ; initiating intellectual property and competition claims ( whether or not meritorious ) ; and continuing to compete for users , advertisers , customers , and content providers . further , discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny , thereby affording them competitive advantages . our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do . we are expanding our investment in ai across the entire company . this includes generative ai and continuing to integrate ai capabilities into our products and services . ai technology and services are highly competitive , rapidly evolving , and require significant investment , including development and operational costs , to meet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users . our ability to deploy certain ai technologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third - party equipment and technical infrastructure . additionally , other companies may develop ai products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost - effective to deploy . other companies may also have ( or in the future may obtain ) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent , limit , or interfere with our ability to make , use , or sell our own ai products and services . our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the evolving needs and desires of our users , advertisers , publishers , customers , and content providers . as new and existing technologies continue to develop , competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are , or [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end that are seen to be , substantially similar to or better than ours . these technologies could reduce usage of our products and services , and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services . competitors ’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users , advertisers , publishers , customers , and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results . our ongoing investment in new businesses , products , services , and technologies is inherently risky , and could divert management attention and harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses , products , services , and technologies in a wide range of industries beyond online advertising . the investments that we are making across our businesses , such as building ai capabilities into new and existing products and services , reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are helpful to users , advertisers , publishers , customers , and content providers . our investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and , in pursuing new strategies , we may incur unanticipated liabilities . innovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends . these endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties , including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations , different monetization models , and the use of alternative investment , governance , or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives . within google services , we continue to invest heavily in devices , including our smartphones , home devices , and wearables , which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services , rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors , increased market saturation in developed countries , short product life cycles , evolving industry standards , continual improvement in performance characteristics , and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses . there can be no assurance we will be able to provide devices that compete effectively . within google cloud , we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise - ready cloud services , including google cloud platform and google workspace , and we are advancing our ai platforms and models to support these tools and technologies . we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services , invest in cybersecurity , and hire talent , particularly to support and scale our sales force . at the same time , our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud - based services . pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving , and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives . further , our business with public sector customers may present additional risks , including regulatory compliance risks . for instance , we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews , and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal , financial , and/or reputational risks . evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments , build new products , and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries , and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements . within other bets , we are investing significantly in the areas of health , life sciences , and transportation , among others . these investment areas face intense competition from large , experienced , and well - funded competitors , and our offerings , many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies , may not be successful , or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability . in addition , new and evolving products and services , including those that use ai , raise ethical , technological , legal , regulatory , and other challenges , which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services . because all of these investment areas are inherently risky , no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation , financial condition , and operating results . our revenue growth rate could decline over time , and we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin in the future . our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors , including changes in the devices and modalities used to access our products and services ; changes in geographic mix ; deceleration or declines in advertiser spending ; competition ; customer usage and demand for our products ; decreases in our pricing of our products and services ; ongoing product and policy changes ; and shifts to lower priced products and services . in addition , we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors , such as an increase in the mix of lower - margin products and services , in particular from the continued expansion of our business into new fields , including products and services such as our devices , google cloud , and consumer subscription products , as well as significant investments in other bets , all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising . in particular , margins on our devices have had , and may continue to have , an adverse effect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales . we may also experience [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations , increasing competition , and increasing costs for many aspects of our business . further , certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue . we may also not be able to execute our efforts to re - engineer our cost base successfully or in a timely manner . due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business , our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance . for additional information , see trends in our business and financial effect and revenues and monetization metrics in part ii , item [X] of this annual report on form [XX] - k. our intellectual property rights are valuable , and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products , services , and brands as well as affect our ability to compete . our patents , trademarks , trade secrets , copyrights , and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us . various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights , as well as to our products , services , and technologies . for example , effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet . also , the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective . although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations , it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations . moreover , we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important . there is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable . we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets . the secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised , which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets . we also face risks associated with our trademarks . for example , there is a risk that the word “ google ” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “ search . ” some courts have ruled that "" google "" is a protectable trademark , but it is possible that other courts , particularly those outside of the u.s . , may reach a different determination . if this happens , we could lose protection for this trademark , which could result in other people using the word “ google ” to refer to their own products , thus diminishing our brand . any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete . also , protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming . any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results . our business depends on strong brands , and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users , advertisers , customers , content providers , and other partners . our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business . maintaining and enhancing the brands within google services , google cloud , and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users , advertisers , customers , content providers , and other partners . our brands have been , and may in the future be , negatively affected by a number of factors , including , among others , reputational issues , third - party content shared on our platforms , data privacy and security issues and developments , and product or technical performance failures . for example , if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers , or otherwise to adequately address user concerns , our users may lose confidence in our brands . furthermore , failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high - quality , trustworthy , innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings . we face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management , which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our services . we rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure , and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to assemble the devices and equipment . we also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and distribution of our products and services . our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms , or if those we engage fail to meet their [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end obligations ( whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons ) , or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them . we have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages , price increases , quality issues , and/or longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations , driven by raw material , component availability , manufacturing capacity , labor shortages , industry allocations , logistics capacity , inflation , foreign currency exchange rates , tariffs , sanctions and export controls , trade disputes and barriers , forced labor concerns , sustainability sourcing requirements , geopolitical tensions , armed conflicts , natural disasters or pandemics , the effects of climate change ( such as sea level rise , drought , flooding , heat waves , wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire prevention , and increased storm severity ) , power loss , and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers . some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources , and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption . a significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability . we may enter into long - term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions . we may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand , technological change , changed consumer preferences , quality , product recalls , and warranty issues . for instance , because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume - based pricing or minimum purchase requirements , if the volume of sales of our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets , we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating results . furthermore , certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply . our devices have had , and in the future may have , quality issues resulting from design , manufacturing , or operations . sometimes , these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers . if the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective or require a recall , it could harm our reputation , financial condition , and operating results . we require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and , where applicable , our company policies and practices , such as the google supplier code of conduct , regarding workplace and employment practices , data security , environmental compliance , and intellectual property licensing , but we do not control them or their practices . violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions , canceled orders , harm to key relationships , and damage to our reputation . their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims . interruption to , interference with , or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services , which could harm our reputation , financial condition , and operating results . the availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems . our systems are vulnerable to damage , interference , or interruption from modifications or upgrades , terrorist attacks , state - sponsored attacks , natural disasters or pandemics , geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts , export controls and sanctions , the effects of climate change ( such as sea level rise , drought , flooding , heat waves , wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire prevention , and increased storm severity ) , power loss , utility outages , telecommunications failures , computer viruses , software bugs , ransomware attacks , supply - chain attacks , computer denial of service attacks , phishing schemes , or other attempts to harm or access our systems . some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters . our data centers are also subject to break - ins , sabotage , and intentional acts of vandalism , and , in some cases , to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area . some of our systems are not fully redundant , and disaster recovery planning can not account for all eventualities . the occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic , closure of a facility , or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service . in addition , our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past , and may contain in the future , errors or vulnerabilities , which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems . any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing services , which could harm our reputation , financial condition , and operating results . our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income , and we plan to continue to grow internationally . international revenues accounted for approximately [XX] % of our consolidated revenues in [XXXX] . in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section , our international operations expose us to other risks , including the following : • restrictions on foreign ownership and investments , and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s . ; • sanctions , import and export controls , other market access barriers , political unrest , geopolitical tensions , changes in regimes , or armed conflict ( such as ongoing conflicts in the middle east and ukraine ) , any of which may affect our business continuity , increase our operating costs , limit demand for our products and services , limit our ability to source components or final products , or prevent or impede us from operating in certain jurisdictions , complying with local laws , or offering products or services ; • longer payment cycles in some countries , increased credit risk , and higher levels of payment fraud ; • an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation , new regulatory costs and challenges ( including new customer requirements ) , uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes , and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent ; • anti - corruption laws , such as the u.s . foreign corrupt practices act , and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials , violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties ; and • different employee / employer relationships , existence of works councils and differing labor practices , and other challenges caused by distance , language , local expertise , and cultural differences , increasing the complexity of doing business in multiple jurisdictions . because we conduct business in currencies other than u.s . dollars but report our financial results in u.s . dollars , we have faced , and will continue to face , exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure , significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s . dollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings . hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results . we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and , in some instances , our financial statements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies . the fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be , and certain investments have been in the past , negatively affected by liquidity , credit deterioration or losses , performance and financial results of the underlying entities , foreign exchange rates , changes in interest rates , including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates , the effect of new or changing regulations , the stock market in general , or other factors . we measure certain of our non - marketable equity and debt securities , certain other instruments including stock - based compensation awards settled in the stock of other bet companies , and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination , at fair value on a nonrecurring basis , which is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation . all gains and losses on non - marketable equity securities are recognized in oi&e , which increases the volatility of our oi&e . the unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value remeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments . as a result of these factors , the value of our investments could decline , which could harm our financial condition and operating results . risks related to our industry people access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences . if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces , our business could be harmed . people access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers , mobile phones , smartphones , laptops and tablets , video game consoles , voice - activated speakers , wearables ( including virtual reality and augmented reality devices ) , automobiles , and television - streaming devices . our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces . each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices , and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result . some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices . in addition , search queries may be undertaken via voice - activated search , apps , [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end social media or other platforms , which could harm our business . it is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services . we expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices . failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers , suppliers , distributors , developers , and users , or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms , could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities . issues in the development and use of ai may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure . our evolving ai - related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content , inaccuracies , discrimination , intellectual property infringement or misappropriation , defamation , data privacy , cybersecurity , and other issues . as a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies , our implementation of ai systems could subject us to competitive harm , regulatory action , legal liability ( including under new and proposed legislation and regulations ) , new applications of existing data protection , privacy , intellectual property , and other laws , and brand or reputational harm . some uses of ai will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society . in order to implement ai responsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects , we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant resources to develop , test , and maintain our products and services , but we may not be able to identify or resolve all ai - related issues , deficiencies , and/or failures before they arise . unintended consequences , uses , or customization of our ai tools and systems may negatively affect human rights , privacy , employment , or other social concerns , which may result in claims , lawsuits , brand or reputational harm , and increased regulatory scrutiny , any of which could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation , cause us to incur significant liability , and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services . computer viruses , software bugs or defects , security breaches , and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users ’ and customers ’ ability to use our products and services , harming our business and reputation . concerns about , including the adequacy of , our practices with regard to the collection , use , governance , disclosure , or security of personal data or other data - privacy - related matters , even if unfounded , could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change . our products and services involve the storage , handling , and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information . software bugs , theft , misuse , defects , vulnerabilities in our products and services , and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information , which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities , including regulatory fines and penalties , as well as reputational harm . additionally , our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies , and thus our technologies and software have contained , and are likely in the future to contain , undetected errors , bugs , and/or vulnerabilities . we continue to add new features involving ai to our offerings and internal systems , and features that rely on ai may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our and the market ’s understanding of ai - centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop . we have in the past discovered , and may in the future discover , some errors in our software code only after we have released the code . systems and control failures , security breaches , failure to comply with our privacy policies , and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure , seriously harm our reputation , brand , and business , and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers . such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services . while there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage , we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs , theft , misuse , and security vulnerabilities or breaches . we experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis . cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume , and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time . we have seen , and will continue to see , industry - wide software supply chain vulnerabilities , which could affect our or other parties ’ systems . we expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future . our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack . in addition , we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation - states and state - sponsored actors . these attacks may target us or our customers , particularly our public sector customers ( including federal , state , and local governments ) . geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts , such as the ongoing conflict in the middle east and ukraine , may increase these risks . we may experience security issues , whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance , system errors , or vulnerabilities in our or other parties ’ systems . while we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end time they occur and may remedy them quickly , there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal , financial , and reputational harm , including government inquiries , enforcement actions , litigation , and negative publicity . there is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate , even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence . because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to , disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target , even taking all reasonable precautions , including those required by law , we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures . further , if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data - security practices , fail to comply with our terms and policies , or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach , our users ’ data may be improperly accessed , used , or disclosed . if an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners ’ or service providers ’ security occurs , the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed , we could lose users and customers , our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised , and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks , including legal claims ( which may include class - action litigation ) and regulatory actions , fines , and penalties . any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . while we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities , including dedicated worldwide incident response teams , our response process , particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic , may not be adequate , may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident , may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm , or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident . as a result , we may suffer significant legal , reputational , or financial exposure , which could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . for additional information , see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘ risks related to laws , regulations , and policies ’ below . our ongoing investments in safety , security , and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data . in addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks , we are making significant investments in safety , security , and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties , including investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services . as a result of these efforts , we have in the past discovered , and may in the future discover , incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties . however , we may not have discovered , and may in the future not discover , all such incidents or activity , whether as a result of our data limitations , including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services , the scale of activity on our platform , or other factors , including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic , and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties . such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms , contracts or policies , the existence of false or undesirable user accounts , election interference , improper ad purchases , activities that threaten people ’s safety on- or off - line , or instances of spamming , scraping , or spreading disinformation . while we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly , there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal , financial , and reputational harm , including government inquiries and enforcement actions , litigation , and negative publicity . there is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate , even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence . we may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents . any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement , harm our reputation and brands , require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations , and adversely affect our business and financial results . any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries , which could result in monetary penalties and damages , divert management ’s time and attention , and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight . problematic content on our platforms , including low - quality user - generated content , web spam , content farms , and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services , which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services . we , like others in the industry , face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms , including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues , or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent . while we invest significantly in efforts to promote high - quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low - quality content and invalid traffic , we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end uniformly high - quality content . increased use of ai in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of abuse for bad actors . many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines , including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine 's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them . such efforts have affected , and may continue to affect , the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false , misleading , or undesirable content . although english - language web spam in our search results has been reduced , and web spam in most other languages is limited , we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings . although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms , there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful , and our users may have negative experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended , which may affect our users ' decisions in continuing to use our platforms . we also face other challenges from low - quality and irrelevant content websites , including content farms , which are websites that generate large quantities of low - quality content to help them improve their search rankings . we are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from low - quality websites , but we may not always be successful . we also face other challenges on our platforms , including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference , activities that threaten the safety and/or well - being of our users on- or off - line , and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation . if we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high - quality content , it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms , harming our financial condition and operating results . it may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions , which could result in monetary penalties and damages and divert management ’s time and attention . our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users . internet access providers may be able to restrict , block , degrade , or charge for access to certain of our products and services , which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers . our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet , and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively . currently , this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace , including incumbent telephone companies , cable companies , mobile communications companies , and government - owned service providers . some of these providers have taken , or have stated that they may take , measures that could degrade , disrupt , or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings , by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings , or by providing our competitors preferential access . some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers ; however , substantial uncertainty exists in the u.s . and elsewhere regarding such protections . for example , in [XXXX] the u.s . federal communications commission repealed net neutrality rules , which could permit internet access providers to restrict , block , degrade , or charge for access to certain of our products and services . in addition , in some jurisdictions , our products and services have been subject to government - initiated restrictions or blockages . these could harm existing key relationships , including with our users , customers , advertisers , and/or content providers , and impair our ability to attract new ones ; harm our reputation ; and increase costs , thereby negatively affecting our business . risks related to laws , regulations , and policies we are subject to a variety of new , existing , and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business , and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business . we are subject to numerous u.s . and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects , and our introduction of new businesses , products , services , and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations . in recent years , governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy , particularly in the areas of data privacy and security , competition , environmental , social and governance ( esg ) requirements , ai , and online content . the costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future . new or changing laws and regulations , or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices , have resulted in , and may continue to result in , less useful products and services , altered business practices , limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services , substantial costs , and civil or criminal liability . examples include laws and regulations regarding : • competition and technology platforms ’ business practices : laws and regulations focused on large technology platforms , including the digital markets act in the european union ( eu ) ; regulations and legal [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end settlements in the u.s . , south korea , and elsewhere that affect google play ’s billing policies , fees , and business model ; as well as litigation and new regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions . • ai : laws and regulations focused on the development , use , and provision of ai technologies and other digital products and services , which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions . for example , while legislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved , provisional political agreement on a proposed eu ai act was reached between co - legislators in december [XXXX] , including that specific transparency and other requirements would be introduced for general purpose ai systems and the models on which those systems are based . in addition , the white house 's executive order on the safe , secure , and trustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence devises a framework for the u.s . government , among other things , to regulate private sector use and development of certain foundation models . • data privacy , collection , and processing : laws and regulations further restricting the collection , processing , and/or sharing of user or advertising - related data , including privacy and data protection laws ; laws affecting the processing of children 's data ( as discussed further below ) , data breach notification laws , and laws limiting data transfers ( including data localization laws ) . • copyright and other intellectual property : copyright and related laws , including the eu directive on copyright in the digital single market and european economic area transpositions , which may introduce new licensing regimes , increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms , or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers , which may result in other regulatory actions . • content moderation : various laws covering content moderation and removal , and related disclosure obligations , such as the eu 's digital services act , florida ’s senate bill [XXXX] and texas ’ house bill [XX] , and laws and proposed legislation in singapore , australia , and the united kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms , which may make it harder for services like google search and youtube to detect and deal with low - quality , deceptive , or harmful content . • consumer protection : consumer protection laws , including the eu ’s new deal for consumers , which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations . in addition , the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations , as interpreted by courts , regulators , or administrative bodies , remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business . for example , we rely on statutory safe harbors , like those set forth in the digital millennium copyright act and section [XXX] of the communications decency act in the u.s . and the e - commerce directive in europe , to protect against liability for various linking , caching , ranking , recommending , and hosting activities . legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges . there are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the u.s . , eu , and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms . our development , use , and commercialization of ai products and services ( including our implementation of ai in our offerings and internal systems ) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability , including under specific legislation regulating ai , as well as new applications of existing data protection , cybersecurity , privacy , intellectual property , and other laws . we are and may continue to be subject to claims , lawsuits , regulatory and government investigations , enforcement actions , consent orders , and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . we are subject to claims , lawsuits , regulatory and government investigations , other proceedings , and orders involving competition , intellectual property , data privacy and security , tax and related compliance , labor and employment , commercial disputes , content generated by our users , goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms , personal injury , and other matters . we are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty , product liability , and consumer protection claims related to product defects , among other litigation , and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety , hazardous materials usage , other environmental effects , ai training , development , and commercialization , or service disruptions or failures . claims have been brought , and we expect will continue to be brought , against us for defamation , negligence , breaches of contract , copyright and trademark infringement , unfair competition , unlawful activity , torts , privacy rights violations , fraud , or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services , the design and effect of our products and services , or due to our involvement in hosting , transmitting , marketing , branding , or providing access to content created by third parties . [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end for example , in december [XXXX] , a california jury delivered a verdict in epic games v. google finding that google violated antitrust laws related to google play 's billing practices . the presiding judge will determine remedies in [XXXX] and the range of potential remedies vary widely . we plan to appeal . in addition , the u.s . department of justice , various u.s . states , and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business , including our advertising technologies and practices , the operation and distribution of google search , and the operation and distribution of the android operating system and play store . other regulatory agencies in the u.s . and around the world , including competition enforcers , consumer protection agencies , and data protection authorities , have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations . we are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate . various laws , regulations , investigations , enforcement lawsuits , and regulatory actions have involved in the past , and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties , injunctive relief , ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations , changes to our products and services , alterations to our business models and operations , including divestiture , and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences , all of which could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . any of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs , diversion of management resources , negative publicity and other harms to our business . estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex , fact - specific , and speculative process that requires significant judgment , and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our estimates . the resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in , and may in the future result in , additional substantial fines , penalties , injunctions , and other sanctions that could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . for additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject , see legal proceedings in part i , item [X] of this annual report on form [XX] - k. privacy , data protection , and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas . any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection , data usage , and encryption of user data . adverse legal rulings , legislation , or regulation have resulted in , and may continue to result in , fines and orders requiring that we change our practices , which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services , harming our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation , and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business . examples of these laws include : • the general data protection regulation and the united kingdom general data protection regulations , which apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or the united kingdom , respectively , or related to products and services that we offer to eu or the united kingdom users or customers , respectively , or the monitoring of their behavior in the eu or the uk , respectively . • various comprehensive u.s . state and foreign privacy laws , which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents ( including , in california , a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices ) and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data . • state laws governing the processing of biometric information , such as the illinois biometric information privacy act and the texas capture or use of biometric identifier act , which impose obligations on businesses that collect or disclose consumer biometric information . • various federal , state , and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to children and minors , including the collection and processing of children and minor ’s data . these include the children ’s online privacy protection act of [XXXX] , and the united kingdom age - appropriate design code , all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children . • the california internet of things security law , which regulates the security of data used in connection with internet - connected devices . • the eu ’s digital markets act , which will require in - scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies , among other changes . [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end further , we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether , how , and under what circumstances we can transfer , process and/or receive personal data , as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory authorities related to cross - border transfers of personal data . the validity of various data transfer mechanisms we currently rely upon remains subject to legal , regulatory , and political developments in both europe and the u.s . , which may require us to adapt our existing arrangements . we face , and may continue to face , intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend , result in significant damage awards or other costs ( including indemnification awards ) , and limit our ability to use certain technologies . we , like other internet , technology , and media companies , are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights , including patent , copyright , trade secrets , and trademarks . parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in u.s . and international courts and the u.s . international trade commission ( itc ) for exclusion and cease - and - desist orders . in addition , patent - holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us . as we continue to expand our business , the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products , services , and technologies . adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages , costly royalty or licensing agreements ( if licenses are available at all ) , or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the u.s . or elsewhere , including by preventing us from offering certain features , functionalities , products , or services in certain jurisdictions . they may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business . many of our agreements with our customers and partners , including certain suppliers , require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them , which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims . such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products , services , and technologies , as a result of injunctions or otherwise , which could result in loss of revenues and harm our business . moreover , intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers , when obtainable , may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims . furthermore , in connection with our divestitures , we have agreed , and may in the future agree , to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities , including those associated with intellectual property claims . regardless of their merits , intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle . to the extent such claims are successful , they could harm our business , including our product and service offerings , financial condition , and operating results . expectations relating to esg considerations could expose us to potential liabilities , increased costs , and reputational harm . we are subject to laws , regulations , and other measures that govern a wide range of topics , including those related to matters beyond our core products and services . for instance , new laws , regulations , policies , and international accords relating to esg matters , including sustainability , climate change , human capital , and diversity , are being developed and formalized in europe , the u.s . , and elsewhere , which may entail specific , target - driven frameworks and/or disclosure requirements . we have implemented robust esg programs , adopted reporting frameworks and principles , and announced a number of goals and initiatives . the implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments , and our goals , with all of their contingencies , dependencies , and in certain cases , reliance on third - party verification and/or performance , are complex and ambitious , and may change . we can not guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all , and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate . any failure , or perceived failure , by us to adhere to our public statements , comply fully with developing interpretations of esg laws and regulations , or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business , reputation , financial condition , and operating results . we could be subject to changes in tax rates , the adoption of new u.s . or international tax legislation , or exposure to additional tax liabilities . we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the u.s . and numerous foreign jurisdictions . our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors , including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates , net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program , changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation , changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities , and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws , regulations , or accounting principles ( including changes in the interpretation of existing laws ) . further , if we are [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers , employees and partners as the withholding agent , we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties . we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities . as a result , we have received , and may in the future receive , assessments in multiple jurisdictions , on various tax - related assertions , such as transfer - pricing adjustments or permanent - establishment claims . any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial condition and operating results , require adverse changes to our business practices , or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries . in addition , the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty . although we believe our estimates are reasonable , the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made . furthermore , due to shifting economic and political conditions , tax policies , laws , or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results . for example , various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue - based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted taxes , which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes . the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) is coordinating negotiations among more than [XXX] countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies , including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of [XX] % . o ur effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years as a result of these changes . risks related to ownership of our stock we can not guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long - term stockholder value , and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves . we engage in share repurchases of our class a and class c stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the board of directors of alphabet . our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares . further , our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices , increase their volatility , reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time , which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock . the concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ’ ability to influence corporate matters . our class b stock has [XX] votes per share , our class a stock has one vote per share , and our class c stock has no voting rights . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , larry page and sergey brin beneficially owned approximately [XX.X] % of our outstanding class b stock , which represented approximately [XX.X] % of the voting power of our outstanding common stock . through their stock ownership , larry and sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval , including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions , such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets , for the foreseeable future . in addition , because our class c stock carries no voting rights ( except as required by applicable law ) , the issuance of the class c stock , including in future stock - based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs , could continue larry and sergey ’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders . the share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect larry and sergey ’s relative voting power . this concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders ’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial , which could reduce the market price of our class a stock and our class c stock . provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable . provisions in alphabet ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management . these provisions include the following : • our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation , death , or removal of a director . • our stockholders may not act by written consent , which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders ' meeting . • our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors . this limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates . [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end • stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders ’ meeting . these provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer 's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company . • our board of directors may issue , without stockholder approval , shares of undesignated preferred stock , which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us . as a delaware corporation , we are also subject to certain delaware anti - takeover provisions . under delaware law , a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of [XX] % or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or , among other things , the board of directors has approved the transaction . our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us . the trading price for our class a stock and non - voting class c stock may continue to be volatile . the trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile . in addition to the factors discussed in this report , the trading prices of our class a stock and class c stock have fluctuated , and may continue to fluctuate widely , in response to various factors , many of which are beyond our control , including , among others , the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world . these broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our class a stock and our class c stock , regardless of our actual operating performance . general risks our operating results may fluctuate , which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations . our operating results have fluctuated , and may in the future fluctuate , as a result of a number of factors , many outside of our control , including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events . as a result , comparing our operating results ( including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues ) on a period - to - period basis may not be meaningful , and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance . consequently , our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations . acquisitions , joint ventures , investments , and divestitures could result in operating difficulties , dilution , and other consequences that could harm our business , financial condition , and operating results . acquisitions , joint ventures , investments , and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital , and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results . we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements , which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures . some of the areas where we face risks include : • diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic arrangements ; • failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis , if at all , from governmental authorities , or conditions placed upon approval that could , among other things , delay or prevent us from completing a transaction , or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction ; • failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations , technologies , services , and personnel ( including cultural integration and retention of employees ) and further develop the acquired business or technology ; • implementation of controls ( or remediation of control deficiencies ) , procedures , and policies at the acquired company ; • integration of the acquired company ’s accounting and other administrative systems , and the coordination of product , engineering , and sales and marketing functions ; • transition of operations , users , and customers onto our existing platforms ; • in the case of foreign acquisitions , the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic , currency , political , and regulatory risks associated with specific countries ; • failure to accomplish commercial , strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments , joint ventures , and other strategic arrangements ; • failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity ; [XX] . # # table_start alphabet inc . # # table_end • liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition , including patent and trademark infringement claims , data privacy and security issues , violations of laws , commercial disputes , tax liabilities , warranty claims , product liabilities , and other known and unknown liabilities ; and • litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company , including claims from terminated employees , customers , former stockholders , or other third parties . our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits , incur unanticipated liabilities , and harm our business generally . our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities , the incurrence of debt , contingent liabilities , or amortization expenses , or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long - lived assets , and restructuring charges , any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results . also , the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize . in connection with our divestitures , we have agreed , and may in the future agree , to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities , which could harm our financial condition and operating results . we rely on highly skilled personnel and , if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel , hire qualified personnel , or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture , we may not be able to grow or operate effectively . our performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as well as members of our senior management team . for instance , sundar pichai is critical to the overall management of alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology , maintaining our culture , and setting our strategic direction . our ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify , hire , develop , motivate , and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization . competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense , and certain of our competitors have directly targeted , and may continue to target , our employees . in addition , our compensation arrangements , such as our equity award programs , may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees . restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire , mobilize , or retain some of our global talent . all of our executive officers and key employees are at - will employees , and we do not maintain any key - person life insurance policies . in addition , we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation , creativity , and teamwork . as our organization grows and evolves , we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever - changing circumstances , such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic , and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture . under our hybrid work models , we may experience increased costs and/or disruption , in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture ."

jurisdictions . our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products . we also rely on international treaties , organizations , and foreign laws to protect our ip . the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold , including various countries in asia , may not protect our products or ip rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states . this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely . we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as : • the location in which our products are manufactured ; • our strategic technology or product directions in different countries ; • the degree to which ip laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions ; and • the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors ' operations in particular countries and regions . we have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements . government regulations our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws , rules , and regulations of the united states as well as of foreign governments . during the third quarter of fiscal year [XXXX] , the u.s . government , or the usg , announced licensing requirements that , with certain exceptions , impact exports to china ( including hong kong and macau ) and russia of our a100 and h100 integrated circuits , dgx or any other systems or boards which incorporate a100 or h100 integrated circuits . in july [XXXX] , the usg informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of a100 and h100 products destined to certain customers and other regions , including some countries in the middle east . in october [XXXX] , the usg announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year [XXXX] for exports to china and country groups d1 , d4 , and d5 ( including but not limited to saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , and vietnam , but excluding israel ) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds , including a100 , a800 , h100 , h800 , l4 , l40 , l40s and rtx [XXXX] . the licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in , or with an ultimate parent headquartered in , country group d5 , including china . on october [XX] , [XXXX] , the usg informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our a100 , a800 , h100 , h800 , and l40s products . our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term , if there are further changes in the usg ’s export controls . given the increasing strategic importance of ai and rising geopolitical tensions , the usg has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements , negatively impacting our business and financial results . in the event of such change , we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements , effectively excluding us from all or part of the china market , as well as other impacted markets , including the middle east . while we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain , which is currently concentrated in the asia - pacific region , new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business . refer to “ item 1a . risk factors – risks related to regulatory , legal , our stock and other matters ” for a discussion

industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results . our accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology , customer requirements , competitive products , and industry standards . our success depends on our ability to : • timely identify industry changes , adapt our strategies , and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets , including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies ; • develop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development ; • launch new offerings with new business models including software , services , and cloud solutions , as well as software- , infrastructure- , or platform - as - a - service solutions ; • expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies ; • meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety , security , reliability expectations , and compliance standards ; • manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end - user satisfaction ; • develop , acquire , maintain , and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business , including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products , acquisition integrations , customer support , e - commerce , ip licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity ; and • complete technical , financial , operational , compliance , sales and marketing investments for the above activities . we have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history , which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years , if at all . if we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies , or if they do not become widely adopted , our financial results could be adversely affected . obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will demand . they also do not guarantee revenue . failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations . we can not ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners . if we fail any of these key success criteria , our financial results may be harmed . we have begun offering enterprise customers nvidia dgx cloud services directly and through our network of partners , which include cloud - based infrastructure , software and services for training and deploying ai models , and nvidia ai foundations for customizable pretrained ai models . we have partnered with csps to host such software and services in their data centers , and we entered and may continue to enter into multi - year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities . the timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change , impacting our revenue , expenses , and development timelines . nvidia dgx cloud services may not be successful and will take time , resources , and investment . we also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions , including nvidia ai enterprise , nvidia omniverse , nvidia drive , and several other software solutions . these new business models or strategies may not be successful , and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services . we may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings . competition could adversely impact our market share and financial results . our target markets remain competitive , and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings , industry standards , customer needs , new entrants and consolidations . our competitors ’ products , services and technologies , including those mentioned above in this annual report on form [XX] - k , may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours , which has resulted and may in the future result in lower - than - expected selling prices for our products . some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities , and have longer operating histories , larger customer bases , more comprehensive ip portfolios and patent protections , more design wins , and greater financial , sales , marketing and distribution resources than we do . these competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so , more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end - user trends , more quickly transition their products , and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply - constrained environment , which could harm our business . some of our customers have in - house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing . for example , others may offer cloud - based services that compete with our ai cloud service offerings , and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives . if we are unable to successfully compete in this environment , demand for our products , services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue . risks related to demand , supply and manufacturing failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand . we use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products , and we have long manufacturing lead times . we are not provided guaranteed wafer , component and capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non - linear within a quarter or year . if our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate , as we have experienced in the past , there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand . this mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory , has varied across our market platforms , and has significantly harmed our financial results . we build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand . while we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long - term supply and capacity commitments , we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs , or our long - term demand expectations may change . these risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles , enter new lines of business , or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain , creating additional supply chain complexity . additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties . this risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . in periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain , the lead times on our orders may be extended . we have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than [XX] months . we have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so . if our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs , we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits . we may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines . many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers ’ future demand for our products , or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue , including : • changes in product development cycles and time to market ; • competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements ; • changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand ; • sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues ; • rapidly changing technology or customer requirements ; • the availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure ; • new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products ; • new or unexpected end - use cases ; • increase in demand for competitive products , including competitive actions ; • business decisions made by third parties ; • the demand for accelerated or ai - related cloud services , including our own software and nvidia dgx cloud services ; • changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies ; • the demand for our products ; or • government actions or changes in governmental policies , such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage . demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year [XXXX] . entering fiscal year [XXXX] , we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions . we have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year [XXXX] . we have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers , added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements . these increased purchase volumes , the number of suppliers , and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk . we may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements . our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year [XXXX] were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components . supply of hopper architecture products is improving , and demand remains very strong . we expect our next - generation products to be supply - constrained based upon demand indications . we may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines . our customer orders and longer - term demand estimates may change or may not be correct , as we have experienced in the past . product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products . due to our product introduction cycles , we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our data center , professional visualization , and gaming products . we will have a broader and faster data center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of ai opportunities . the increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times . qualification time for new products , customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue . we have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions , and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions . if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason , our financial results may be negatively impacted . the increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions , warranty or other costs or result in product delays . deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies , which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand . while we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time , these transitions are difficult , may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix , and we may incur additional costs . many end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple oems , odms , system integrators , distributors , and other channel partners . as a result , the decisions made by our multiple oems , odms , system integrators , distributors , and other channel partners , and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end - user demand for our products , have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand , particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties . if we underestimate our customers ' future demand for our products , our foundry partners may not have adequate lead - time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis . even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand , we may not be able to do so in a timely manner , or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints . if we can not procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers ’ orders on a timely basis , or at all , our customer relationships could be damaged , we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed . additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout , supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact . if we overestimate our customers ’ future demand for our products , or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors , we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments . in the past , we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices , including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement , as a result of our overestimation of future demand , and we may need to continue these reductions . we have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers ’ increase in prices , and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future . we have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties , and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future . these impacts were amplified by our placement of non - cancellable and non - returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products . the risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply . all of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results . we build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications , such as nvidia dgx cloud services , nvidia ai foundations , omniverse platform , llms , and generative ai models . our demand estimates for new use cases , applications , and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels , and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases , applications , and services . recent technologies , such as generative ai models , have emerged , and while they have driven increased demand for data center , the long - term trajectory is unknown . because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications , it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative ai models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand . additionally , we started shipping our cpu product offerings , the grace cpu and grace hopper superchips , in the third quarter of fiscal year [XXXX] . our ability to adequately predict our cpu demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels . challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis . extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters , pandemics or other events . in addition , geopolitical tensions , such as those involving taiwan and china , which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers , contract manufacturers , and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us . the use of our gpus other than that for which they were designed and marketed , including new and unexpected use cases , has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products , including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand . for example , several years ago , our gaming gpus began to be used for mining digital currencies , such as ethereum . it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining , or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining , on demand for our products . volatility in the cryptocurrency market , including new compute technologies , price changes in cryptocurrencies , government cryptocurrency policies and regulations , new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions , has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products . changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including , but not limited to , the ethereum [X.X] merge in [XXXX] , have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining . this has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our gpus , which could negatively impact retail prices for our gpus and reduce demand for our new gpus . in general , our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “ gray market , ” which also makes demand forecasting difficult . gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels . additionally , we depend on developers , customers and other third parties to build , enhance , and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms . we also rely on third - party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms , such as geforce now . failure by developers , customers , and other third parties to build , enhance , and maintain applications that leverage our platforms , or failure by third - party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms , could adversely affect customer demand . dependency on third - party suppliers and their technology to manufacture , assemble , test , or package our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality , manufacturing yields , and product delivery schedules and could harm our business . we depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques . we do not assemble , test , or package our products , but instead contract with independent subcontractors . these subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems , boards , and products . we face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain , negatively impact longer - term demand for our products and services , and adversely affect our business operations , gross margin , revenue and/or financial results , including : • lack of guaranteed supply of wafer , component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices , from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner ; • failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products ; • failure by our foundries to develop , obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies , including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products ; • failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements ; • limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers , foundries , contract manufacturers , assembly and test providers and memory manufacturers ; • loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss , addition or change of a supplier ; • lack of direct control over product quantity , quality and delivery schedules ; • suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification ; • delays in product shipments , shortages , a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors ’ or other customers ’ orders over ours ; • requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance ; • low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry ’s proprietary process technology ; and • disruptions in manufacturing , assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves , earthquakes , fires , or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts . defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate , which can damage our reputation and cause us to lose market share . our hardware and software product and service offerings are complex . they have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design , fabrication , packaging , materials , bugs and/or use within a system . these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices , markets , technologies and applications or as new versions are released . these risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products , as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production . ai software products we or our partners offer rely on training data that may originate from third parties and new training methods , and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and errors , or reflect unintended bias . although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement , we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time . some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used . undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property , or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services . defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by oems , odms , aibs and automotive manufacturers and tier [X] automotive suppliers , and to the user of such end product . any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty , support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise , write - off the value of related inventory , and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue . our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers . an error or defect in new products , releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance , loss of design wins , temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers ’ perceptions of our brand , which would in turn negatively impact our business operations , gross margin , revenue and/or financial results . we may be required to reimburse our customers , partners or consumers , including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations , or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies . for example , in fiscal year [XXXX] , a defect was identified in a third - party component embedded in certain data center products . this defect has had , and other defects may in the future have , an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods . these costs could be significant in future periods . we recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year [XXXX] primarily in connection with this defect . while we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligations , we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect . in general , if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us , even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party , such as within our supply chain , the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business . further , our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms , which could adversely impact our financial results . risks related to our global operating business adverse economic conditions may harm our business . economic and industry uncertainty or changes , including recession or slowing growth , inflation , changes or uncertainty in fiscal , monetary or trade policy , disruptions to capital markets and the banking system , currency fluctuations , higher interest rates , tighter credit , lower capital expenditures by businesses , including on it infrastructure , increases in unemployment , labor shortages , and lower consumer confidence and spending , global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse , wide - ranging effects on our business and financial results , including : • increased costs for wafers , components , logistics , and other supply chain expenses , which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future ; • increased supply , employee , facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets , which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins ; • decrease in demand for our products , services and technologies and those of our customers , partners or licensees ; • the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers ’ or our licensees ’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users ; • limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions ; • the insolvency of key suppliers , distributors , customers , cloud service providers , data center providers , licensing parties or other third parties we rely on ; • reduced profitability of customers , which may cause them to scale back operations , exit businesses , file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations , or lead to mergers , consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies , which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively ; and • increased credit and collectability risks , higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets , reduced liquidity , adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers , failures of counterparties , including financial institutions and insurers , asset impairments , and declines in the value of our financial instruments . adverse developments affecting financial institutions , such as bank failures or instability , or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks , could lead to market - wide liquidity problems and other disruptions , which could impact our customers ’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us , our vendors ’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us , or our ability to fulfill our own obligations . additionally , we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings , types , and maturities . these investments are subject to general credit , liquidity , market and interest rate risks , which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets , as described above . a majority of our investment portfolio comprises usg securities . a decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the usg credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates , a decline in the value of the u.s . dollar , reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions . these factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges . international sales and operations are a significant part of our business , which exposes us to risks that could harm our business . we sell our products internationally , and we also have operations and conduct business internationally . our semiconductor wafers are manufactured , assembled , tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states , and we generated [XX] % of our revenue in fiscal year [XXXX] from sales outside of the united states . our sales to china decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from [XX] % in fiscal year [XXXX] to [XX] % in fiscal year [XXXX] . although we have not received licenses from the usg to ship restricted products to china , we have started to ship alternatives to the china market in small volumes . china represented a mid - single digit percentage of our data center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year [XXXX] due to usg licensing requirements and we expect china to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year [XXXX] . the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties , which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and results of operations . these include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business , government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues , differing legal standards with respect to protection of ip and employment practices , different domestic and international business and cultural practices , disruptions to capital markets , counter - inflation policies , currency fluctuations , natural disasters , acts of war or other military actions , terrorism , public health issues and other catastrophic events . product , system security , and data protection breaches , as well as cyber - attacks , could disrupt our operations , reduce our expected revenue , increase our expenses , and significantly harm our business and reputation . security breaches , computer malware , social - engineering attacks , denial - of - service attacks , software bugs , server malfunctions , software or hardware failures , loss of data or other information technology assets , and other cyber - attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated , making it more difficult to successfully detect , defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures . cyber - attacks , including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors , nation - states , and nation - state - supported actors , may become more prevalent and severe . our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack , or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible . individuals , groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations , including nation - states and nation - state - supported actors , and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber - attacks . additionally , some actors are using ai technology to launch more automated , targeted and coordinated attacks . due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts , we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber - attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products . we may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees , contractors or other third - party service providers . certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees , contractors and/or other third - party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control mechanisms . we have in the past experienced , and may in the future experience , security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms and , although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business , there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us . furthermore , we rely on products and services provided by third - party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems , including without limitation , cloud - based infrastructure , encryption and authentication technology , employee email and other functions , which exposes us to supply - chain attacks or other business disruptions . we can not guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners ’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities , defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems , including our products and services , or the third - party information technology systems that support our services . we may also incorporate third - party data into our ai algorithms or use open - source datasets to train our algorithms . these datasets may be flawed , insufficient , or contain certain biased information , and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents . we may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third - party suppliers , including for our ai algorithms . our ability to monitor these third parties ’ information security practices is limited , and they may not have adequate information security measures in place . in addition , if one of our third - party suppliers suffers a security incident ( which has happened in the past and may happen in the future ) , our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems , logs and other information related to the security incident . additionally , we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and , as a result , if our products or services are compromised , a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected , which could result in potential liability and harm our business . to defend against security incidents , we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features , which is expected to result in increased expenses . we must also continue to develop our security measures , including training programs and security awareness initiatives , designed to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place , and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers , applicable industry standards , and government regulations . while we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified , we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls , systems or software , including third - party software we have installed , as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred . further , we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities . these vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm , and if exploited , these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident . we hold confidential , sensitive , personal and proprietary information , including information from partners and customers . breaches of our security measures , along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties , could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss , or misuse of this information , potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability , regulatory inquiries or actions , damage to our brand and reputation or other harm , including financial , to our business . for example , we hold proprietary game source code from third - party partners in our gfn service . breaches of our gfn security measures , which have happened in the past , could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code , damage both us and our partners , and expose nvidia to potential litigation and liability . if we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident , which has occurred in the past , or are perceived to have experienced a security incident , we may experience adverse consequences , including government enforcement actions , additional reporting requirements and/or oversight , restrictions on processing data , litigation , indemnification obligations , reputational harm , diversion of funds , diversion of management attention , financial loss , loss of data , material disruptions in our systems and operations , supply chain , and ability to produce , sell and distribute our goods and services , and other similar harms . inability to fulfill orders , delayed sales , lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results , stock price and reputation . applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders , including affected individuals , customers , regulators and investors , of security incidents , and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity . in addition to experiencing a security incident , third parties may gather , collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources , data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our business . business disruptions could harm our operations , lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs . our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions , power or water shortages , telecommunications failures , supplier disruptions , terrorist attacks , acts of violence , political and/or civil unrest , acts of war or other military actions , epidemics or pandemics , abrupt regulatory deterioration , and other natural or man - made disasters and catastrophic events . our corporate headquarters , a large portion of our current data center capacity , and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california , and other critical business operations , finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in asia , making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes , wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas . catastrophic events can also have an impact on third - party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel . our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities . geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control , can increase economic volatility globally . political instability , changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business , financial condition and results of operations . worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts , including but not limited to china , hong kong , israel , korea and taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements , and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies , product demand , access to global markets , hiring , and profitability . for example , other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the state of israel , where we have engineering , sales support operations and manufacturing , and companies with israeli operations , including by economic boycotts . our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing , logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason , including natural disasters , high heat events or water shortages , power shortages , information technology system failures or cyber - attacks , military actions or economic , business , labor , environmental , public health , or political issues . the ultimate impact on us , our third - party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown . in the event a disaster , war or catastrophic event affects us , the third - party systems on which we rely , or our customers , our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue , increases in expenses , and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations . all of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results . we are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around israel on our operations , including the health and safety of our approximately [X,XXX] employees in the region who primarily support the research and development , operations , and sales and marketing of our networking products . our operating expenses in fiscal year [XXXX] include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity . we believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact . further , in connection with the conflict , a substantial number of our employees in the region have been called - up for active military duty in israel . accordingly , some of our employees in israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent , which may cause disruption to our product development or operations . we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our business ; however , if the conflict is further extended , it could impact future product development , operations , and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business . additionally , interruptions or delays in services from csps , data center co - location partners , and other third parties on which we rely , including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties , could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business . as we increase our reliance on these third - party systems and services , our exposure to damage from service interruptions , defects , disruptions , outages , shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase . data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy . power or water shortages , or regulations that limit energy or water availability , could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services . climate change may have a long - term impact on our business . climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers , partners and vendors . water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical , and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events . extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in northern california may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk , which can have adverse implications for our santa clara , california headquarter offices and data centers , including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively . climate change , its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we , our customers , partners and our vendors do business , may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition , losses and costs to maintain or resume operations . although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property , casualty , and other risks , the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost . some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions , and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim . losses not covered by insurance may be large , which could harm our results of operations and financial condition . our business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate - related laws , regulations and lawsuits . new or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes , fuel or energy taxes , pollution limits , sustainability - related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs , including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes , increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment , and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions , other compliance costs , as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us . these costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities . stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change , and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm . we may not achieve our stated sustainability - related goals , which could harm our reputation , or we may incur additional , unexpected costs to achieve such goals . we may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change - related disruptions , which could result in increased litigation and costs . we also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns . our business could be negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our gpus , despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms . we may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions , and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies , which could hurt our ability to grow our business , develop new products or sell our products . we have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products , services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives . acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business , develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results . if we pursue a particular transaction , we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives . if we are unable to timely complete acquisitions , including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals , we may be unable to pursue other transactions , we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company , technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive , and other changes can take place , which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business . regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions . in addition , to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed , future acquisitions may be more difficult , complex or expensive . further , our investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment . in addition , we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives . these companies can include early - stage companies still defining their strategic direction . many of the instruments in which we invest are non - marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment , and we are not always able to achieve a return . to the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful , we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment . our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks , and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses . we face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments , including the diversion of capital and other resources , including management ’s attention ; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment , if at all ; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental , regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing ; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment ; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring . additional risks related to acquisitions include , but are not limited to : • difficulty in integrating the technology , systems , products , policies , processes , or operations and integrating and retaining the employees , including key personnel , of the acquired business ; • assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses , impairment charges to goodwill or write - downs of acquired assets ; • integrating accounting , forecasting and controls , procedures and reporting cycles ; • coordinating and integrating operations , particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate ; • stock price impact , fines , fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition ; • potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions , resulting in increased debt , increased interest expense , and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions ; • the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities ; • the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance - based consideration ; • negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate ; • exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities ; and • impairment of relationships with , or loss of our or our target ’s employees , vendors and customers . for example , when integrating acquisition target systems into our own , we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration , delays in purchasing and shipping products , difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers , and training and change management needs of integration personnel . these challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future . we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us , and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers . we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network . sales to one customer , customer a , represented [XX] % of total revenue for fiscal year [XXXX] , which was attributable to the compute & networking segment . with several of these channel partners , we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels . our operating results depend on sales within our partner network , as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors . in the future , these partners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem , or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way . because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis , our customers can generally cancel , change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty . our partners or customers may develop their own solutions ; our customers may purchase products from our competitors ; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products , all of which may alter partners ’ or customers ’ purchasing patterns . many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple oems , odms , system integrators , distributors and other channel partners . one indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors , including through customer a , is estimated to have represented approximately [XX] % of total revenue for fiscal year [XXXX] , attributable to the compute & networking segment . if end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end , the system integrators , distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit , which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue . the loss of any of our large customers , a significant reduction in purchases by them , our inability to sell to a customer due to u.s . or other countries ’ trade restrictions or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations . if we are unable to attract , retain and motivate our executives and key employees , our business may be harmed . to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully , we must attract , retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop capable and diverse talent . labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control , including our industry ’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders , cost inflation and workforce participation rates . changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees . competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock - based compensation , and in times of stock price volatility , as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future , the retentive value of our stock - based compensation may decrease . additionally , we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team . failure to ensure effective succession planning , transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long - term success . our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business , and internal controls . we rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions , including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by section [XXX] of the sarbanes - oxley act . the efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth . we continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning , or erp , system . any erp system implementation may introduce problems , such as quality issues or programming errors , that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results . these changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time . failure to implement new or updated controls , or difficulties encountered in their implementation , could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations . identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls , even if quickly remediated once disclosed , may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline . remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses , and if we fail to remediate any material weakness , our financial statements may be inaccurate , we may be required to restate our financial statements , our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected , our access to the capital markets may be restricted , our stock price may decline , and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities . our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate , and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors , our stock price could decline . our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk factors . therefore , investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance . additional factors that could affect our results of operations include , but are not limited to : • our ability to adjust spending due to the multi - year development cycle for some of our products and services ; • our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers ; • our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers , the inability of some customers to make required payments , our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms , and customer bad debt write - offs ; • our vendors ' payment requirements ; • unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities ; and • changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards . any of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results . for example , we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers , particularly during macroeconomic downturns , which could impact our ability to collect payment . our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms , which may impact our cash flow generation . these arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations . in addition , the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth , creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable . failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline , as it has in the past , or experience substantial price volatility . risks related to regulatory , legal , our stock and other matters our operations could be affected by the complex laws , rules and regulations to which our business is subject , and political and other actions may adversely impact our business . we are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide , affecting our operations in areas including , but not limited to , ip ownership and infringement ; taxes ; import and export requirements and tariffs ; anti - corruption , including the foreign corrupt practices act ; business acquisitions ; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions ; data privacy requirements ; competition and antitrust ; advertising ; employment ; product regulations ; cybersecurity ; environmental , health , and safety requirements ; the responsible use of ai ; sustainability ; cryptocurrency ; and consumer laws . compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive , could impact our competitive position , and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products . there can be no assurance that our employees , contractors , suppliers , customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies , controls , and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws , and violations could result in fines , criminal sanctions against us , our officers , or our employees , prohibitions on the conduct of our business , and damage to our reputation . changes to the laws , rules and regulations to which we are subject , or changes to their interpretation and enforcement , could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business . for example , we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation , regulation , administrative rule making , increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks . our position in markets relating to ai has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide , including the european union , the united states , the united kingdom and china . for example , the french competition authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets . we have also received requests for information from regulators in the european union , the united kingdom , and china regarding our sales of gpus , our efforts to allocate supply , foundation models and our investments , partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models , and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future . governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware , software , and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative ai . if implemented , such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers , delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products , and reduce the number of new entrants and customers , negatively impacting our business and financial results . revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation , trade sanctions , the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs , restrictions and controls on imports or exports , or other retaliatory actions , which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments . additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations . government actions , including trade protection and national and economic security policies of u.s . and foreign government bodies , such as tariffs , import or export regulations , including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of u.s . persons , trade and economic sanctions , decrees , quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products , provide services to our customers and employees , do business without an export license with entities on the u.s . department of commerce ’s u.s . entity list or other usg restricted parties lists ( which is expected to change from time to time ) , and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business . if we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the u.s . or similar applicable non - u.s . laws , even if the violation occurred without our knowledge , we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws , any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business , operating results and financial condition . for example , in response to the war in ukraine , the united states and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products , services and support into russia , belarus , and certain regions of ukraine . in fiscal year [XXXX] , we stopped direct sales to russia and closed business operations in russia . concurrently , the war in ukraine has impacted sales in emea and may continue to do so in the future . the increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of ai technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating ai and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings . concerns regarding third - party use of ai for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of ai applications , models , and solutions , has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training , modifying , tuning , and deploying llms . such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire , deploy and use systems that include our products , software , and services , and negatively impact our business and financial results . such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to ai technologies . as geopolitical tensions have increased , semiconductors associated with ai , including gpus and associated products , are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the u.s . and its allies . the united states has imposed unilateral controls restricting gpus and associated products , and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted . such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application , prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets , including but not limited to china , and could negatively impact our manufacturing , testing and warehousing locations and options , or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business , revenue and financial results . export controls targeting gpus and semiconductors associated with ai , which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened , would further restrict our ability to export our technology , products , or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions , creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results . export controls targeting gpus and semiconductors associated with ai have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use , resale , repair , or transfer of our products , negatively impacting our business and financial results . controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as nvidia ai cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their end customers , even outside china . export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels , negatively impacting our ability to serve demand , including in markets outside china and for our gaming products . the possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products , benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls . repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers , negatively and materially impacting our business . increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services , negatively impacting our business and financial results . reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges . additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets , but also provoke responses from foreign governments , including china , that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide , which could also substantially reduce our revenue . regulators in china have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the china market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our mellanox acquisition . if the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in china , we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business , any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business , operating results and financial condition . during the third quarter of fiscal year [XXXX] , the usg announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting china ’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries . these restrictions impact exports of certain chips , as well as software , hardware , equipment and technology used to develop , produce and manufacture certain chips to china ( including hong kong and macau ) and russia , and specifically impact our a100 and h100 integrated circuits , dgx or any other systems or boards which incorporate a100 or h100 integrated circuits . the licensing requirements also apply to any future nvidia integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip - to - chip i / o performance thresholds , as well as any system or board that includes those circuits . there are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products , including networking products , destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in china . during the second quarter of fiscal year [XXXX] , the usg also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of a100 and h100 products destined to certain customers and other regions , including some countries in the middle east . in october [XXXX] , the usg announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year [XXXX] for exports to china and country groups d1 , d4 , and d5 ( including but not limited to , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , and vietnam , but excluding israel ) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds , including a100 , a800 , h100 , h800 , l4 , l40 , l40s and rtx [XXXX] . the licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in , or with an ultimate parent headquartered in , country group d5 , including china . on october [XX] , [XXXX] , the usg informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our a100 , a800 , h100 , h800 , and l40s products . we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to china . following these export controls , we transitioned some operations , including certain testing , validation , and supply and distribution operations out of china and hong kong . any future transitions could be costly and time consuming , and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations , as well as our revenue , during any such transition period . we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer new solutions , including those for which the usg does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment . to the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements , we may seek a license for the customer . however , the licensing process is time - consuming . we have no assurance that the usg will grant such a license or that the usg will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all . even if a license is offered , it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users can not or decide not to accept . the usg is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review . for example , the notified advanced computing , or “ nac , ” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in china . the license process for exports to d1 and d4 countries has been time - consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside china . the requirements have a disproportionate impact on nvidia and already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage nvidia against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products . management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming . our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed , over the long - term , if there are further changes in the usg ’s export controls , including further expansion of the geographic , customer , or product scope of the controls , if customers purchase product from competitors , if customers develop their own internal solution , if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations , if the usg does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs . even if the usg grants any requested licenses , the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users can not or choose not to fulfill . the licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors , as the licensing process will make our pre - sale and post - sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in china to pursue alternatives to our products , including semiconductor suppliers based in china , europe , and israel . given the increasing strategic importance of ai and rising geopolitical tensions , the usg has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements , negatively impacting our business and financial results . in the event of such change , we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements , effectively excluding us from all or part of the china market , as well as other impacted markets , including the middle east . for example , the usg has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large - scale gpu clusters , for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries , or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair gpus if certain system or use conditions are detected . the usg has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming gpus , and if the usg expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products , it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside china , including the u.s . and europe . export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products , which are warehoused in and distributed from hong kong . export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter gpus may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our gpus . the usg may also impose export controls on our networking products , such as high - speed network interconnects , to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training . any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on nvidia and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control . excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside china and other impacted regions to “ design - out ” certain u.s . semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk , and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide . excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than nvidia or other u.s . firms , harming our business , market position , and financial results . as a result , excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in china , but also in other markets , such as europe , latin america , and southeast asia . excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in u.s . advanced semiconductor products , because by the time a new product is ready for market , it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale . at the same time , such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors , which would be less likely to be restricted by u.s . controls . additionally , restrictions imposed by the chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our gaming revenue , and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our data center revenue . the chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products , or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers . for example , the chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by micron , a supplier of ours . further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results . finally , our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners , especially in taiwan . any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components , parts , or services from taiwan , would negatively impact our business and financial results . increased scrutiny from shareholders , regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us . shareholder advocacy groups , certain investment funds , other market participants , shareholders , customers and government regulators have focused increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures , including those associated with climate change and human rights . stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption . further , there is an increasing number of state - level initiatives in the u.s . that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders ’ expectations . additionally , our corporate sustainability practices , oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder , regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations , or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards . we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor , report , and comply with various corporate sustainability practices , choose not to conduct business with potential customers , or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies . these factors may negatively harm our brand , reputation and business activities or expose us to liability . issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies , including ai in our offerings , may result in reputational or financial harm and liability . concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies , such as ai , in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues . we are increasingly building ai capabilities and protections into many of our products and services , and we also offer stand - alone ai applications . ai poses emerging legal , social , and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption , and therefore our business . if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society , such as ai solutions that have unintended consequences , infringe copyright or rights of publicity , or are controversial because of their impact on human rights , privacy , employment or other social , economic or political issues , or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of ai models and systems offered through our sales channels , we may experience brand or reputational harm , competitive harm or legal liability . complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to ai could increase our cost of doing business , may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions , or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations . compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of ai , including in jurisdictions such as the european union as well as under any u.s . regulation adopted in response to the biden administration ’s executive order on ai , may also increase the cost of related research and development , and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements . for example , regulation adopted in response to the executive order on ai could require us to notify the usg of certain safety test results and other information . furthermore , changes in ai - related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices , which may negatively impact our financial results . our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of ai by us or others could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm . actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products . from time to time , we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other ip rights violations by us , our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify . an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages , invalidation of one or more patents , indemnification of third parties , payment of lost profits , or injunctive relief . claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others , regardless of their merit , could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to , defend , and resolve such claims , and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel . we may commence legal proceedings to protect our ip rights , which may increase our operating expenses . we could be subject to countersuits as a result . if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party ’s ip , we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party ’s ip rights . if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all , we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products . we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology . if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms , our business could be negatively impacted . furthermore , the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results . we rely on patents , trademarks , trade secrets , employee and third - party nondisclosure agreements , licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our ip . foreign laws may not protect our products or ip rights to the same extent as united states law . this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely . the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products ; as a result , the value of our investment in research and development , product development and marketing could be reduced . we also may face risks to our ip if our employees are hired by competitors . we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but can not be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved , and , if approved , whether they will be enforceable . we are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws , rules , regulations and other obligations . these areas could damage our reputation , deter current and potential customers , affect our product design , or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability . we process sensitive , confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws , regulations , industry standards , external and internal policies , contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf . concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection , use , retention , security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy - related matters , including for use in ai , even if unfounded , could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results . the theft , loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation , regulatory proceedings , disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims . in the united states , federal , state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws , including for data breach notification , personal data privacy and consumer protection . in the past few years , numerous u.s . states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses , including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data . as applicable , such rights may include the right to access , correct , or delete certain personal data , and to opt - out of certain data processing activities , such as targeted advertising , profiling and automated decision - making . the exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services . certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data , including sensitive information , such as conducting data privacy impact assessments . these state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance . for example , the california consumer privacy act of [XXXX] , as amended by the california privacy rights act of [XXXX] , or cpra , or collectively the ccpa , gives california residents the right to access , delete and opt - out of certain sharing of their personal information , and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared . the ccpa provides for fines of up to $ [X,XXX] per intentional violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches . similar laws are being considered in several other states , as well as at the federal and local levels . additionally , several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services . if we become subject to additional data privacy laws , the risk of enforcement action against us could increase . worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection . the european union adopted the general data protection regulation , or gdpr , and the united kingdom similarly adopted the u.k . gdpr , governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the european economic area , or eea , and the united kingdom , respectively , including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access , correct , and delete such data about themselves . if we are found not to comply , we could be subject to penalties of up to € [XX] million or [X] % of worldwide revenue , whichever is greater , and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data . furthermore , the eu ai act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices . in the ordinary course of business , we may transfer personal data from europe , china , and other jurisdictions to the united states or other countries . certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross - border personal data transfer laws . for example , the gdpr generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the eea . the european commission released a set of “ standard contractual clauses ” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the eea to jurisdictions that the european commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection , including the united states . additionally , the u.k . ’s international data transfer agreement / addendum , as well as the eu - u.s . data privacy framework and the u.k . extension thereto ( which allows for transfers to relevant u.s.-based organizations who self - certify compliance and participate in the framework ) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the eea and u.k . to the united states . however , these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges , and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the united states . other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross - border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws , any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators . for example , china ’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization . data broadly defined as important under china ’s law , including personal data , may not be transferable outside of china without prior assessment and approval by the cyberspace administration of china , or cac . compliance with these requirements , including cac assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments , could cause us to incur liability , prevent us from using data collected in china or impact our ability to transfer data outside of china . the inability to import personal data to the united states could significantly and negatively impact our business operations , limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to european , china and other data privacy and security laws , or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense . some european regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of europe for allegedly violating the gdpr ’s cross - border data transfer limitations , which could negatively impact our business . we may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security , and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non - compliant . for example , certain privacy laws , such as the gdpr and the ccpa , require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers . we sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers , and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data , it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation , regulatory action , or fines . we publish privacy policies , marketing materials and other statements , such as compliance with certain certifications or self - regulatory principles , regarding data privacy and security . if these policies , materials or statements are found to be deficient , lacking in transparency , deceptive , unfair or misrepresentative of our practices , we may be subject to investigation , enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences . data protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices . these obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies , systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf . despite our efforts , we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with such obligations . if we fail , or are perceived to have failed , to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations , we could face significant consequences , including but not limited to , government enforcement actions , litigation , additional reporting requirements and/or oversight , bans on processing personal data , and orders to destroy or not use personal data . any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation , business , or financial condition . we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws , higher than expected tax rates and other tax - related factors . we are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations , as well as non - income - based taxes , in various jurisdictions . significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities . we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions . although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable , any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate , increase the amount of non - income taxes imposed on our business , and harm our financial position , results of operations , net income , and cash flows . further , changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the u.s . or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts , which may materially impact our results of operations , or the way we conduct our business . most of our income is taxable in the united states , with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign - derived intangible income , or fdii . if u.s . tax rates increase or the fdii deduction is reduced , our provision for income taxes , results of operations , net income and cash flows would be adversely affected . in addition , changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and pillar two model rules announced by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd . these and other changes in the foreign tax laws , as adopted by countries , may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes , results of operations , and financial condition . our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors , including changes in our business or statutory rates , the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates , available tax incentives , credits and deductions , the expiration of statutes of limitations , changes in accounting principles , adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns , increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes , the estimates of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances , changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations , the impact of accounting for business combinations , as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure . furthermore , the tax effects of accounting for stock - based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur . a decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock - based compensation , increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results . our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation , investigations and regulatory proceedings . we currently and will likely continue to face legal , administrative and regulatory proceedings , claims , demands and/or investigations involving shareholder , consumer , competition and/or other issues relating to our business . for example , we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in [XXXX] and [XXXX] . litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain , and adverse rulings could occur , including monetary damages or fines , or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products , engaging in certain business practices , or requiring other remedies , such as compulsory licensing of patents . an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact . regardless of the outcome , litigation can be costly , time - consuming , and disruptive to our operations . our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations , and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations . as of january [XX] , [XXXX] , we had net outstanding a total of $ [X.X] billion in notes due by [XXXX] . as each series of senior notes matures , unless redeemed or repurchased , we must repay or refinance the notes . if we decide to refinance , we may receive less favorable terms , or we may be unable to refinance at all , which may adversely affect our financial condition . we also have a $ [XXX] million commercial paper program . maintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments ; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic , industry and competitive conditions ; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry ; impair our ability to obtain future financing ; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property , enter into certain mergers , dispose of our assets , or materially change our business . our ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control . if we breach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders , then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable . changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities , restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing . delaware law and our certificate of incorporation , bylaws and agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control . the anti - takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage , delay , or prevent a change in control . provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock . these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock , change the number of directors , and to make , amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval ; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings ; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals ; and a super - majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws . under our agreement with microsoft for the xbox , if someone makes an offer to purchase at least [XX] % of our outstanding common stock , microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock . these provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia , discourage proxy contests , and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire ."

efficient ai acceleration and local inference on the pc . ▪ we introduced the 13th gen intel ® core ™ mobile processor family , led by the launch of the first [XX] - core processor for laptops , and introduced the new intel vpro ® platform powered by the full lineup of 13th gen intel core processors . ▪ we introduced the 14th gen intel ® core ™ desktop processor family , delivering fast desktop frequencies and enhanced desktop experience for enthusiasts . ▪ we launched the 4th gen intel ® xeon ® scalable processors , a critical part of our heterogeneous hardware and software portfolio to accelerate real - world data center , cloud and edge workloads , including ai , and also launched the 4th gen intel xeon scalable processors with intel ® vran boost , a new general - purpose chip that fully integrates layer [X] acceleration into the xeon soc and is designed to eliminate the need for external accelerator cards . ▪ we launched the 5th gen intel ® xeon ® scalable processors for data center , cloud , and edge , with embedded capabilities for powering ai workloads . ▪ we introduced two new intel ® arc ™ pro graphics processing units , intel arc pro a60 and intel pro a60 m , and shipped intel arc pro a40 - based systems . investing in leading - edge , at - scale manufacturing we are committed to strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leading - edge semiconductor products by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity . in the us , we are expanding our existing operations in arizona , new mexico , and oregon , and investing in two new leading - edge chip factories in ohio . we have submitted all four of our major project proposals in arizona , new mexico , ohio , and oregon , estimated to represent over $ [XXX] billion of us manufacturing and research investments over the next five years , to the us department of commerce 's chips program office . in the european union and israel , we have announced a series of investments , spanning our existing operations in ireland and israel , as well as our planned investment of more than $ [XX] billion in germany to build a leading - edge wafer fabrication mega - site , and our plans to invest up to $ [X.X] billion in an assembly and test facility in poland . we also announced the start of high - volume manufacturing using intel [X] technology and euv technology in ireland . unlocking value we continue to look for innovative ways to unlock value for our stakeholders . we sold a [XX.X] % minority stake in our ims nanofabrication business , including investments from bain capital and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ( tsmc ) . net proceeds resulting from the ims minority stake sales totaled $ [X.X] billion . we also executed a secondary offering of mobileye stock that generated net proceeds of $ [X.X] billion . further , we communicated our intent to operate our programmable solutions group ( psg ) as a standalone business , with standalone financial reporting beginning january [X] , [XXXX] . this is expected to enable potential private and public equity investments . these transactions provide an additional source of capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our strategy . # # table_start fundamentals of our business # # table_end table of contents # # table_start our strategy # # table_end technology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence . as we look ahead to the next decade , we expect to see continued demand for processing power . semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion , and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity . the demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers : ubiquitous compute , pervasive connectivity , cloud - to - edge infrastructure , ai , and sensing . together these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other , and will exponentially increase the world 's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever - smaller microchips . we intend to lead the industry by harnessing these superpowers for our customers ' growth and our own . we are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon , platforms , and software , and packaging and process technology with at - scale manufacturing . with these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption , our strategy to win is focused on four key themes : product leadership , open platforms , manufacturing at scale , and our people . our priorities # # table_start product leadership # # table_end lead and democratize compute with intel x86 and xpu . our product offerings provide end - to - end solutions , scaling from data center to network , pcs , edge computing , and the emerging fields of ai and autonomous driving , to serve an increasingly smart and connected world . at our core is the x86 computing ecosystem , which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications , with billions of lines of code written and optimized for x86 cpus . we continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance , which push the limits of low latency and single - threaded application performance , and microarchitectures focused on efficiency , which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance . beyond the cpu , we are delivering a growing family of xpu products , which encompass client and data center gpus , ipus , fpgas , and other accelerators . the xpu approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures , and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers ' increasingly diverse computing needs . as part of our strategy , we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories . we also seek to address every phase of the ai continuum , including the largest , most challenging genai and large language models . we believe ai represents a generational shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems . we are in the early stages of realizing ai 's full potential and genai is just the beginning . our strategy is to bring ai to where the data is being generated and used and we believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms , offering open and modular solutions , for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and ai everywhere . we are infusing ai into intel technologies , supporting today 's genai workloads , fueling emerging usages like ai pc and ai at the edge , and pioneering innovations that we believe advance the future of ai in the next decade . we believe our leadership in ip , process , packaging , security , software , services , manufacturing , and foundry services positions us to realize ai 's full potential to transform industries and solve the world 's biggest challenges . # # table_start fundamentals of our business # # table_end table of contents # # table_start open platforms # # table_end we aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry - defining standards . around the globe , companies are building their networks , systems , and solutions on open standards - based platforms . intel has helped set the stage for this movement , with our historic contributions in developing standards such as cxl , thunderbolt ™ , and pci express * . we also contributed to the design , build , and validation of open - source products in the industry such as linux * , android * , and others . the world 's developers constantly innovate and expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability , reliability , and security . in addition , microservices have enabled the development of flexible , loosely coupled services that are connected via application programming interfaces to create end - to - end processes . we use industry collaboration , co - engineering , and open - source contributions to accelerate software innovation . through our oneapi initiative , developers use a unified language across cpus , gpus , and fpgas that is designed to reduce development time and to enhance productivity . we also deliver a steady stream of open - source code and optimizations that are designed for projects across virtually every platform and usage model . we are committed to co - engineering and jointly designing , building , and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work better together . our commitment extends to developers through our developer - first approach based on openness , choice , and trust . ultimately , we believe our pivot to a software - defined , silicon - enhanced strategy will enable us to realize value at all layers of the compute stack . this should allow us to continue to monetize foundational and ecosystem - enabling software through hardware sales , limited licensing , and customer - enabling service offerings . additionally , we are expanding our software portfolio by developing and monetizing software solutions , services , and platforms with saas , software subscriptions , and other business models . we are prioritizing three portfolios of offerings for our saas and subscription -

us jurisdictions and a change in tax law from [XXXX] tax reform related to the capitalization of r&d expenses that went into effect in january [XXXX] . in [XXXX] we recognized a benefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in [XXXX] as the higher proportion of our income being taxed in non - us jurisdictions and the change in tax law from [XXXX] tax reform were only partially offset by the tax costs associated with the gains recognized from the equity sale of mcafee and the divestiture of our nand memory business . in [XXXX] the oecd announced an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting including pillar two model rules defining the global minimum tax , which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of [XX] % . subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued . many non - us tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the pillar two model rules beginning in [XXXX] ( including the european union member states ) with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years . we are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact pillar two model rules in the non - us tax jurisdictions we operate in . liquidity and capital resources we believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next [XX] months and in the longer term . cash generated by operations , supplemented by our total cash and investments [X] , is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements . these sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other smart capital initiatives that we have undertaken . our short - term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test , including investments in our process technology roadmap ; working capital requirements ; and potential and pending acquisitions , strategic investments , and dividends . our long - term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology . these plans include expanding existing operations in arizona , ireland , israel , new mexico , and oregon , and investing in new leading - edge manufacturing facilities in germany and ohio . we also expect to continue to benefit from government incentives and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our investments . conversely , incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements . we expect our planned capital investments to continue to put pressure on our adjusted free cash flow in the short term . as we invest in multiple expansions , we expect our capital expenditures to continue to be higher than historical levels for the next several years . we expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had commitments for capital expenditures of $ [XX.X] billion for [XXXX] and had $ [X.X] billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , other purchase obligations and commitments in [XXXX] under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $ [X.X] billion , with an additional $ [X.X] billion committed in the long term . we have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business , beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services . for example , see "" note [XX] : commitments and contingencies "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our lease obligations , which include supply agreements structured as leases ; "" note [X] : income taxes "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our tax obligations , including impacts from tax reform enacted in [XXXX] for the one - time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings ; and "" note [XX] : borrowings "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our debt obligations . the expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information . timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different , depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services , or changes to agreed - upon amounts for some obligations . in addition , some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above . for example , some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons . # # table_start md&a # # table_end when assessing our current sources of liquidity , we include our total cash and investments [X] as follows : # # table_start ( in millions ) dec [XX] , [XXXX] dec [XX] , [XXXX] cash and cash equivalents $ [X,XXX] $ [XX,XXX] short - term investments [XX,XXX] [XX,XXX] loans receivable and other [X] [XXX] total cash and investments [X] $ [XX,XXX] $ [XX,XXX] total debt $ [XX,XXX] $ [XX,XXX] # # table_end [X] see "" non - gaap financial measures "" within md&a . we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer , industry , and country . substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in investment - grade securities . our sources of liquidity in [XXXX] included $ [X.X] billion from partner contributions , net proceeds of $ [X.X] billion from a secondary offering of mobileye class a common stock , $ [X.X] billion of cash proceeds from the sale of minority stakes in our ims business to both bain capital and tsmc , and government incentives of $ [X.X] billion . other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec , pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt , equity , other securities , and non - recourse factoring arrangements with third - party financial institutions . under our commercial paper program , we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $ [XX.X] billion and , as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding . during [XXXX] , we issued a total of $ [XX.X] billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes , including , but not limited to , refinancing our outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures . we also amended both our five - year $ [X.X] billion variable - rate revolving credit facility agreement , extending that maturity date by one year to march [XXXX] , and our [XXX] - day $ [X.X] billion credit facility agreement , extending the maturity date to march [XXXX] . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities . in q1 [XXXX] , we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock . this dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation , is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy , and is designed to position us to create long - term value . in january [XXXX] , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $ [X.XXX] per share on the company 's common stock , which will be payable on march [X] , [XXXX] to stockholders of record as of february [X] , [XXXX] . future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our board of directors . our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity , among other factors , for our strategic business requirements . in [XXXX] these actions included , among others , negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions , adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections , managing inventory levels and purchasing practices , and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non - recourse basis to third - party financial institutions . while such actions have benefited , and may further benefit , cash flow in the near term , we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these actions reverse or normalize . our cash flows for each period were as follows : # # table_start years ended ( in millions ) dec [XX] , [XXXX] dec [XX] , [XXXX] dec [XX] , [XXXX] net cash provided by operating activities $ [XX,XXX] $ [XX,XXX] $ [XX,XXX] net cash used for investing activities ( [XX,XXX] ) ( [XX,XXX] ) ( [XX,XXX] ) net cash provided by ( used for ) financing activities [X,XXX] [X,XXX] ( [X,XXX] ) net increase ( decrease ) in cash and cash equivalents $ ( [X,XXX] ) $ [X,XXX] $ ( [X,XXX] ) # # table_end operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non - cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . for [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] , the $ [X.X] billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower [XXXX] net income after adjusting for non - cash items , partially offset by [XXXX] cash - favorable working capital changes compared to [XXXX] . for [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] , the $ [XX.X] billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower [XXXX] net income after adjusting for non - cash items , including the gain on the sale of mcafee and the pre - tax gain from the divestiture of our nand business , partially offset by [XXXX] cash - favorable working capital changes compared to [XXXX] . # # table_start md&a # # table_end investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures ; investment purchases , sales , maturities , and disposals ; proceeds from capital - related government incentives ; and proceeds from divestitures . our capital expenditures were $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] ( $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] and $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] ) . the increase in cash used for investing activities in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] was primarily due to a lack of proceeds from the divestiture of our nand business and from the sale of our remaining mcafee share that occurred in [XXXX] , lower maturities and sales of short - term investments , and increased capital expenditures . these unfavorable cash flow impacts during [XXXX] were partially offset by higher [XXXX] proceeds from capital - related government incentives and by other cash favorable investment activities , including lower acquisitions during [XXXX] . the decrease in cash used for investing activities in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] was primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short - term investments , proceeds from the divestiture of our nand business , and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of mcafee , partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures . financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders , issuance and repayment of short - term and long - term debt , and proceeds from partner contributions and equity - related issuances . the increase in cash provided by financing activities in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] was primarily due to higher debt issuances along with lower repayment of long - term debt , decreased dividend payments to stockholders , and increased proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares , partially offset by commercial paper issuances in [XXXX] that were subsequently repaid in [XXXX] . our total dividend payments were $ [X.X] billion in [XXXX] , compared to $ [X.X] billion in [XXXX] . we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past [XXX] quarters . cash provided by financing activities in [XXXX] compared to cash used for financing activities in [XXXX] was primarily due to higher commercial paper and debt issuances , our [XXXX] curtailment of common stock repurchases , proceeds from the mobileye ipo , and partner contributions for joint investments , partially offset by higher [XXXX] debt repayments . critical accounting estimates the methods , assumptions , and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain . we consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if : ( [X] ) we must make assumptions that are uncertain when the judgment is made , and ( [X] ) changes in the estimate assumptions , or selection of a different estimate methodology , could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements . while we believe that our estimates , assumptions , and judgments are reasonable , they are based on information available when the estimate was made . refer to "" note [X] : accounting policies "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates , which are as follows , as well as our significant accounting policies : ▪ inventories — the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory , net of factory excess capacity costs . inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering forecasted future demand and market conditions ; ▪ long - lived assets — the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment and evaluation of useful lives of property , plant , and equipment ; identified intangibles ; and impairment of goodwill , including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units ; and ▪ loss contingencies — the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable . # # table_start md&a # # table_end non - gaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with us gaap , this document contains references to the non - gaap financial measures below . we believe these non - gaap financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance , enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance , and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance . these non - gaap financial measures are used in our performance - based rsus and our cash bonus plans . our non - gaap financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items , as well as the related income tax effects . beginning in [XXXX] , income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long - term projected tax rate of [XX] % across all adjustments . we project this long - term non - gaap tax rate on an annual basis using a five - year non - gaap financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment . the projected non - gaap tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure , our tax positions in various jurisdictions , and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate . this long - term non - gaap tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons , including the rapidly evolving global tax environment , significant changes in our geographic earnings mix , or changes to our strategy or business operations . management uses this non - gaap tax rate in managing internal short- and long - term operating plans and in evaluating our performance ; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance . prior - period non - gaap financial measures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this updated approach . our non - gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for , or superior to , financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap , and the financial results calculated in accordance with us gaap and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated . # # table_start non - gaap adjustment or measure definition usefulness to management and investors nand memory business we completed the first closing of the divestiture of our nand memory business to sk hynix on december [XX] , [XXXX] and fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in the nand opco business in q1 [XXXX] . we exclude the impact of our nand memory business in certain non - gaap measures . while the second closing of the sale is still pending and subject to closing conditions , we deconsolidated this business in q1 [XXXX] and management does not view the historical results of the business as a part of our core operations . we believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view , through the eyes of management , of our core business model and how management currently evaluates core operational performance . in making these adjustments , we have not made any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or other financial statement amounts . acquisition - related adjustments amortization of acquisition - related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology , brands , and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations . charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and mg&a in our us gaap financial statements . amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset , and thus are generally recorded over multiple years . we exclude amortization charges for our acquisition - related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions . these adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends . share - based compensation share - based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans . we exclude charges related to share - based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because we believe these adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance . we believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view , through the eyes of management , of our core business model , how management currently evaluates core operational performance , and additional means to evaluate expense trends , including in comparison to other peer companies . # # table_end # # table_start md&a # # table_end # # table_start non -

gaap results ; amortization related to the right to use the patents in the current and ongoing periods is included . we exclude the catch - up charge related to prior periods for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past operating results and provides a useful evaluation of our current operating performance . optane inventory impairment a charge in [XXXX] as we initiated the wind - down of our intel optane memory business . we exclude these impairments for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because these charges do not reflect our current operating performance . this adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results . restructuring and other charges restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements . other charges may include periodic goodwill and asset impairments , certain pension charges , and costs associated with restructuring activity . [XXXX] includes a benefit as a result of developments in the vlsi litigation in q4 [XXXX] , an ec - imposed fine , and a fee related to the termination of our agreement to acquire tower . [XXXX] includes a benefit related to the annulled ec fine and [XXXX] includes a charge related to the vlsi litigation . we exclude restructuring and other charges , including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods , for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance . these adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends . ( gains ) losses on equity investments , net ( gains ) losses on equity investments , net consists of ongoing mark - to - market adjustments on marketable equity securities , observable price adjustments on non - marketable equity securities , related impairment charges , and the sale of equity investments and other . we exclude these non - operating gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because it provides better comparability between periods . the exclusion reflects how management evaluates the core operations of the business . ( gains ) losses from divestiture ( gains ) losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture , or over a specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the time of closing . based on our ongoing obligation under the nand wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first closing of the sale of our nand memory business on december [XX] , [XXXX] , a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between first and second closing . we exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non - gaap measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance . these adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results . adjusted free cash flow we reference a non - gaap financial measure of adjusted free cash flow , which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity , capital resources , and quality of earnings . adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for ( [X] ) additions to property , plant , and equipment , net of proceeds from capital - related government incentives and partner contributions , ( [X] ) payments on finance leases , and ( [X] ) proceeds from the mcafee equity sale in [XXXX] . this non - gaap financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business . since the [XXXX] divestiture , mcafee equity distributions and sales contributed to prior operating and free cash flow , and while the mcafee equity sale in q1 [XXXX] would have typically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as an equity sale , we believe including the sale proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better , more consistent comparison to current and past presentations of liquidity . total cash and investments total cash and investments is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity , which include cash and cash equivalents , short - term investments , and loans receivable and other . this non - gaap measure is helpful in understanding our capital resources and liquidity position . # # table_end # # table_start md&a # # table_end following are the reconciliations of our most comparable us gaap measures to our non -

k , including in the md&a and financial statements and supplemental details sections . we are in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry . the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological , geopolitical , and market developments ; changes in industry standards ; changes in customer and end - user needs , expectations , and preferences ; and frequent product introductions and improvements . when we do not anticipate or respond to these developments , our competitive position can weaken , and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete . our competitive environment has intensified in recent years , and we expect it to continue to do so in the future . if we are not able to compete effectively , or if our foundry strategy is unsuccessful , our financial results will be adversely affected , including through reduced revenue and gross margin , and we may be required to accelerate the write - down of the value of certain assets . we face intense competition across our product portfolio . our competitors include companies offering platform products , such as amd and qualcomm ; accelerator products such as gpus , including those offered by nvidia ; other accelerator products such as asics , application - specific standard products , and fpgas ; memory and storage products ; connectivity and networking products ; and other semiconductor products . some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms , such as the arm architecture * , and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale . for example , arm - based products are being used in pcs and servers , which could lead to further development and growth of the arm ecosystem . we also compete with internally developed semiconductors from oems , cloud service providers , and others , some of whom are customers . some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads . for example , in [XXXX] , apple introduced pc products utilizing its own internally developed arm - based semiconductor designs in place of our client cpus , and we face increasing competition from apple 's products and ecosystem . most of our competitors rely on third - party foundries , such as tsmc or samsung , for the manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products . manufacturing process and assembly and test improvements introduced by such foundries have contributed , and may continue to contribute , to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors . our process technology roadmap to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by [XXXX] is subject to a number of risks , and we could fail to realize our goals , including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps , changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology , and the risks described in the risk factor "" the development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties . "" as an idm , we have higher capital expenditures and r&d spending than many of our fabless competitors due to the high ongoing investments required to maintain leading - edge process technology and manufacturing capacity . we also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through , for example , acquisitions or business collaborations , as well as new entrants , including in china , which could have a significant impact on our competitive position . for example , we could face increased competition as a result of china 's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains . our products compete based on a number of factors , including performance , energy efficiency , ease - of - integration , ease - of - use , innovative design , features , workload optimization , price , quality , reliability , security , software ecosystem and developer support , time - to - market , reliable product roadmap execution , brand recognition , customer support and customization , and availability . the importance of these factors varies by product and market segment . to the extent our products do not meet our customers ' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape , our business and results of operations can be harmed . introduction of competitive new products and technologies , aggressive pricing , and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products , exert downward pricing pressure on our products , and adversely affect our business . for example , our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment . further , our dcai revenue , platform asps and market share were negatively impacted by the competitive environment and the shift of customer spend towards gpus during the past few years . additionally , a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred in recent years , and more could occur in the future . consolidation could also lead to fewer customers , partners , or suppliers , any of which could negatively affect our financial results . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we have limited experience in the highly competitive and capital - intensive third - party foundry business . as we pursue our strategy to establish ifs as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others , we will face intense competition from well - established competitors such as tsmc , samsung , global foundries ( gf ) , united microelectronics corporation ( umc ) , and semiconductor manufacturing international corporation ( smic ) . to succeed , we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time - to - market of manufacturing technology ; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance , performance per watt , and density ; multi - chip packaging ; system integration ; manufacturing capacity ; price ; margin ; ease of use ; quality ; yields ; customer satisfaction ; and ecosystem support . building and maintaining a competitive foundry business requires high ongoing investments to maintain leading - edge process technology and manufacturing capacity , which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped . moreover , many of the largest potential ifs customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own . as a result , our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality information , intellectual property , and foundry capacity , among other competitive concerns , to attract and retain such customers . our limited third - party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading - edge and legacy nodes . our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of , regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon , and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities . our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor , materials , and equipment . increasing demand for such sources , including from other foundries ; supply constraints , labor shortages , and other adverse market conditions ; issues with permits or approvals ; on - site incidents ; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects , as well as legal and reputational harm . these significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain . we are making significant , long - term and inherently risky investments in r&d and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return . to compete successfully , we must maintain an effective r&d program , develop new products and manufacturing processes , improve our products and processes , and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities , all ahead of competitors and market demand . the r&d efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies . we incurred r&d expenses of $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] , $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] , and $ [XX.X] billion in [XXXX] . we are focusing our r&d efforts across several key areas , including process and packaging technology , our xpu products and features , ai , and software . these include ambitious initiatives , such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies , or nodes , in four years and our unified oneapi portfolio of developer tools . our investments are typically long - term and , even where successful , often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years . we can not guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate , including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors . for example , we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our [XX] nm process technology , and during [XXXX] , we announced that our then [X] nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations . in such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance , performance per watt , transistor density , die utilization , core counts , and/or new features such as optimizations for ai and other workloads , with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency , relative to competing foundry processes , we have faced and will face cost , product performance , and time - to - market disadvantages relative to our competitors and adverse impacts to our financial condition as a result of higher operating costs , including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity , higher leverage and borrowing costs , and pressure on our credit ratings . further , we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products , including as a result of bugs , late changes to features due to customer requests , or other design challenges . for example , in [XXXX] , we announced that the release of intel 's 4th gen intel xeon scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of [XXXX] to the second half of [XXXX] . to the extent our r&d efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance , performance per watt , die utilization , and core counts , and/or with new features such as optimizations for ai and other workloads , our competitive position can be harmed . we have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products , in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package . this approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability , particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies , several of which are novel , have a limited manufacturing history , and/or have increased costs . delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products . for example , adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional r&d expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end the investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical levels . in recent years , the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utilizing leading process technologies , including as a result of the use of euv photolithography tools . our ownership and operation of such high - tech fabrication facilities , and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand , has resulted and will continue to result in our incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term . such capital outlays and costs include those related to utilization of existing facilities , facility construction and equipment , r&d , and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce . to the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver or demand for our products , foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately , our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure , which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors . we could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charges , which would also lower our gross margin and operating income . to the extent the demand decrease is prolonged , our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized , and we may be required to write down our long - lived assets , which would increase our expenses . we may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under - used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation . as we continue to make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our idm [X.X] strategy , these underutilization risks may be heightened . conversely , at times , demand may increase or we may fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded . to the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough , we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand , which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share , legal claims , and/or damage to customer relationships . the development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties . we are continually engaged in the development of next - generation technologies . forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging , and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process , challenges in using new materials or new production equipment , and other issues . diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time , as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes , and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially anticipated . we are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes . we experienced significant delays in implementing our [XX] nm process technology , and in [XXXX] , we encountered a defect mode in the development of our then [X] nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations . in [XXXX] , intel 's 4th gen intel xeon scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time . these delays have allowed competitors using third - party foundries , such as tsmc , to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us , including improvements in performance , energy efficiency , and other features , which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products . because of these prior delays in our process technologies , we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products . our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks , including difficulties in designing and developing next - generation process and packaging technologies , and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance . we can not guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next - generation process technologies , including the expected cost , performance , power , and density advantages , or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and r&d investments , particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive . in such circumstances , we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities , increasing our expenses . risks inherent in the development of next - generation process technologies include production timing delays , lower - than - anticipated manufacturing yields , longer manufacturing throughput times , failure to achieve expected performance , power , and area improvements , and product defects and errata ( deviations from published specifications ) . production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows , which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships . furthermore , when the introduction of next - generation process nodes is delayed , adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products , manufacturing supply constraints , and increased product costs . lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times , compared to previous process nodes , can increase our product costs , adversely affect our gross margins , and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints . a new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields , and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes . as the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk , our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata , which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products . our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges , particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies , including third - party foundries ' process technologies . to combine components in a single package , they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities , while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields , throughput times , and capacity constraints . we may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others . delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product . in addition , the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues . to the extent we are unable to manage these risks , our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end from time to time , disruptions in the production process result from errors ; defects in materials ; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses ; interruptions in our supply of materials , resources , or production equipment ; adverse changes in equipment productivity ; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents , maintenance issues , power interruptions , equipment malfunctions , or unsafe working conditions — all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in production timing delays . production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand , which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations . our implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses , products , and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed . our idm [X.X] strategy requires implementation of new business strategies , as well as many internal structural , systems and process changes . we have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand , ubiquitous compute , pervasive connectivity , cloud to edge infrastructure , ai , and sensing . in recent years , we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete gpus , mobility solutions , ai accelerators , ipu products , and silicon photonics . as part of our idm [X.X] strategy , we announced plans to establish ifs as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes , systems , and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product - based business units . the implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural , system , and process changes to support the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business , including a new erp system . in parallel , we are undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business , such as psg and ims , to raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities . significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful . for example , in [XXXX] , we wound down intel optane ; in [XXXX] , we agreed to sell our nand memory business to sk hynix ; and in [XXXX] , we exited the [X] g smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses . these new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity , and they also introduce new sources of competition , including , in some cases , incumbent competitors with established technologies , ecosystems , and customer bases , lower prices , margins , or costs , and greater brand recognition . these developing products and market segments require significant investment , do not always grow as projected or at all , or sometimes adopt competing technologies , and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments . for example , ai and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology , but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads , or if our customers use competing technologies , we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas . similarly , we expect intense competition related to the significant opportunity we see in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge and may not succeed in our efforts . to be successful , we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings . despite our ongoing efforts , there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments , which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges , as well as opportunity costs . our smart capital approach to capital spending , alternative financing arrangements and pursuit of government grants involves risks and may not be successful . as we pursue our idm [X.X] strategy , we have utilized our smart capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and scale our capital investments . to support our capital investments , we have pursued alternative financing arrangements , such as our [XXXX] joint investment with brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our arizona campus , and expect to enter into similar arrangements in the future . these transactions may fail to advance our business strategy , may include unfavorable pricing or other terms , and may fail to achieve their anticipated benefits . our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to resolve any potential disputes . any of these risks , including our ability to effectuate any additional transactions at all , could have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition , or cash flows , which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital for our required investments . in addition , as part of our smart capital approach , we have applied for , received , and expect to receive additional grants and incentives from domestic and foreign local , regional and national governments . legislation in the us and eu has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions , but there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to the conditions and restrictions that may apply to us as a recipient of such funding . for example , we expect to receive substantial grants from the us government under the chips act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in the us and the german government under the eu chips act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in germany . however , governments may choose not to award grants and incentives in sufficient amounts or in a timely manner to support our capital investment plans and to offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as compared to those of many of our competitors , or we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of such grants and incentives . to the extent such funding is below our expectations , we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements , or we are required to return any amounts received from any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations contained therein , our anticipated cash requirements would increase . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results . our products are used in different market segments , and demand for our products varies within or among them . it is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact . for example , we expect the pc tam to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base , demand for ai capabilities , new platforms , shorter replacement cycles , and adoption in new markets ; however , the pc industry has been highly cyclical in the past , and these growth expectations may not materialize , or we may fail to capitalize on them . changes in the demand for our products , particularly our ccg , dcai , and nex platform products , have in the past and may in the future reduce our revenue , lower our gross margin , or require us to write down the value of our assets . important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include : ▪ business conditions , including downturns in the market segments in which we operate , or in global or regional economies ; ▪ consumer confidence , income levels , and customer capital spending , which can be impacted by changes in market conditions , including changes in government borrowing or spending , taxation , interest rates , the credit market , current or expected inflation , employment , and energy or other commodity prices ; ▪ geopolitical conditions , including trade policies and geopolitical tensions and conflicts ; ▪ our ability to timely introduce competitive products ; ▪ competitive and pricing pressures , including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors ; ▪ the level of our customers ' inventories and computing capacity ; ▪ customer order patterns and order cancellations , including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products , customers ' products , and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles ; and disruptions affecting customers , such as the delays in obtaining tools , components , and other supplies as a result of covid-19 - related port shutdowns in china that negatively impacted demand for our business in [XXXX] , as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in [XXXX] ; ▪ market acceptance and industry support of our products and services , including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our products , such as software to harness the new ai capabilities of our latest cpus , as well as our foundry services offerings through ifs ; and ▪ customer product needs and emerging technology trends , including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end - user computing workloads , such as work- and learn - from - home trends . our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs . for example , our core product offerings range from lower - priced and entry - level platforms , such as those based on intel atom processors , to higher - end platforms based on intel xeon processors . our ancillary product offerings that extend beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher - priced products , and at times are not profitable . to the extent demand shifts from our higher - priced to lower - priced core products in any of our market segments , or our ancillary products represent a greater share of our mix of products sold , our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again . macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts , including changes to trade policies and regulations , present significant risks to us in many jurisdictions . we have manufacturing , assembly and test , r&d , sales , and other operations in many countries , and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas . our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed , and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more geographic areas . moreover , sales outside the us accounted for [XX] % of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december [XX] , [XXXX] , with revenue from billings to china contributing [XX] % of our total revenue . as a result , our operations and our financial results , including our ability to execute our business strategy , manufacture , assemble and test , design , develop , or sell products , and the demand for our products , are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control . adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur , including recession or slowing growth ; changes or uncertainty in fiscal , monetary , or trade policy ; higher interest rates ; tighter credit ; inflation ; lower capital expenditures by businesses , including on it infrastructure ; increases in unemployment ; and lower consumer confidence and spending . adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions , including regarding prioritization of investments in our business . an economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks , higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets , reduced liquidity , adverse impacts on our suppliers , failures of counterparties , including financial institutions and insurers , asset impairments , and declines in the value of our financial instruments . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs , trade barriers , and other protectionist measures , which can increase our manufacturing costs , make our products less competitive , reduce demand for our products , limit our ability to sell to certain customers , limit our ability to procure components or raw materials , or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders . increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations , domestic sourcing initiatives , or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in , or restrict our access to , some markets . they can also result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession , and could cause our customers to reduce , cancel , or alter the timing of their purchases with us . sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long - term changes in global trade and technology supply chains , domestic sourcing initiatives , and decoupling of global trade networks , which could make it more difficult to sell our products in , or restrict our access to , some markets and have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects . in particular , geopolitical and trade tensions between the us and china , one of our largest markets , have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions , including tariffs applicable to some of our products , and have affected customer ordering patterns . further , the us has imposed restrictions on the export of us - regulated products and technology to certain chinese technology companies , including certain of our customers . specifically , in [XXXX] the us significantly increased us export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and on artificial intelligence and advanced computing products . in [XXXX] , the us added to the restrictions in all three areas and also worked with japan and the netherlands to align on additional restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment . during this time , the us has increasingly added chinese companies to prohibited lists . in response , china has restricted us access to certain minerals and has blocked certain companies that provide products to taiwan 's military from selling products in china . these restrictions have in some instances reduced our sales and in a number of instances required specific governmental authorizations or exceptions - $ [X.X] billion , or [X] % , of our [XXXX] revenue was dependent upon us government export control authorizations , an amount that we expect may increase in future years . these and potential future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance and result in reputational harm to us . in addition , a number of semiconductor companies in china , including semiconductor manufacturing international corporation ( smic ) , are making significant investments , in many instances with the support of the chinese government , in advanced semiconductor technologies to enable such companies to develop products and technologies that compete with ours . it is difficult to predict what further trade - related actions governments may take , the extent to which we may be able to mitigate the effects of any such actions , and the longer - term implications of such actions on the market opportunities for us and the competition we may face . we can also be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur , including : ▪ geopolitical and security issues , such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest , political instability , human rights concerns , and terrorist activity , including , for example : ▪ russia ’s war with ukraine , initiated in [XXXX] , which resulted : in the imposition of financial and other sanctions and export controls against russia and belarus that caused us and other companies to limit or suspend russian operations ( we had no exports to russia in [XXXX] ) ; russia - imposed currency restrictions and regulations and other retaliatory trade and other actions ; increased supply , commodity , and other costs ; and increased risk of cyberattacks ; ▪ tensions and conflict affecting israel , where we have multiple semiconductor development centers and a leading - edge manufacturing facility and where our mobileye business is headquartered and has most of its operations , and in surrounding areas , such as past conflicts in lebanon and the current conflict in the red sea ; and ▪ rising tensions between china and taiwan ; ▪ natural disasters , public health issues ( including pandemics ) , and other catastrophic events ; ▪ inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions , such as supply chain interruptions , materials shortages or delays , and large - scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities , transportation , data hosting , or telecommunications providers ; ▪ formal or informal imposition of new or revised export , import , or doing - business regulations , including trade sanctions , tariffs , and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses , which could be changed without notice ; ▪ government restrictions on , or nationalization of , our operations in any country , or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from or distribute compensation or other funds in a particular country ; ▪ adverse changes relating to government grants , tax credits , or other government incentives , including more favorable incentives provided to competitors ; ▪ differing employment practices and labor issues , including restricted access to talent ; ▪ ineffective legal protection of our ip rights in certain countries ; ▪ local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices ; ▪ continuing uncertainty regarding social , political , immigration , and tax and trade policies in the us and abroad ; and ▪ fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments , and in the capital and credit markets , which can be negatively affected by liquidity , credit deterioration or losses , interest rate changes , financial results , political risk , sovereign risk , or other factors . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we are subject to numerous risks associated with the evolving market for products with ai capabilities . the markets and use cases for products with ai capabilities have been rapidly evolving , are difficult to predict and may impact demand for our products . for example , in the last few years the demand for high - end gpus for model training increased dramatically and has resulted and may continue to result in a significant shift in dcai customer spend . the significant investments we have made to develop products and software to address what we believe will be increasing demand for ai capabilities may be insufficient , and we face significant hurdles , including whether demand will materialize , whether third - party developers will develop the software to utilize the ai capabilities of our products , and whether we will be successful in developing products that can compete with offerings by established competitors . our use of ai technology may subject us to reputational , financial , legal , or regulatory risks . as we incorporate ai technology into our products and services , any failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of the evolving ai technology in our products and services may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability and , as such , may increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and issues . ai technology may create ethical issues , generate defective algorithms , and present other risks that create challenges with respect to its adoption . in addition , evolving rules , regulations , and industry standards governing ai may require us to expend significant resources to modify , maintain , or align our business practices or products to comply with us and non - us rules and regulations , the nature of which can not be determined at this time . several jurisdictions around the globe , including the eu and certain us states , have already proposed or enacted laws governing ai . us federal agencies are likely to release ai regulations in the near future in light of the biden administration ’s october [XX] , [XXXX] executive order on ai . the regulatory environment surrounding the impact of the implementation of ai on our products and services may adversely affect our ability to produce and export products and as a result may cause harm to our reputation and financial liability . we rely upon a complex global supply chain . we have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers . these suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes ; supply tools , equipment , and ip ( via licenses ) for our factories ; deliver logistics and packaging services ; and supply software , lab and office equipment , and other goods and services used in our business . we also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products . from time to time , we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues , including : ▪ suppliers extending lead times , experiencing capacity constraints , limiting or canceling supply , allocating supply to other customers including competitors , delaying or canceling deliveries , or increasing prices ; ▪ supplier quality issues ; ▪ cybersecurity events , ip or other litigation , man - made or natural disasters , public health issues ( including pandemics ) , operational failures , or other events that disrupt suppliers ; ▪ long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers , or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers ; and ▪ increased legislation , regulation , or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices , such as heightened reporting and other obligations with regard to environmental impacts , the risk of forced labor , or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards , which can result in supply chain disruptions , the loss of a supplier , and the government seizure of goods . these and other supply chain issues can increase our costs , disrupt or reduce our production , delay our product shipments , prevent us from meeting customer demand , damage our customer relationships , or negatively affect our reputation . they may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business , competitive position , results of operation , and financial condition . from time to time , our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products . during the past several years , macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions , as well as outbreaks of covid-19 , caused supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining tools and other components , and the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity . these shortages have previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses , and have adversely affected customer demand for our products , as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third - party components used together with our products to produce finished systems . it is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur . to obtain future supply of certain materials and components , particularly substrates , and third - party foundry manufacturing capacity , we have entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long - term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments . these arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements , or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all , or their financial condition may deteriorate . if future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements falls below our expectations , we could have excess or obsolete inventory , unneeded capacity , and increased costs , and our prepayments may not be fully utilized , and in some cases may not be fully recoverable . we utilize third - party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking , communications , graphics , programmable semiconductor solutions , and memory . as part of our idm [X.X] strategy , we expect to increase our use of third - party foundries . delays in the development of foundries ’ future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes , and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand . we typically have less control over delivery schedules , design and manufacturing co - optimization , yields , quality , product quantities , and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end where possible , we seek to have several sources of supply . however , for certain components , services , materials , and equipment , we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers , or upon suppliers in a single location , which can impact the nature , quality , availability , and pricing of the products and services available to us . for example , asml holding n.v . ( asml ) is currently the sole supplier of euv photolithography tools that we are deploying in our intel [X] and subsequent manufacturing process nodes . these tools are highly complex to develop and produce , and increasingly costly , and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability , which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes . as a further example , a limited number of third - party foundries offer leading - edge manufacturing processes , and these providers are geographically concentrated in asia . supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers . we are subject to the risks of product defects , errata , or other product issues . from time to time , we identify product defects , errata , and other product issues , which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes . components and products we purchase or license from third - party suppliers , or gain through acquisitions , can also contain defects . product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third - party products and software . we face risks if products that we design , manufacture , or sell , or that include our technology , cause personal injury or property damage , even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata . these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices , market segments , technologies , or applications , including transportation , autonomous driving , healthcare , communications , financial services , and other industrial , critical infrastructure , and consumer uses . costs from defects , errata , or other product issues could include : ▪ writing off some or all of the value of inventory ; ▪ recalling products that have been shipped ; ▪ providing product replacements or modifications ; ▪ providing consideration to customers , including reimbursement for certain costs they incur ; ▪ defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages ; ▪ paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies ; and ▪ reputational harm . these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin , and/or result in delay or loss of revenue . mitigation techniques designed to address product issues , including software and firmware updates , are not always available on a timely basis — or at all — and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications . we and third parties , such as hardware and software vendors , make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address , which can delay , limit , or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs . product defects , errata , or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures , adverse performance and power effects , reboots , system instability or unavailability , loss of functionality , data loss or corruption , unpredictable system behavior , decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features , and other issues . product issues can damage our reputation , negatively affect product demand , delay product releases or deployment , result in legal liability , or make our products less competitive , which could harm our business and financial results . subsequent events or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of a product issue . in addition , our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred . our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim , and losses not covered by insurance could be large , which could harm our financial condition . we face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products . we or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products , as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them . components and ip we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products , as well as industry - standard specifications we implement in our products , are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities . our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks , including applications that gather and process large amounts of data , such as the cloud or internet of things , and critical infrastructure and automotive applications . the security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side - channel vulnerabilities , such as the variants referred to as "" spectre "" and "" meltdown . "" additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified . publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in , and is expected to continue to result in , increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities . security and manageability features in our products can not make our products absolutely secure , and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities . vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known . we , our customers , and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability , including the extent , if any , to which a vulnerability has been exploited . subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability , including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates , become aware of additional variants , evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products , and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations , as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities in our products , including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures , are not always available on a timely basis — or at all — and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications . in addition , we are often required to rely on third parties , including hardware , software , and services vendors , as well as our customers and end users , to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques , and the availability , effectiveness , and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether , when , and how to develop and deploy mitigations . export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists , potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation . further , sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure , which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them . we and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address , which can delay , limit , or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation . security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects , reboots , system instability or unavailability , loss of functionality , data loss or corruption , unpredictable system behavior , decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features , and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties . security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations , financial condition , customer relationships , prospects , and reputation in a number of ways , any of which may be material . for example , whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits , they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations , writing down inventory value , defending against product claims and litigation , responding to regulatory inquiries or actions , paying damages , addressing customer satisfaction considerations , providing product replacements or modifications , or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties . adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services . these effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products . moreover , third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available , which , in turn , could lead to attempted or successful exploits , adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations , or otherwise harm our business and reputation . we are subject to increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks . we face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to : the breadth of geographies , networks , and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks ; the complexity , technical sophistication , value , and widespread use of our systems , products and processes ; the attractiveness of our systems , products and processes to threat actors ( including state - sponsored organizations ) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers ; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material cybersecurity incident ; and our use of third - party products , services and components . such an incident , whether or not successful , could result in our incurring significant costs related to , for example , rebuilding our internal systems , writing down inventory value , implementing additional threat protection measures , providing modifications to our products and services , defending against litigation or enforcement proceedings , paying damages , providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us , or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties , as well as incurring significant reputational harm . we regularly face attempts by malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers , customers , partners , end users , or other third parties ; steal proprietary , personal , or confidential information related to our business , products , employees , suppliers , or customers ; introduce malicious software to our systems or those of our suppliers , customers , partners , end users , or other third parties ; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers , customers , or others ; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services . as we grow certain emerging business lines , such as our foundry business and our cloud computing and software - as - a - service offerings , we expect to collect or host significant amounts of highly sensitive customer data , which may increasingly make us a target of attempts to steal or corrupt that data . individuals and organizations , including malicious hackers , state - sponsored organizations , insider threats including employees and third - party service providers , and intruders into our physical facilities , at times attempt to gain unauthorized access to and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services . we are also a frequent target of attackers that intend to sabotage , compromise , take control of , or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes , products , and services . in some instances , we , our suppliers , our customers , and the users of our products and services may be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects , or we may be unable to timely mitigate the impacts of an incident . cyber attack attempts are increasing in number , magnitude , and technical sophistication , and if successful may expose us and the affected parties to loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions to our business operations , including our manufacturing operations , and could impact our financial results . we expect emerging technologies to contribute to the increasing sophistication of attacks and to lead to new threats . for example , threat actors may leverage emerging ai technologies to develop new hacking tools and attack vectors , exploit vulnerabilities , obscure their activities , and increase the difficulty of threat attribution . as a developer of leading - node processes and widely utilized products , we have been , and expect to continue to be , the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries , including state - sponsored organizations , who seek to compromise our systems , disrupt our operations or those of users of our products , or steal trade secrets . as geopolitical or armed global conflicts escalate , attacks against us , our customers , or our strategic allies may similarly intensify . for example , from [XXXX] to [XXXX] , we , along with other companies with meaningful operations in israel , were targets of concerted cyberattacks . in the fourth quarter of [XXXX] , our habana labs subsidiary ’s network was breached in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack , resulting in unauthorized third - party access of certain confidential information . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we are also subject to risks associated with attacks on products , services and components in our supply chain , such as the [XXXX] compromise of it infrastructure management software provided by solarwinds corporation . these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products , or provide inadequate updates or support , which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information . since [XXXX] , we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain . in december [XXXX] , a vulnerability named “ log4shell ” was reported for the widely used java logging library , apache log4j * [X] , and similar vulnerabilities affecting commonly used programs and tools were reported in [XXXX] and [XXXX] . we are required to comply with stringent , complex , and evolving laws , rules , regulations , and standards in many jurisdictions , as well as contractual obligations , relating to cybersecurity and data privacy . our compliance efforts are complicated by the fact that these requirements and obligations may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement , and may conflict among various jurisdictions . any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws , rules , regulations , standards , certifications , or contractual obligations , or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to , or unauthorized loss , destruction , use , modification , acquisition , disclosure , release , or transfer of personal information , may result in outcomes such as : requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices ; the expenditure of substantial costs , time , and other resources ; proceedings or actions against us ; legal liability ; governmental investigations ; enforcement actions ; claims ; fines ; judgments ; awards ; penalties ; sanctions ; and potentially costly litigation ( including class actions ) . the theft , loss , or misuse of personal data collected , used , stored , or transferred by us to run our business , including data stored with vendors or other third parties , could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims . costs to comply with and implement privacy - related and data - protection measures are significant , and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties , damage to our reputation , suspension of online services or sites in certain countries , and even criminal sanctions . even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal , state , or international privacy - related or data - protection laws and regulations could result in audits , regulatory inquiries , or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties . we are subject to ip risks , including related litigation and regulatory proceedings . we can not always protect our ip or enforce our ip rights . we regard our patents , copyrights , trade secrets , and other ip rights as important to the success of our business . we rely on ip law — as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers , employees , technology development partners , and others — to protect our ip and ip rights . our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks , as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries and other geopolitical factors . we are not always able to obtain protection for our ip or enforce or protect our ip rights . when we seek to enforce our rights , we may be subject to claims that our ip rights are invalid , not enforceable , or licensed to an opposing party . our assertion of ip rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us , which could harm our business . from time to time , governments adopt regulations — and governments or courts render decisions — requiring compulsory licensing of ip rights , or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies . our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business . in some cases , our ip rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations . in addition , the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products ; as a result , the value of our investment in r&d , product development , and marketing could be reduced . this risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees . our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights . technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements . some of our competitors have in the past had , and may in the future have , licenses to some of our patents , and under current case law , some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances . our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry - standard specifications . depending on the rules of the organization , government regulations , or court decisions , we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost , and as a result , we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others , and the value of our ip rights may be impaired . third parties assert claims based on ip rights against us and our products , which could harm our business . we face claims based on ip rights from individuals , companies , investment litigation entities , other non - practicing entities , academic and research institutions , and other parties . we have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well - funded non - practicing entities , including entities funded by third - party investment firms . these lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business , impact our reputation or relationship with customers , and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products . the patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non - competitors . as a result , we believe we are facing a more hostile ip litigation environment than in past years . we are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving ip rights . claims that our products , technologies , or processes infringe the ip rights of others , regardless of their merits , cause us to incur large costs to respond to , defend , and resolve the claims , and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations . in addition , we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third - party trade secrets , confidential information , or end - user data that we obtain in conducting our business . any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business , and we could suffer losses , including the cost of product recalls and returns , and reputational harm . furthermore , in many instances we agree to indemnify customers for certain ip rights claims against them . ip rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers ' businesses , which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end as a result of ip rights claims , we could : ▪ pay monetary damages , payments to satisfy indemnification obligations , royalties , fines , or penalties ; ▪ stop manufacturing , using , selling , offering to sell , or importing products or technology subject to claims ; ▪ need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims , which could be time - consuming or costly ; and/or ▪ enter into settlement or license agreements , which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly . these ip rights claims could harm our competitive position , result in expenses , or require us to impair our assets . if we alter or stop production of affected items , our revenue could be harmed . we rely on access to third - party ip , which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms , if at all . many of our products are designed to include third - party technology or implement industry standards , which may require licenses from third parties . in addition , from time to time , third parties notify us that they believe we are using their ip . there is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our existing licenses to such third - party ip can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all . failure to obtain the right to use third - party technology , or to license ip on commercially reasonable terms , could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results . to the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open - source software , we may be required to make the software 's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open - source licensing terms . we are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters . from time to time , we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder , consumer , competition , commercial , ip , labor and employment , compliance , and other issues . as described in "" note [XX] : commitments and contingencies "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements , we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters . litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain , and adverse rulings , excessive verdicts , or other events could occur , including monetary damages , fines , penalties , or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products , engaging in certain business practices , or requiring other remedies , such as compulsory licensing of patents . an unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business , financial condition , and results of operations . regardless of the outcome , litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly , time - consuming , disruptive to our operations , harmful to our reputation , and distracting to management . we must attract , retain , and motivate key talent . we believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives , scientists , engineers , technical talent , sales representatives , and other professionals are critical to our business . the competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense , with the demand often exceeding supply . competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees , and the availability of flexible , hybrid , or work - from - home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition . in addition , changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent . from time to time , we have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent , such as during [XXXX] and 1h [XXXX] , and these efforts have increased our expenses . further , we may not be successful in attracting , retaining , and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy , and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring and reduce our workforce to respond to business conditions that differ from our expectations , which can be disruptive , compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goals , and impact our ability to recruit in the future . changes in employment - related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs . to help attract , retain , and motivate qualified employees , we use share - based awards , such as rsus , and performance - based cash incentive awards . sustained declines in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to our competitors have been reducing the retention value of our share - based awards , which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation . our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice . to the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive , or changes in our workforce and related restructuring , reduction - in - force or other initiatives are not viewed favorably , our ability to attract , retain , and motivate employees can be weakened , which could harm our results of operations . in addition , significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and culture , as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures , including due to the loss of historical , technical , and other expertise . changes in our management team and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations . to the extent we do not effectively hire , onboard , retain , and motivate key employees , our business can be harmed . we are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions and investments . we routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions , divestitures , and other strategic transactions , which are an important component of our financial allocation strategy . these transactions involve numerous risks , including : ▪ our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us ; ▪ failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize ; ▪ disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management 's attention ; ▪ failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely ; ▪ our inability to exercise sole decision - making authority regarding a project , property , or entity ; ▪ failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner , or at all , due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals on a timely basis or without materially burdensome conditions or mandated acquisitions , divestitures , or disposals , ip disputes or other litigation , difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us , or other unforeseen factors ; # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end ▪ our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment , potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets , and restructuring charges ; ▪ our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses ; ▪ our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority - owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating or separating employees , business systems , and technology or otherwise operating the acquired or majority - owned business ; ▪ controls , processes , and procedures of acquired or majority - owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations and create complexity and inconsistency in application of controls , processes and procedures , and our failure to identify and/or address compliance issues , including accounting errors , or liabilities ; ▪ our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners , including as a result of differences in our interests or goals ; ▪ our failure to identify , or our underestimation of , commitments , liabilities , accounting and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets , majority - owned businesses or novel transactions ; and ▪ the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt . any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , financial condition , or cash flows , particularly in the case of a large acquisition , divestiture or partial divestiture , or several concurrent strategic transactions . moreover , our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs ; accordingly , if we pursue a particular transaction , we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives . where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities , we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options . we may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms ; changes in market , macroeconomic , or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate ; changes in applicable laws ; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals ; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approvals , litigation , contractual terms , or other conditions ; delays in closing ; lack of support by third parties ; actions by competitors ; adverse effects on our business relationships , operating results , or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transactions ; and continued financial obligations , unanticipated liabilities , or transition costs associated with such transactions . in some cases , we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all . in addition , we make investments in public and private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives . these companies can include early - stage companies still defining their strategic direction . many of the instruments in which we invest are non - marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment , and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion , if at all . our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company , if any , is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event , such as a public offering or acquisition . to the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful , which at times includes bankruptcy , we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment . we are subject to sales - related risks . we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties . we sell a significant portion of our products through third parties , such as distributors , value - added resellers , and channel partners ( collectively referred to as distributors ) , as well as oems and odms . we depend on many distributors to help us create end - customer demand , provide technical support and other value - added services to customers , fill customer orders , and stock our products . at times , we rely on one or more key distributors for a product , and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue . our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited . in addition , our distributors ' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor ; as a result , end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor . using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks , including competitive pressure and concentration , credit , and compliance risks . distributors and other third parties often sell products that compete with our products , and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products . from time to time , they may face financial difficulties , including bankruptcy , which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results . further , any violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by distributors or other third - party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business , including subjecting us to litigation or regulatory risk . failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales , increase expenses , and weaken our competitive position . from time to time , our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized "" gray market . "" our policies and procedures designed to keep our products away from the gray market may not be successful in achieving this objective . gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies , which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities . gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging . gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged , and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard . we receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers . collectively , our three largest customers accounted for [XX] % of our net revenue in [XXXX] , [XX] % of our net revenue in [XXXX] and [XX] % of our net revenue in [XXXX] . we expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end industry trends , such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud , have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers , particularly hyperscalers , in some of our data center - focused businesses . the cloud and cloud applications represent an increasingly demanding computing environment . the further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud , and consolidation among cloud service providers , can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments ; optimization for cloud services and applications ; product performance ; energy efficiency ; feature differentiation ; product quality , reliability , and factors affecting server uptime ; and product security and security features . our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors . we are operating in an increasingly competitive environment , including serving cloud service provider customers , and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in dcai in [XXXX] and [XXXX] . some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed , and may continue to develop , their own semiconductors , including designs customized for their specific computing workloads . in addition , cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications , or they can abstract hardware under layers of software , which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users . the shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected , and may continue to affect , sales to enterprise customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads from their own internal data center infrastructures to cloud service providers . to the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications , order changes , delays , or cancellations may result in non - recoverable costs . the loss of key customers , a substantial reduction in sales to them , or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue , increase the volatility of our results , and harm our results of operations and financial condition . for information about our customers who accounted for greater than [XX] % of our net consolidated revenue , see "" note [X] : operating segments "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements . we face risks related to transactions with government entities . we receive proceeds from both us and non - us governments associated with grants , incentives , and sales of our products and services , and we are seeking to increase our sales of products and services to governmental entities in the future . government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations , including , with respect to us government contracts , congressional approval of appropriations , and can be adversely impacted by shutdowns of the us federal government . government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award , administration , and performance of those contracts , as well as oversight and penalties for violations . for example , certain agreements with the us government are subject to special rules on accounting , ip rights , expenses , reviews , information handling , security , customers , and/or employees , and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions , including termination of contracts , fines , and suspension or debarment from future business with the us government . we face risks related to our debt obligations . as we pursue our idm [X.X] strategy , we have incurred significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial condition , including our ability to fully implement our strategy . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , we had $ [XX.X] billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and other borrowings outstanding . in addition , we have a commercial paper program of up to $ [XX.X] billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to $ [XX.X] billion . as we continue to pursue our idm [X.X] strategy , we expect to incur additional indebtedness , refinance our existing debt , and issue additional notes or other debt securities in the future at a variety of interest rates , maturities , and terms . the semiconductor industry is a cyclical business and our revenue , cash flows , and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle , as well as prevailing macroeconomic conditions , our business strategy , and other risks described in these risk factors . these fluctuations , together with our debt level and related debt service obligations , could have the effect of , among other things , reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings that can potentially impact the value of our outstanding debt and increase our borrowing costs . we may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital , capital expenditures , debt service obligations , debt refinancing , future acquisitions , or other general corporate purposes , which will depend on , among other factors , our financial position and performance , as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control . consequently , we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us , or at all , which could adversely impact our ability to finance our business strategy and service and repay outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due , all of which could adversely impact our business , financial condition , and the cost of borrowing . we have significantly reduced our return of capital to stockholders in recent years . in recent years , we have not made repurchases of our stock and reduced the amount of our quarterly dividend . there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current level , or at all . in addition , we are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program and there can be no assurances as to the amount , timing , and execution of any future share repurchases , or that any repurchases will enhance long - term stockholder value . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business . we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions and affect our operations in areas including , but not limited to : ip ownership and infringement ; tax ; import and export requirements ; anti - corruption ; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions ; data privacy and localization requirements ; competition ; advertising ; employment and labor ; product regulations ; environment , health , and safety requirements ; and consumer laws . compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively . for example , unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to [X] g or autonomous driving technology and maas may limit global adoption , impede our strategy , or negatively impact our long - term expectations for our investments in these areas . expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy - related and data - protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services , particularly in cloud , internet of things , and ai applications , which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads . our policies , controls , and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws can not provide assurance that our employees , contractors , suppliers , or agents will not violate such laws or our policies . violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines ; criminal sanctions against us , our officers , or our employees ; prohibitions on the conduct of our business ; and damage to our reputation . the technology industry is subject to intense media , political , and regulatory scrutiny , which can increase our exposure to government investigations , legal actions , and penalties . we are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates . we are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates . although most of our sales occur in us dollars , expenses may be paid in local currencies . an increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars , and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll , utilities , tax , and marketing expenses , as well as non - us dollar capital expenditures . we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies . our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any , or more than a portion , of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements ; therefore , changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition . changes in our effective tax rate may impact our net income . a number of factors can impact our future effective tax rate or cash payments , which could cause significant variability in our financial results including : ▪ changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates ; ▪ changes in our business or legal entity operating model ; ▪ the resolution of issues arising from tax audits , including payment of interest and penalties ; ▪ changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities , and in deferred tax valuation allowances ; ▪ adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of tax returns ; ▪ increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes , including impairments of goodwill ; ▪ changes in available tax credits , including non - us tax credits , r&d credits and refundable tax credits ; ▪ expirations or changes in our ability to secure new tax holidays and incentives ; ▪ changes in us federal , state , or foreign tax laws or their interpretation , including the global implementation of a minimum tax under pillar two of the oecd beps initiative ; ▪ changes in us gaap ; and ▪ our decision to repatriate non - us earnings for which we have not previously provided for incremental taxes including any local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation . catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results . our operations and business , and those of our customers and suppliers , can be disrupted by natural disasters ; industrial accidents ; public health issues and global pandemics such as covid [XX] ; cybersecurity incidents ; interruptions of service from utilities , transportation restrictions or disruptions , telecommunications , or it systems providers ; manufacturing equipment failures ; geopolitical conflict ; terrorism ; or other catastrophic events . for example , we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages , improperly functioning equipment , and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components , including cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers . our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters . global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity , such as drought , wildfires , storms , sea - level rise , and flooding , and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities , including our facilities located in water - sensitive regions such as arizona and israel . in addition , to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources , our reputation could be harmed . in recent years , the west coast of the us has experienced significant wildfires , including in oregon , where we have major manufacturing facilities , and in california , where we are headquartered . the long - term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end catastrophic events including global pandemics could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers , receive production materials from our suppliers , or perform critical functions , which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations . the covid-19 pandemic previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted historical patterns related to demand for our products and services that may impact our ability to accurately predict future demand , trends , or other matters that may impact our financial performance . while we maintain business recovery plans , some of our systems are not fully redundant and we can not be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions . furthermore , even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly , if our customers or suppliers can not timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event , we may experience reduced or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations . we are subject to risks associated with environmental , health , safety , and product regulations . the design , manufacturing , assembly and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental , health , and safety laws and regulations . our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor ( e.g. , mining conflict minerals ) , and restrictions on other materials , as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities , sale and distribution of our products , and use of our real property . the scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations , including the materials they govern , are complex and continue to evolve . the procedures and processes in place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and can not guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to whom such laws apply . the amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations , as well as our failure or inability to comply with them ( including as a result of acquired entities ) can result in regulatory penalties , fines , and legal liabilities ; increased costs ; additional remediation obligations ; suspension of production ; alteration , suspension , or termination of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes , including due to an inability to find , afford , or attain adequate substitute materials , equipment , or processes ; damage to our reputation ; and restrictions on our operations or sales . in addition , the failure or inability to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes and sources , and result in increased risks and costs . the failure or inability by us or our customers and suppliers to manage the use , transportation , emissions , discharge , storage , recycling , or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities . environmental regulations , including with respect to the materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and wastewater requirements , may impede our ability to manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future . environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment , modify product designs , cease the use of a particular material or process , remove or remediate hazardous substances , or incur other expenses or liabilities . regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements . for example , semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons , which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions . new or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds , or other greenhouse gas emissions , could require us to install additional abatement equipment , purchase carbon offsets , and/or alter , where feasible , our production processes and sources . in addition , new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs , for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities . regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( pfas ) , which are found in parts , components , process chemicals and other materials used in semiconductor manufacturing . such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited technically and commercially feasible alternatives to them . as we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our idm [X.X] strategy , the impacts of future regulation could be magnified . many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are also subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations . these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes . our initiatives and new legal requirements with respect to corporate responsibility matters present various risks . our corporate responsibility initiatives , including our rise strategy and related goals , could expose us to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial , legal , reputational , operational , compliance , and other risks , including lost customer opportunities , which could negatively impact us . our achievement of initiatives , aspirations , and goals related to corporate responsibility matters , including those related to sustainability , is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions , risks , and expectations ; as well as standards , processes , and methodologies that continue to evolve . further , any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders ' evolving expectations could also negatively impact us . in addition , we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate - related and other sustainability laws and regulations , including , for example , the state of california 's new climate change disclosure requirements , the eu 's new corporate sustainability reporting directive and proposed climate - change disclosure requirements from the sec . compliance with such laws and regulations , as well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from the sec and other regulators , investors , customers , vendors , employees , and other stakeholders concerning esg and climate matters , could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks , including resulting in changes to our current esg goals . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end sales and marketing customers we sell our products primarily to oems , odms , and cloud service providers . odms provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private - label resellers . in addition , our customers include other manufacturers and service providers , such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor , reseller , retail , and oem channels throughout the world . for information on customers who accounted for greater than [XX] % of our net consolidated revenue , see "" note [X] : operating segments "" within the notes to consolidated financial statements . our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers — systems builders that purchase intel processors and other products from our distributors . certain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets . sales arrangements our products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world . sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing , payment terms , and warranties , as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products , such as patent and copyright indemnities . because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis , they can typically cancel , change , or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty . from time to time , we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering , for example , changes from our standard terms and conditions , new product development and marketing , and private - label branding . our sales are routinely made using electronic and web - based processes that allow customers to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered . pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors . we also offer discounts , rebates , and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology . in accordance with contract terms , the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location , as determined by the agreed - upon shipping terms . our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date , usually [XX] days after shipment or delivery . we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis . from this analysis , we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices , such as obtaining a parent guarantee , standby letter of credit , or credit insurance . credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy , fraud , or other failure of the customer to pay . our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise . under the price protection program , we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer . our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection , nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted . the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor . distribution distributors typically handle a wide variety of products , including those that compete with our products , and fill orders for many customers . customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors . we have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers . seasonal trends historically , our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year , accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter . in [XXXX] , continued strong covid - driven notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe . in [XXXX] , we had a flatter trend than we historically observe as we experienced the uncertainty and impacts , including demand volatility and supply chain disruption , of macroeconomic conditions , the potential for a recession , and the risk for continued covid - related disruptions or shutdowns . in [XXXX] , our net revenue seasonality was more consistent with our historical pre - pandemic trend . marketing our global marketing objectives are to build a strong , well - known , differentiated , and meaningful intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers , and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases . the intel core processor family and the intel atom , celeron ® , pentium ® , intel ® movidius ™ , and intel xeon trademarks make up our key cpu brands . this year we introduced our new intel ® core ™ ultra processors , powering the latest ai pcs , and our 5th gen intel xeon processors , built with ai acceleration in every core . we also continue to bring to market new software services including independent attestation security with intel ® trust authority , intel ® granulate ™ for workload compute optimization , and intel developer cloud to accelerate ai development . our foundry services business aims to offer leading - edge packaging and process technology , geographically balanced manufacturing capacity and a world - class ip portfolio . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing , as well as through co - marketing programs . our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television , as well as consumer and trade events , industry and consumer communications , and press relations . we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products . our key messaging focuses on increased performance , improved energy efficiency , and other capabilities such as connectivity . certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs . these cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing . certain customers are licensed to place intel ® logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies , and to use our brands in their marketing activities . the program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands , subject to customers meeting defined criteria . these marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television , as well as press relations . we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates , as well as equity and commodity prices . our risk management programs are designed to reduce , but may not eliminate , the impacts of these risks . all of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december [XX] , [XXXX] and december [XX] , [XXXX] . actual results may differ materially . currency exchange rates we are exposed to currency exchange risks of non - us - dollar - denominated investments in debt and equity instruments , and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts , such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps . gains or losses on these non - us - currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments . substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars . however , a portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies , primarily the israeli shekel , the malaysian ringgit , the european union euro , the japanese yen , and the chinese yuan . we have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non - us - dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non - us - dollar monetary assets and liabilities . we may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency - denominated future investments . we may utilize foreign currency contracts , such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs . we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of [XX] % in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term . such an adverse change , after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of december [XX] , [XXXX] and december [XX] , [XXXX] , would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $ [XX] million and less than $ [XX] million , respectively . interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed - rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt . the primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields , which generally track the sofr . we generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed - rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into sofr - based returns . we also entered into swaps to convert fixed - rate coupon payments into floating - rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness . gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments . a hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of [X] % , after taking into account investment hedges , would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our investment portfolio of less than $ [XXX] million as of december [XX] , [XXXX] and as of december [XX] , [XXXX] . taking into account fixed - rate debt that is swapped to floating - rate debt , a hypothetical increase in interest rates of [X] % would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $ [XXX] million from debt outstanding as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ( a hypothetical increase of [X] % would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $ [XXX] million from debt outstanding as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ) . equity prices we are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities , which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $ [X.X] billion ( $ [X.X] billion as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ) . the substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of december [XX] , [XXXX] was concentrated in securities traded on the chinese shanghai stock exchange science and technology innovation board . to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities , we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio . assuming a decline of [XX] % in market prices , the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by $ [XXX] million , based on the value as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ( a decrease in value of $ [XXX] million , based on the value as of december [XX] , [XXXX] using an assumed decline of [XX] % ) . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end we utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements . gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities . many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non - marketable equity investments , although we can not always quantify the impacts directly . financial markets are volatile , which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in , their ability to raise additional capital , and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as ipos , mergers , and private sales . these types of investments involve a great deal of risk , and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful ; consequently , we could lose all or part of our investment . our non - marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $ [X.X] billion as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ( $ [X.X] billion as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ) and include our investment in beijing unisoc technology ltd . of $ [X.X] billion ( $ [X.X] billion as of december [XX] , [XXXX] ) . commodity price risk although we operate facilities that consume commodities , we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree . we have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices . we may use commodity derivatives contracts , such as commodity swaps , in these hedging programs . in addition , we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities . cybersecurity we face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to : the breadth of geographies , networks , and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks ; the complexity , technical sophistication , value , and widespread use of our systems , products and processes ; the attractiveness of our systems , products and processes to threat actors ( including state - sponsored organizations ) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers ; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material cybersecurity incident ; and our use of third - party products , services and components . we are committed to maintaining robust governance and oversight of these risks and to implementing mechanisms , controls , technologies , and processes designed to help us assess , identify , and manage these risks . while we have not , as of the date of this form [XX] - k , experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations , there can be no guarantee that we will not experience such an incident in the future . such incidents , whether or not successful , could result in our incurring significant costs related to , for example , rebuilding our internal systems , writing down inventory value , implementing additional threat protection measures , providing modifications or replacements to our products and services , defending against litigation , responding to regulatory inquiries or actions , paying damages , providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us , or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties , as well as incurring significant reputational harm . in addition , these threats are constantly evolving , thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures . we have seen an increase in cyberattack volume , frequency , and sophistication . we seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network , products , and services , and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services ; however , we remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats . in some instances , we , our suppliers , our customers , and the users of our products and services can be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects . further , there is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents , including reporting to regulators , which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm . see "" risk factors "" for more information on our cybersecurity risks and product vulnerability risks . we aim to incorporate industry best practices throughout our cybersecurity program . our cybersecurity strategy focuses on implementing effective and efficient controls , technologies , and other processes to assess , identify , and manage material cybersecurity risks . our cybersecurity program is designed to be aligned with applicable industry standards and is assessed annually by independent third - party auditors . we have processes in place to assess , identify , manage , and address material cybersecurity threats and incidents . these include , among other things : annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees ; mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual network activity ; and containment and incident response tools . we actively engage with industry groups for benchmarking and awareness of best practices . we monitor issues that are internally discovered or externally reported that may affect our products , and have processes to assess those issues for potential cybersecurity impact or risk . we also have a process in place to manage cybersecurity risks associated with third - party service providers . we impose security requirements upon our suppliers , including : maintaining an effective security management program ; abiding by information handling and asset management requirements ; and notifying us in the event of any known or suspected cyber incident . our board of directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk , which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program . that program is utilized in making decisions with respect to company priorities , resource allocations , and oversight structures . the board of directors is assisted by the audit & finance committee , which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program with management and reports to the board of directors . cybersecurity reviews by the audit & finance committee or the board of directors generally occur at least twice annually , or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable . a number of intel directors have experience in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk . # # table_start risk factors and other key information # # table_end our cybersecurity program is run by our chief information security officer ( ciso ) , who reports to our executive vice president and chief technology officer ( cto ) . our ciso is informed about and monitors prevention , detection , mitigation , and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team , many of whom hold cybersecurity certifications such as a certified information systems security professional or certified information security manager , and through the use of technological tools and software and results from third party audits . our ciso and cto have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk . our ciso has served in that position since [XXXX] and , before intel , was previously the chief security officer at mcafee and the chief information officer and ciso for the us house of representatives . our cto joined intel in [XXXX] and was previously senior vice president and cto at vmware , with responsibility for product security . our ciso and cto regularly report directly to the audit & finance committee or the board of directors on our cybersecurity program and efforts to prevent , detect , mitigate , and remediate issues . in addition , we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the board of directors of material issues ."

"" competition our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets . important competitive factors include effectiveness , safety , and ease of use ; formulary placement , price , payer coverage and reimbursement rates , and demonstrated cost - effectiveness ; regulatory approvals ; marketing effectiveness ; and research and development of new products , processes , modalities , and uses . early market entry and rapid patient access can also be important to achieve product acceptance and success . most new products or uses that we introduce must compete with other branded , biosimilar , or generic products already on the market or that are later developed by competitors . when competitors introduce new products , uses , or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages , including by developing new modalities , our products become subject to decreased sales volumes , progressive price reductions , or both . we believe our long - term competitive success depends on discovering and developing ( either alone or in collaboration with others ) or acquiring innovative , cost - effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers , and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment . there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products , and it is possible that our products will be , or will become , uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or uses developed by our competitors . generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars can pose major competitive challenges to our business . in most major jurisdictions , the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals ( other than biological products ( biologics ) ) exempts generics from costly and time - consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy , allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product . as a result , generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products . accordingly , when a branded non - biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity , it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product , which can result in the loss of a significant portion of the branded product 's revenue in a very short period of time . moreover , governments in some countries leverage generic entrants to drive price concessions through the utilization of volume - based procurement bidding and other measures . further , public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to branded products . laws in the u.s . generally allow , and in many cases require , pharmacists to substitute generics that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a branded product . where substitution is mandatory , it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it . in certain countries , intellectual property protection is weak , and we must compete with generic versions of our products at or relatively shortly after launch . in addition , competition for our biologics , which constitute a substantial portion of our products and pipeline , may be affected by the approval of follow - on biologics , also known as biosimilars . a biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that , due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic , may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic . globally , most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow - ons to innovator biologics , including the biologics price competition and innovation act of [XXXX] ( the bpcia ) in the u.s . a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the bpcia , as well as in europe and japan . regulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve , and therefore the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty . for example , the extent to which a biosimilar , once approved , will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non - biologic products will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing . biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities . while competitors have developed biosimilars that compete with our products , we have developed our own biosimilar and may develop others in the future . u.s . private sector dynamics in the u.s . private sector , consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals . health plans , managed care organizations , pharmacy benefit managers , wholesalers , pharmacies , and other supply chain entities have been consolidating into fewer , larger entities , thus enhancing their market power and importance . private third - party insurers , as well as governments , typically maintain formularies that specify coverage ( the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan 's formulary ) and reimbursement ( the associated out - of - pocket cost to the consumer ) to control costs by negotiating discounts or rebates in exchange for formulary inclusion and placement . formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a product for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions , such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions , or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out - of - pocket cost , such as non - preferred co - pay tiers , increased co - insurance levels , and higher deductibles . consequently , pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in negotiations , and compete fiercely for formulary placement , not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy , safety profile , or patient ease of use , but also by providing rebates or other concessions . as payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and rebates , value - based agreements , where rebates may be based on achievement ( or not ) of specified outcomes , are another increasingly prevalent tool . rebates and net cost are increasingly important factors in formulary decisions , particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable . these pressures have negatively affected , and could continue to negatively affect , our consolidated results of operations . in addition to formulary placement , changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost - sharing through high deductible plans , higher co - insurance , or co - pays , including increased utilization of co - pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs . supply chain entities have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to favor the use of generic products or otherwise limit access to our products . for additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products , see "" — regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing , reimbursement , and access — u.s . "" patents , trademarks , and other intellectual property rights overview intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines and uses . loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals , especially for non - biologic products , typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product , often leading to a severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product . we own , have applied for , or are licensed under , a large number of patents in the u.s . and many other countries relating to products , product uses , formulations , and manufacturing processes . in addition , for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws . the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by patents claiming the active ingredient ( the compound patent ) for our products , particularly those in major markets such as the u.s . , major european countries , and japan . in general , patents in each relevant country last for a period of [XX] years from their filing date , which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product . further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term : • patent term adjustment is available to all u.s . patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the u.s . patent and trademark office ( uspto ) . • patent term restoration for a single patent for a pharmaceutical product is provided to u.s . patent holders to compensate for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the u.s . food and drug administration ( fda ) review process . there is a five - year cap on any restoration , and no patent 's expiration date may be extended beyond [XX] years from fda approval . some countries outside the u.s . similarly offer forms of patent term restoration . for example , supplementary protection certificates are available to extend the life of a european patent up to an additional five years ( subject to a [XX] - year cap from european medicines agency ( ema ) approval ) and in japan patent terms can be extended up to five years . in some cases , the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic , biosimilar , or other follow - on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics and challenges , later - expiring patents on manufacturing processes , methods of use or formulations , or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws . the primary forms of data protection are as follows : • data package protection generally prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company 's regulatory submission data for the drug . the base period is generally five years in the u.s . ( [XX] years for new biologics under the bpcia , subject to certain conditions ) , effectively [XX] years in europe , and eight years in japan . the period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patents . • in the u.s . , the fda has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period . if granted , this "" pediatric exclusivity "" provides an additional six months of exclusivity , which is added to the term of data protection , orphan drug exclusivity and , for products other than biologics , to the term of any relevant and non - expired patents . • a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive "" orphan "" designation in the u.s . if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than [XXX,XXX] people in the u.s . , or where it is not reasonably expected to recover development and marketing costs through u.s . sales . orphan designation entitles a particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity , which runs in parallel with any applicable patents . outside the major markets , the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals vary widely . international and u.s . free trade agreements like the agreement on trade - related aspects of intellectual property rights ( trips agreement ) administered by the world trade organization provide global protection of certain intellectual property rights . but in a number of markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products . further , many developing countries , and some developed countries , do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the trips agreement . our intellectual property portfolio we consider intellectual property protection for certain products , processes , uses , and formulations to be important to our business . in addition to the patents and data protection identified below , we may hold patents on manufacturing processes , formulations , devices , or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below . for approved products , dates include , where applicable , pending or granted patent term extensions . the most relevant patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our major or recently launched patent -

how . we seek to protect our confidential information in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees , corporate partners , collaborators , and vendors . these agreements may be breached , and we can not be certain that we have adequate remedies . if our trade secrets or confidential information become known or are independently discovered by competitors , or if we enter into disputes over ownership of inventions , our business and results of operations could be adversely affected . patent licenses and collaborations some of our products are subject to significant license and collaboration agreements . for information on our license and collaboration agreements , see item [X] , "" financial statements and supplementary data — note [X] : collaborations and other arrangements . "" patent challenges in the u.s . , the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of [XXXX] , commonly known as the hatch - waxman act , authorizes the fda to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals ( other than biologics ) when the generic manufacturer files an abbreviated new drug application ( anda ) . absent a patent challenge , the fda can not approve an anda until after certain of the innovator 's patents expire . however , after the innovator has marketed its product for four years , a generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that the patent(s ) listed in the innovator 's new drug application ( nda ) are invalid , unenforceable or not infringed . generic manufacturers use this process extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals . in addition , generic companies have shown willingness to launch "" at risk , "" i.e. , after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge . under the bpcia , the fda can not approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires , [XX] years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic , and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved . however , the bpcia does provide a mechanism for a prospective biosimilar competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator 's patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic . the patent litigation scheme under the bpcia , and the bpcia itself , is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda , as well as by courts . courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the bpcia patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration . in addition , there is a procedure in u.s . patent law , known as inter partes review ( ipr ) , which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued u.s . patent for validity . iprs are conducted before administrative patent judges in the uspto using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court and challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity . generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the ipr process in attempts to invalidate our patents . in addition , in december [XXXX] , the u.s . presidential administration released a proposed framework that would permit the federal government to consider the price of a drug developed using federal funds as a factor in determining whether it may exercise "" march - in rights "" and license it to a third party to manufacture . a comment period on the proposal runs through february [X] , [XXXX] , and we are not able to predict whether a final rule will be adopted in accordance with the proposed framework . outside the u.s . , the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely . in recent years , we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the u.s . for more information on patent challenges and litigation involving our intellectual property rights , see item 1a , "" risk factors — risks related to our business — our long - term success depends on intellectual property protection ; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated , circumvented , or weakened , our business will be adversely affected . "" and item [X] , "" financial statements and supplementary data — note [XX] : contingencies . "" government regulation of our operations our operations are regulated extensively by numerous government agencies . regulation of products the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing , data analysis , manufacturing development , and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation . in addition , our operations are subject to complex federal , state , local , and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers , pricing and reimbursement for our products , the environment , occupational health and safety , data privacy and security , and other matters . evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations and those of other healthcare intermediaries , including with respect to current good manufacturing practices ( cgmp ) , quality assurance , and similar regulations . regulatory oversight of the pharmaceutical industry entails judgment and interpretation , which can result in inconsistent administration of laws and regulations by health authorities . compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery , development , and introduction of new products and uses has and will continue to require substantial effort , expense , and capital investment . of particular importance to our business is regulation by the fda in the u.s . pursuant to laws and regulations that include the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( fdca ) , the fda has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the u.s . and administers requirements covering the testing , safety , effectiveness , manufacturing , quality control , distribution , labeling , marketing , promotion , advertising , dissemination of information , and post - marketing surveillance of those products and devices . the fda holds broad discretion under the fdca and other statutes to interpret the conditions and evidence necessary for timely approval of our drugs and devices . following approval , our products remain subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies in connection with labeling , import , export , sale , storage , recordkeeping , advertising , promotion , and safety reporting . we conduct extensive post - marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell and comply with notification requirements related to safety and efficacy , product supply , and other aspects of our products and operations . the fda may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market , including as may be identified through market surveillance or third - party studies involving our products . the fda may also mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product 's life cycle based on new safety information or as part of a labeling change to a particular class of products . in addition , the fda strictly regulates marketing , labeling , advertising , and promotion of products to prescribers and patients . pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label . the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off - label uses . outside the u.s . , our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements , notably by the ema in europe , the ministry of health , labor and welfare in japan , and the national medical products administration in china . specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country . regulatory and compliance requirements , as well as approval processes outside the u.s . , may differ from those in the u.s . and may involve additional costs , uncertainties , and risks . the fda and other regulatory agencies outside the u.s . extensively regulate all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under their cgmp regulations . regulators assess compliance with these regulations by inspecting the equipment , facilities , laboratories , and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of our products prior to marketing approval with periodic reinspection thereafter ; this may include inspection of our third - party business partners . we make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive , company - wide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing , product development , and process development operations in an effort to maintain sustained compliance with cgmp and other regulations . nonetheless , manufacturing quality and other aspects of pharmaceutical regulatory compliance is heavily scrutinized and results in government investigations , regulatory and legal actions , product recalls and seizures , fines and penalties , interruption of production leading to product shortages , import bans or denials of import certifications , delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of any issues , any of which have and could adversely affect our business and reputation . certain of our products , devices and components are manufactured by third parties , and their failure to comply with these regulations has and could in the future adversely affect us , including through failure to supply product to us or delays in approvals of new products or indications . for example , in [XXXX] we received complete response letters based on fda observations made during inspections of manufacturing facilities rather than any issues related to efficacy or safety . these resulted in certain delays in the approval of new products . any determination by the fda or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business and reputation . for more information on product regulation challenges , see item 1a , "" risk factors — risks related to our operations — reliance on third - party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business . "" emergency use authorizations the secretary of health and human services may issue an emergency use authorization ( eua ) to authorize unapproved medical products , or unapproved uses of approved medical products , to be manufactured , marketed , and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government . for example , certain of our products were previously made available for the treatment of covid-19 under respective euas . an eua terminates when the emergency determination underlying the eua terminates , and euas can be revoked under other circumstances , the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict . outside the u.s . , the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that vary and differ from those in the u.s . other laws and regulations the marketing , promotional , and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers , as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers , prescribers , and patients , are subject to various other u.s . federal and state laws , as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations , including the federal anti - kickback statute , the false claims act , antitrust laws , and state laws governing kickbacks , false claims , unfair trade practices , and consumer protection . these laws are administered by , among others , the department of justice , the office of inspector general of the u.s . department of health and human services ( hhs ) , the federal trade commission , the office of personnel management , and state attorneys general . state , federal , and foreign governments , agencies , and other regulatory bodies are active in their oversight , enforcement activities , and coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies , which has resulted in intensified scrutiny , litigation costs , corporate criminal sanctions , and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry . the u.s . foreign corrupt practices act of [XXXX] ( fcpa ) prohibits certain individuals and entities , including u.s . publicly traded companies , from promising , offering , or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage . the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on u.s . publicly traded companies . as noted above , our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with officials outside the u.s . additionally , in many countries outside the u.s . , healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities ; therefore , our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa . in addition to the u.s . application and enforcement of the fcpa , the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior . in recent years , several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area , increased their enforcement activities , and/or increased the level of cross - border coordination and information sharing . we are , and could in the future become , subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions , which could include claims for civil penalties ( including treble damages ) , criminal sanctions , and administrative remedies , including exclusion from u.s . federal and other healthcare programs . it is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations , liquidity , and financial position in any given period . we are also subject to a variety of federal , state , local , and foreign environmental , health and safety , and other laws and regulations that may affect our research , development , or production efforts . regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing , reimbursement , and access u.s . there continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing . in addition , u.s . government actions to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs , including medicare and medicaid , may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products . in august [XXXX] , the u.s . government enacted the inflation reduction act of [XXXX] ( ira ) . among other measures , the ira requires hhs to effectively set prices for certain single - source drugs and biologics reimbursed under medicare part b and part d. generally , these government prices apply nine years ( for medicines approved under an nda ) or thirteen years ( for medicines approved under a biologics license application ( bla ) ) following initial fda approval and will be set at a price that is likely to represent a significant discount from existing average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers . while the law specifies a ceiling price , it does not set a minimum or floor price . in august [XXXX] , hhs selected jardiance , which is part of our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim , as one of the first ten medicines subject to government - set prices effective in [XXXX] . given our product portfolio , we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years , which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to expiry of exclusivities . the effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations . other ira provisions require drug manufacturers to provide rebates for medicare part b and part d medicines under certain circumstances . also , the part d benefit redesign will replace the part d coverage gap discount program ( cgdp ) with a new manufacturer discount program . beginning in january [XXXX] , the [XX] percent cgdp discount will be replaced by a [XX] percent manufacturer discount for all medicare part d beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of pocket drug costs below a $ [X,XXX] threshold and a [XX] percent discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $ [X,XXX] threshold under the part d benefit redesign . manufacturers that fail to comply with the ira may be subject to various penalties , including civil monetary penalties , which could be significant . the ira has and will meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors . in particular , the nine - year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under an nda reduces the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation . the ira can cause changes to development approach , and timing and investments at - risk . the full impact of the ira on our business and the pharmaceutical industry , including the implications to us of a competitor 's product being selected for price setting , remains uncertain . heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products and the practices of pharmacy benefit managers and other supply chain entities has also resulted in several u.s . congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to , among other things , bring more transparency to product pricing , review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs , require advance notice of list price increases , establish upper payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards , allow the importation of drugs from other countries , address pharmacy benefit manager practices , and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products . restrictive or unfavorable pricing , coverage , or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments , regulatory agencies , courts , or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results . additional policies , regulations , legislation , or enforcement , including those proposed or pursued by the u.s . congress , the u.s . executive branch and regulatory authorities worldwide , could intensify these efforts and adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations . in the u.s . , we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs , including state medicaid and medicaid managed care programs ( a minimum of [XX.X] percent plus adjustments for price increases above the consumer price index over time ) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of healthcare facilities intended to serve low - income and uninsured patients ( known as 340b covered entities ) . additionally , an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs . changes to the 340b program or the medicaid programs could have a material adverse impact on our business . for example , continued expansion of the 340b program and growth of entities claiming entitlement to 340b pricing , including in ways that may be inconsistent with the statutory scheme , impacts our revenue on an increasing percentage of sales . changes to the calculation of rebates under the medicaid program could also increase our medicaid rebate obligations and decrease the prices charged to 340b covered entities . we have implemented a contract pharmacy limited distribution system applicable to sales through the 340b program , which generally limits distribution of 340b - priced product to : ( i ) covered entities and their child sites ; ( ii ) contract pharmacies wholly owned by the covered entity ; or ( iii ) if a covered entity lacks an in - house outpatient pharmacy , a single contract pharmacy designated by a covered entity to establish a 340b bill to / ship to arrangement . our contract pharmacy limited distribution system contains certain exceptions that permit broader contract pharmacy usage , including for "" penny priced "" insulin products , provided that the covered entity passes through all discounts to eligible patients at the point of sale and meets other conditions . we believe our contract pharmacy limited distribution system complies with the 340b statute , but it remains subject to ongoing inquiries and litigation that could have a material impact on our business , as discussed in item [X] , "" financial statements and supplementary data — note [XX] : contingencies . "" other aspects of the 340b program , including the proper definitions of "" patient "" and "" child site "" under the 340b statute , are also subject to ongoing litigation by other parties , the resolution of which could impact the growth and scope of the 340b program . rebates are also negotiated in the private sector . we pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers . these rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class . our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by medicare may be impacted by the [XXXX] regulatory amendments to the anti - kickback statute 's discount safe harbor , which have been stayed until at least january [X] , [XXXX] . for a discussion of risks related to how we price our products , see item 1a , "" risk factors — risks related to our business — we face litigation and investigations related to our products , how we price or commercialize our products , and other aspects of our business , which could adversely affect our business , and we are self - insured for such matters . "" outside the u.s . globally , public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value , including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes . in addition , third - party organizations , including professional associations , academic institutions , and non - profit entities associated with payers , conduct and publish comparative effectiveness and cost / benefit analyses on medicines , the impact of which can influence pharmaceutical access and pricing . in most international markets , we operate in an environment of government - mandated cost - containment programs , which may include price controls , international reference pricing ( to other countries ' prices ) , discounts and rebates , therapeutic reference pricing ( to other , often generic , pharmaceutical choices ) , regulatory hurdles , restrictions on physician prescription levels , and mandatory generic substitution . in these markets , healthcare services and the determination of pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products are impacted by government control at the point of care or as the primary payer . the european commission published its draft general pharmaceutical legislation in april [XXXX] . while certain elements in the european commission draft could expedite regulatory timelines , we anticipate that the overall market and patient impact would be negative if the legislation is approved as drafted . implementation timing is unknown at this time . health care cost containment remains a focus in the eu , among other jurisdictions . most countries in the eu attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in some form of reference pricing in which authorities examine pre - determined internal or external markets for published prices of a product or national class of drugs . member states also have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and may condition access on agreement of a reimbursement price or completion of cost - effectiveness or other gating studies . in japan , our products generally are subject to government - mandated annual price reductions . the government may also order re - pricings for specific products or classes of products if certain criteria are met , including exceeding product use thresholds . china has introduced and implemented reforms to accelerate access to innovative products and reduce costs . to drive patient access , we seek inclusion of many of our branded products on china 's national reimbursement drug list , a list of drugs fully or partially reimbursed by china ’s national basic health insurance . in exchange for broad access , these products are generally subject to negotiation of significant price concessions . china also utilizes a value - based procurement program process for products that have generic substitutes . products that we choose to tender through this process are similarly subject to price reductions . our performance in china may be significantly impacted by the country 's evolving pharmaceutical regulatory environment , including access , intellectual property protection , regulatory enforcement and compliance , and trade policies . governments in many emerging markets are also focused on limiting health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property . reforms in our product markets , including those that may stem from periods of uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty , or as a result of high inflation , emergence , or escalation of , and responses to , international tension and conflicts , or government budgeting priorities , may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products . we can not predict the extent to which our business may be affected by current or potential future legislative , regulatory , or payer developments . however , in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing , resulting in additional state , federal , and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products as well as overall operations . see item [X] , "" management 's discussion and analysis — executive overview — other matters — trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing , reimbursement , and access "" for additional information regarding recent legislative , administrative , and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results . research and development our commitment to research and development dates back more than [XXX] years . we invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long - term competitiveness . at the end of [XXXX] , we employed approximately [XX,XXX] people in pharmaceutical research and development activities , including a substantial number of physicians , scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees , and highly skilled technical personnel . our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of metabolism ( including diabetes , obesity and cardiovascular ) , immunology , neuroscience , and oncology . in addition to discovering and developing new medicines , we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses , formulations , and therapeutic approaches , including complementary delivery devices or diagnostic tools , that can provide additional value to patients . to supplement our internal efforts , we collaborate with others , including academic institutions and research - based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies . we use the services of physicians , hospitals , medical schools , and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines . we also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts . these investments can take many forms , including , among others , licensing arrangements , co - development agreements , co - promotion arrangements , joint ventures , acquisitions , and equity investments . pharmaceutical development is time - consuming , expensive , and risky . very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines . the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade . candidates can fail at any stage of the process , and even late - stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success . in addition , novel modalities can present more challenging or lengthy development timelines . the following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products : phases of new drug development • discovery phase in the discovery phase , scientists identify , design , and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease . targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development , which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans . the discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low . • early development phase early development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements . safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals , as necessary . in general , the first human tests ( often referred to as phase i ) are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range . subsequently , larger populations of patients are studied ( phase ii ) to identify signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety . in parallel , scientists work to identify safe , effective , and economical manufacturing processes . long - term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues . of the candidates that enter the early development phase , approximately [XX] percent move to the late development phase . the early development phase varies but can take several years to complete . • late development phase late phase development projects ( typically phase iii ) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies . as a result , these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease . these studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies , placebo , or both . phase iii studies are generally conducted globally , are costly , and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval . the duration of phase iii testing varies by disease and may take years . • submission phase once a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies , the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years , depending on the disease state , the strength and complexity of available data , the degree of unmet need , and the time required for the regulatory agency(ies ) to evaluate the submission , which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors . there is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval , or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas . see item [X] , "" management 's discussion and analysis — executive overview — late - stage pipeline , "" for more information on our late - stage product candidates . raw materials and product supply most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source . however , certain raw or intermediate materials are procured from a single source . we seek to maintain sufficient inventory to provide reliability of production and manage unforeseen supply variability . however , various developments have led , and may in the future lead , to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources , implement alternative processes , bring new manufacturing facilities online , or pause or discontinue product sales in one or more markets . the majority of our revenue comes from products produced predominantly in our own facilities . our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the u.s . , including puerto rico , and ireland . finishing operations , including formulation , filling , assembling , delivery device manufacturing , and packaging , take place at a number of sites throughout the world . to support anticipated demand for our current and prospective products , we have undertaken significant manufacturing expansion initiatives . during [XXXX] , commercial production commenced at our research triangle park manufacturing site in durham , north carolina . further investments to increase our manufacturing capacity include planned sites in concord , north carolina , limerick , ireland , alzey , rhineland - palatinate , germany , and two in lebanon , indiana . we also utilize and are expanding arrangements with third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing , filling , finishing operations , and for device or component production and assembly . we manage our supply chain ( including our own facilities , contracted arrangements , and inventory ) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand . to maintain supply of our products , we use a variety of techniques , including comprehensive quality systems , inventory management , and back - up sites . however , pharmaceutical production processes are complex , highly regulated , and vary widely from product to product . shifting or adding manufacturing capacity is a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures , process modifications , and regulatory approvals . accordingly , developments such as unanticipated demand , unplanned plant shutdowns , manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or contracted facilities , failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities , increases in demand on a supplier , or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors have led , and may in the future lead , to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain products , product shortages , or pauses or discontinuations of product sales in one or more markets . for example , we have experienced challenges in meeting strong demand for our incretin products in recent periods , partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies , and expect tight supply to persist while additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized . further , cost and wage inflation , availability of adequate capacity in global transportation , supply chain complexities , including consolidation therein , labor market issues , international tension and conflicts , uneven economic growth or downturns , an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials , and public health outbreaks , epidemics , or pandemics , such as the covid-19 pandemic , have caused , and in the future may cause , delays or disruptions in and/or increased costs related to distribution of our medicines , the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity , procurement activity , and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements , as well as other general business impacts . for more information on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties , disruptions , and shortages in the manufacturing , distribution , and sale of our products , see item 1a , "" risk factors — risks related to our business — manufacturing , quality , or supply chain difficulties , disruptions , or shortages could lead to product supply problems .

party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data , the application of pricing controls , limited scope of approved uses , label changes , changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of newer , better , or more cost - effective competitive products , difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture , insufficient infrastructure to support detection , diagnostic or other requisites for treatment , ineffectiveness in reaching healthcare professionals , including digitally given the increase in virtual engagements , or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others . we may also fail to allocate research and development resources efficiently , fail to pursue or invest sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may have been successful , or fail to optimally balance trial design , conduct , and speed to accomplish desired outcomes . regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications . delay , uncertainty , unpredictability , and inconsistency in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches , lost market opportunities , impairment of inventories , and other negative impacts . in addition , it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of , or variability in demand for , new products and indications , which in some cases leads to difficulty meeting product demand or , on the other hand , excess inventory and related financial charges . we can not state with certainty when or whether our products and indications now under development will be approved or launched ; whether , if initially granted , such approval will be maintained ; whether we will be able to develop , license , or otherwise acquire additional product candidates , indications or products ; or whether our products and indications , once launched , will be commercially successful . through internal innovation and business development we must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and indications or line extensions sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and investments and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls , lose intellectual property exclusivity , or are displaced by competing products or therapies . failure to timely replenish our product portfolio and pipeline would have a material adverse effect on our business , results of operations , cash flows , and financial position . our dependence on , or focus in , one or more key products or product classes may exacerbate this risk . in addition , the growth of our business and revenue base increases the risk that products developed or acquired by us may not provide adequate value to sustain further long - term growth . we engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance or refine our product pipeline , including licensing arrangements , co - development agreements , co - promotion arrangements , distribution and promotion agreements , joint ventures , acquisitions , equity investments , and divestitures . there are substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions . increased focus on business combinations in our industry , including by the federal trade commission and competition authorities in europe and other jurisdictions , and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay , jeopardize , or increase the costs of our business development activities . in addition , failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses , products , or assets we acquire ( including related technology , commercial operations , compliance programs , information security , manufacturing , distribution , and general business operations and procedures ) may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges . we also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to limited diligence opportunities , unsuccessful clinical trials , issues related to the quality , integrity , or broad applicability of data , regulatory impediments , and manufacturing or commercialization challenges . additionally , business development activity focused on new modalities may entail additional risks and costs . accordingly , business development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner ( if at all ) , may not result in successful development outcomes or successful commercialization of any product , may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny , and may result in charges that negatively impact our financial position or results of operations in any given period . see item [X] , "" business — research and development — phases of new drug development "" and item [X] , "" management 's discussion and analysis — executive overview — late - stage pipeline , "" for more details about our current product pipeline . • we and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies , biotechnology companies , and lower - cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers , and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business . we compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies , biotechnology companies , and generic pharmaceutical companies and , in many cases , our products compete against the leading products of one or more of our competitors . to compete successfully , we must continue to deliver to the market innovative , cost - effective products through internal innovation or business development that meet important medical needs , provide improved outcomes for patients , and deliver value to payers . our product revenues and prospects are adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are first to market , have better marketplace access , have greater brand recognition or are perceived as superior by the marketplace , by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products , and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products . our revenues are also adversely affected by treatment innovations , including new or superior modalities , that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs . regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts . particularly for biosimilars , health authority guidelines and legislative actions could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars . given the importance to us of marketed biologic products and those in our clinical - stage pipeline , such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business . see item [X] , "" business — competition "" and "" business — research and development , "" for more details . alternatively , actual or perceived failure of robust generic and biosimilar competition could propel governments to adopt additional policies and legislation that threaten our intellectual property , pricing of our products , or other aspects of our business . in addition , we rely on our ability to attract , engage , and retain highly qualified and skilled scientific , technical , management , and other personnel in order to compete effectively . to continue to commercialize our products , and advance the research , development , and commercialization of additional modalities , indications , and product candidates , we have expanded , and will likely need to further expand , our workforce , including in the areas of manufacturing , clinical trials management , regulatory affairs , and sales and marketing , both in and outside the u.s . we continue to face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies , biotechnology companies , academic and other research institutions , as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities , which has and may continue to increase our labor costs . our ability to attract and retain talent in our increasingly competitive environment is further complicated by evolving employment trends . our failure to compete effectively for talent could negatively affect sales of our current and any future approved products and indications , and could result in material financial , legal , commercial , or reputational harm to our business . • our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing , reimbursement , and access for our drugs , which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations , reputation or business . public and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for , and patient access to , our medicines . these pressures have negatively affected , and could continue to negatively affect , our consolidated results of operations . governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of , and actions intended to address , pricing , reimbursement , and access to pharmaceutical products and are demanding greater commercial and clinical value from pharmaceutical companies in the form of strong product differentiation and demonstrated value . we have experienced increased scrutiny on the pricing of current and potential diabetes , obesity , and alzheimer 's products due to payer concern over projected growth in these markets and , for certain of these drugs , the anticipated duration of treatment . we have also observed scrutiny of pricing and access disparities across jurisdictions . additional policies , regulations , legislation , or enforcement , including because of the regulatory priorities of the u.s . presidential administration and regulatory authorities worldwide , could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations . for example , in august [XXXX] , hhs selected jardiance , which is part of our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim , as one of the first ten medicines subject to government - set prices effective in [XXXX] . given our product portfolio , we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years , which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to exclusivity expiry . the effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations . within the u.s . , state level transparency initiatives , importation rules , reporting requirements , and mandated programs , including the establishment of drug affordability boards with the power to set upper payment limits on certain drugs in state - regulated plans , have also increased administrative costs , in some cases , compromised confidential business practices and otherwise detrimentally impacted our business . certain states have also undertaken efforts to codify 340b contract pharmacies into statute which would increase the cost of 340b programs . for more details , see item [X] , "" business — regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing , reimbursement , and access . "" further , restrictive or unfavorable pricing , coverage , or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments , regulatory agencies , courts , or private payers , including in relation to the implementation of the ira , reference pricing , and compulsory licensing , may adversely impact our business and financial results . we continue to experience additional pricing pressures , rebates , clawbacks , and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting from the financial strain of the covid-19 pandemic , periods of uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty , and the emergence or escalation of , and responses to , international tension and conflicts . in addition , government price reporting and payment regulations are complex , and require ongoing assessment of the methods by which we calculate and report pricing . calculation methodologies are inherently subjective and are subject to review and challenge by government agencies . if agencies disagree with our calculations , or the methodologies and assumptions underlying them , we may need to restate previously reported data and could be subject to financial and legal liability , which may be significant . in addition , changes to calculation methodologies could adversely affect our financial position or consolidated results of operations in any given period . for more details , see item [X] , "" business — regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing , reimbursement , and access , "" item [X] , "" management 's discussion and analysis — executive overview — other matters — trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing , reimbursement , and access , "" and item [X] , "" financial statements and supplementary data — note [XX] : contingencies . "" • pharmaceutical products can develop safety or efficacy concerns , which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues , income , and reputation . pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of fixed duration and defined populations . after approval and launch , the products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients , which may lead to identifying new safety or efficacy concerns . we and others ( including regulatory agencies and private payers ) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in the marketplace . in addition , we or others ( including our competitors , in some cases ) may conduct post - marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products . new safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and post - marketing clinical studies of our products or those of our competitors may result in product label changes , or other measures that could reduce the product 's market acceptance and result in declining sales . relatedly , safety or efficacy concerns raised about a product in the same class or with the same mechanism of action as one of our products or product candidates could be imputed and have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our products or approval of product candidates . serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval have , and could in the future , result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market . safety issues have , and could in the future , result in costly product liability claims . any of these outcomes could result in material financial , legal , commercial , or reputational harm to our business . • we derive a significant percentage of our total revenue from relatively few products and sell our products through increasingly consolidated supply chain entities , which may subject us to , or exacerbate , various risks . we derived direct product and/or alliance revenues of more than $ [X] billion for each of trulicity , mounjaro , verzenio , taltz and jardiance ( including glyxambi , synjardy , and trijardy xr ) that collectively accounted for [XX] percent of our total revenues in [XXXX] . in particular , trulicity and mounjaro accounted for [XX] percent of our total revenues in [XXXX] and we expect products with glp-1 receptor agonist activity , including the recently launched zepbound , to represent a significant and growing portion of our business , revenues , and prospects . loss of patent protection , changes in prescription rates , material product liability or pricing litigation , unexpected side effects or safety concerns , significant changes in demand , regulatory proceedings and investigations , negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence , pressure from existing or new competitive products , counterfeit and illegally compounded drugs , changes in labeling , pricing , and insufficient access , or supply shortages or disruptions for these products or any of our other major products could materially impact our results of operations . in addition , in the u.s . , most of our products are distributed through wholesalers and if one of these significant wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties , it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us or we might be unable to timely collect the amounts that the wholesaler owes us , which could negatively impact our results of operations . see item [X] , "" business — marketing and distribution , "" for more details . challenges to u.s . retail pharmacies due to pharmacy benefit manager reimbursement pressures , among other things , have resulted in financial difficulties for some pharmacies that may impact patient experiences , lead to determinations by certain pharmacies to not carry one or more of our significant products or threaten the viability of these pharmacies , which could negatively impact our business and results of operations . moreover , the negotiating power of health plans , managed care organizations , pharmacy benefit managers , and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation , regulatory , and other market impacts , and they , along with governments , increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs , including through the use of formulary inclusion , or favorable formulary placement . such stakeholders have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to favor the use of generic products or otherwise limit access to our products . as these practices expand , including due to potential further consolidation of u.s . private third - party payers , we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products . we expect that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers . pharmacy benefit manager practices have come under increased scrutiny from u.s . policymakers at the federal and state level who have proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact that these intermediaries have on drug pricing and patients ’ out of pocket costs . if promulgated , such legislation could have resultant implications , costs , or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities . for additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products , see item [X] , "" business — u.s . private sector dynamics "" and "" regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing , reimbursement , and access — u.s . "" risks related to our intellectual property • we depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues , cash flows , and earnings ; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted , and in the future is likely to continue to result , in rapid and severe declines in revenues for those products . in the ordinary course of their lifecycles , our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the u.s . , as well as in key jurisdictions outside the u.s . , after a specified period of time . some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third - party challenges . we have faced , and remain exposed to , generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection . for non - biologic products , loss of exclusivity ( whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation ) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors , leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues , especially in the u.s . generic pharmaceutical companies have in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation . for biologics , loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near - term entry of competitor versions ( i.e. , biosimilars ) due to many factors , including development timelines , manufacturing challenges , and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approval pathways . there is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged . moreover , patents relating to particular products , uses , formulations , or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products . patents held by third - parties have also contributed , and may in the future contribute , to a decision by us to not pursue all potential indications for a product candidate . in addition , competitors or other third parties may assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them , or allege a third - party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property . see item [X] , "" management 's discussion and analysis — executive overview — other matters — patent matters , "" and item [X] , "" business — patents , trademarks , and other intellectual property rights , "" for more details . patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process . given the limited duration of patent and data protection , the speed with which we develop products , complete clinical testing , receive regulatory approval , supply commercial product to the market , and obtain public and private payer access are important factors in recouping our development costs and generating financial returns , particularly given regulatory and market dynamics that have and may continue to put pressure on pricing , exclusivity periods , and competition . delays in achieving these milestones in some cases limits our ability to capitalize on the innovative medicines that we develop or acquire . • our long - term success depends on intellectual property protection ; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated , circumvented , or weakened , our business will be adversely affected . our long - term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire , develop , and commercialize innovative medicines . without strong intellectual property protection , we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development , as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs and indications to the market . intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time , depending on local laws and regulations . changes to such laws , regulations , and enforcement practices could reduce protections for our innovative products and indications . for example , a proposal by the european commission to revise the eu 's general pharmaceutical legislation threatens the predictability and length of certain pharmaceutical intellectual property incentives , including by a two - year reduction of data package protection . changes proposed by the uspto and by certain bills in congress to limit the number of , and differences between , patents obtained could also affect the scope of patent protection for our products in the u.s . in addition , in december [XXXX] , the u.s . presidential administration released a proposed framework that would permit the federal government to consider the price of a drug developed using federal funds as a factor in determining whether it may exercise "" march - in rights "" and license it to a third party to manufacture . a comment period on the proposal runs through february [X] , [XXXX] , and we are not able to predict whether a final rule will be adopted in accordance with the proposed framework . also in the u.s . , in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the bpcia , which applies to biologic products , the hatch - waxman act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering small molecule pharmaceutical products . as a result , we expect that our u.s . patents on major pharmaceutical products , including biologics , will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld . in addition , a separate ipr process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the uspto without the protections of the bpcia or hatch - waxman act . the use of ipr proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the bpcia or hatch - waxman act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use ipr proceedings as an alternative to hatch - waxman act or bpcia litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain . the uspto issued an interim procedure regarding the use of discretionary denials of ipr proceedings when there is parallel district court litigation . however , it is not clear how this interim procedure could affect the ability of our competitors to institute ipr proceedings after institution of litigation . if our patents are challenged through this expedited review process , even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent , our win provides limited precedential value at the ptab and no precedential value in federal district court , meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors . we face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the u.s . as well . the entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues . in addition , competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them . if successful , such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales . in addition , intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the u.s . is weak and we face heightened risks to our intellectual property rights in these jurisdictions , including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products at or relatively shortly after launch . see item [X] , "" business — patents , trademarks , and other intellectual property rights , "" and item [X] , "" financial statements and supplementary data — note [XX] : contingencies , "" for more details . we also face challenges from the distribution of counterfeit and illegally compounded versions of our genuine drugs , including as related to our products with glp-1 receptor agonist activity . counterfeits , and in some cases illegally compounded drugs , fraudulently claim to be , or claim to contain , genuine branded medicines . counterfeit and illegally compounded drugs may not have the same safety , quality , and effectiveness as approved drugs , and may pose serious health risks to patients . our reputation and business could suffer harm from counterfeit or illegally compounded drugs and our actions to stop or prevent illegal sales of such drugs may be costly or ineffective . risks related to our operations • failure , inadequacy , breach of , or unauthorized access to , our it systems or those of our third - party service providers , unauthorized access to our confidential information , or violations of data protection laws , could each result in material harm to our business and reputation . important confidential information owned by us , our business partners , or other third parties is stored in our information systems , networks , and facilities or those of third parties . this includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property , clinical trial information , corporate strategic plans , marketing plans , customer information , and personally identifiable information , such as employee and patient information ( collectively , confidential information ) . we also rely , to a large extent , on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems , infrastructure , cloud technologies , and hardware ( together , it systems ) , some of which are within our control and some of which are within the control of third parties , to accumulate , process , store , and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data . we are subject to a variety of evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy , data protection , and data security . maintaining the security , confidentiality , integrity , and availability of our it systems and confidential information is vital to our business . our failure , or the failure of our third - party service providers , to protect and maintain the security , confidentiality , integrity , and availability of our ( or their ) it systems and confidential information and other data could significantly harm our reputation as well as result in significant costs , including those related to fines , penalties , litigation , and obligations to comply with applicable data breach laws . it systems are inherently vulnerable to system inadequacies , inadequate controls or procedures , operating failures , unauthorized access , service interruptions or failures , security breaches , malicious intrusions , theft , exfiltration , ransomware , or cyber - attacks from a variety of sources , which may remain undetected for significant periods of time . from time to time , we update , transition , acquire , or expand use of our and third - party it systems , which may result in heightened vulnerability . some third - party it systems that are necessary for the operation of our business processes are maintained outside of our control but would impact business operations if compromised as a result of a cyber - attack . in february [XXXX] , we completed the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning ( erp ) system , which replaced our operating and financial systems , and we recently began our post - implementation activities . we can not assure that the erp system and our post - implementation activities will be free of significant operating failures , service interruptions , or creation of additional vulnerabilities . see item 9a , "" controls and procedures "" for more details . vulnerabilities , inadequacies , or failures are in many cases more acute for it systems associated with recently acquired businesses , and we may be unable to entirely address such vulnerabilities , inadequacies , or failures immediately after acquiring a business or ever . as a result , our newly acquired businesses are in some cases more vulnerable to failures , interruptions , breaches , intrusions , theft , exfiltration , or attacks . cyber - attacks are growing in their frequency , sophistication , and intensity , and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect , mitigate , or prevent . cyber - attacks come in many forms , including the deployment of harmful malware , exploitation of vulnerabilities ( including those of third - party software or systems ) , denial - of - service attacks , the use of social engineering , and other means to compromise the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of it systems , confidential information , and other data . breaches resulting in the compromise , disruption , degradation , manipulation , loss , theft , exfiltration , destruction , or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information , or the unauthorized access to , disruption of , interference with , or attack of , our it systems , products and services , can occur in a variety of ways , including negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information , or wrongful conduct by hackers , competitors , governments , nation - states , state - sponsored or affiliated groups , current or former company personnel , and other actors . our third - party partners , including third - party providers of data hosting or cloud services , as well as suppliers , distributors , alliances , and other third parties with whom we may share data , face similar risks , which could affect us directly or indirectly . unassociated third parties present further risks , including by propagating misinformation related to our products , business , and industry , including through social media . we and others in the healthcare industry have been and continue to be targets for cyber - attacks , and the number of threats has increased over time . numerous federal agencies that monitor and regulate internet and cyber - crime have issued guidance , alerts and directives warning of software vulnerabilities that require immediate patching , malicious actors targeting healthcare - related systems and nation - state sponsored hacking designed to steal valuable information . the failure , inadequacy , or breach of our it systems or business processes , the compromise , disruption , degradation , manipulation , loss , theft , exfiltration , destruction , or unauthorized access to , disclosure or use of , confidential information , or the unauthorized access to , disruption of , or interference with our products and services that rely on it systems or business processes , could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights ; result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure , or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on it systems or business processes ; damage our operations , patient and other relationships , or reputation ; undermine integration activities or otherwise delay or prevent the launch of acquired products ; result in unfavorable clinical trial results by virtue of incorrect or unreliable data ; expose us to ransom payment , other demands , or paralyze our operations ; give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws ; require disclosure to government authorities and/or regulators ; expose us to civil and criminal investigations ; and/or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages , which effects could endure for a long period of time . unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could further expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world , subject us to litigation , and damage public trust in our company . in addition , it system security in jurisdictions outside the u.s . is weaker and may result in additional costs , uncertainties , and risks . we are subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection , including laws and regulations relating to the collection , storage , handling , use , disclosure , transfer , and security of personal information . the legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and the subject of significant attention by regulators and private parties globally . regulators are imposing new data privacy and security requirements , including new and greater monetary fines or penalties for privacy violations , and jurisdictions where we operate have passed , or continue to propose , data privacy legislation and/or regulations . for example , we are subject to existing laws in the eu , united kingdom , china , and u.s . , all of which provide for substantial penalties for noncompliance . other jurisdictions where we operate have passed , or continue to propose , similar legislation and regulations . failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations . to date , system inadequacies , inadequate controls or procedures , operating failures , unauthorized access , service interruptions or failures , security breaches , malicious intrusions , theft , exfiltration , ransomware , cyber - attacks , and the compromise , disruption , degradation , manipulation , loss , theft , exfiltration , destruction , or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information , or the unauthorized access to , disruption of , interference with , or attack of , our it systems , products and services have not had a material impact on our business strategy , results of operations or financial condition . we maintain cyber liability insurance ; however , this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial , operational , legal , business , or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our it systems . we continue to implement measures in an effort to protect , detect , respond to , and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our it systems ; however , these measures may not be successful , and we may fail to detect or remediate system inadequacies , inadequate controls or procedures , operating failures , unauthorized access , service interruptions or failures , security breaches , malicious intrusions , theft , exfiltration , ransomware , cyber - attacks , or other compromises of our systems . any of these events could result in material financial , operational , legal , business , or reputational harm to our business . for a discussion of our management of cybersecurity risks , see item 1c , "" cybersecurity — risk management and strategy "" and "" — governance . "" • manufacturing , quality , or supply chain difficulties , disruptions , or shortages could lead to product supply problems . we are in the midst of a significant expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and substantial investment in long - term supply agreements to support current and anticipated demand for our products . pharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated . manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at our facilities or those of our contractors and suppliers , the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities , or increases in demand on a supplier with constrained capacity could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing , distribution , and sale of our products and/or product shortages , leading to lost revenue or reduced marked opportunities . in select cases , supply constraints may also lead to pauses , discontinuations , or other product availability issues in one or more markets , which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations , cash flows , and reputation . further , cost inflation and global transportation and logistics challenges , as well as tight labor markets , have caused , and in the future may cause , delays in , and/or increase costs related to , distribution of our medicines , the construction or other acquisition of additional manufacturing capacity , procurement activity , and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements . these disruptions and challenges could result from actual or perceived quality , oversight , or regulatory compliance problems ; natural disasters ( including increased instances or severity of natural disasters or other events that may be due to climate change ) , public health outbreaks , epidemics , or pandemics ; periods of uneven economic growth or downturns ; emergence or escalation of , and responses to international tension and conflicts ; equipment , mechanical , data , or it system vulnerabilities , such as system inadequacies , inadequate controls or procedures , operating failures , unauthorized access , service interruptions or failures , security breaches , malicious intrusions , theft , exfiltration , ransomware or other cyber - attacks from a variety of sources ; labor shortages ; challenges and complexities in manufacturing new drug modalities ; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers ; vertical integration by competitors within our supply chain ; or inability to obtain single - source or other raw or intermediate materials . regional or single source dependencies may in some cases accentuate risks related to manufacturing and supply . for example , we , and the pharmaceutical industry generally , depend on china - based partners for integral chemical synthesis , reagents , starting materials , and ingredients . finding alternative suppliers if and as necessary due to geopolitical developments or otherwise may not be feasible or could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of our products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals which would cause disruptions to patients and detrimentally impact our business . difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity have resulted , and in the future may result , in difficulty meeting demand , or disruptions , shortages , and higher costs in the supply of , our products . for example , we have experienced challenges in meeting demand for our incretin products in recent periods , partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies , and expect tight supply to persist while additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized . despite our ongoing efforts to meet significant expected demand by obtaining additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity , there can be no assurances that such capacity increases will be realized as expected . delays or challenges in operationalizing additional manufacturing capacity would limit our ability to capitalize on demand for our products . conversely , unexpected events that limit demand for our products would undermine our ability to realize the full benefit of significant capital expenditures that we have incurred , and expect to continue to incur , to augment manufacturing capacity and may also subject us to contractual payment obligations , which may be significant . the foregoing risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and reputation . see item [X] , "" business — raw materials and product supply , "" and item [X] , "" management 's discussion and analysis — financial condition and liquidity "" for more details . • reliance on third - party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business . we rely on third parties , including suppliers , distributors , alliances , and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies , and third - party service providers , for selected aspects of product and clinical development , manufacturing , commercialization , hosting of , and support for , it systems , product distribution , and certain financial transactional processes . as examples , we outsource the day - to - day management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations , certain active ingredient manufacturing , finishing operations , and device or component production and assembly to contract manufacturing organizations , and the distribution of our products through logistics providers . in some cases , product or indication approvals depend on the outcome of regulatory inspections of third parties on which we rely . for example , in september [XXXX] , the fda issued a complete response letter for our lebrikizumab bla for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis . in the letter , the fda cited findings that arose during a multi - sponsor inspection of a third - party , contract manufacturing organization that included the monoclonal antibody drug substance for lebrikizumab . we may encounter similar difficulties in the future , which could delay or prevent product launches and otherwise negatively affect our business , results , and reputation . outsourcing involves many risks , including the risk that third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements , including applicable requirements for diversity in clinical trials ; may not produce reliable results ; may not perform in a timely manner ; may not maintain the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of confidential and proprietary information relating to us , our clinical trial subjects , or patients ; may experience disruption or fail to perform due to it system vulnerabilities , such as inadequacies , inadequate controls or procedures , operating failures , unauthorized access , service interruptions or failures , security breaches , malicious intrusions , theft , exfiltration , ransomware or other cyber - attacks ; may be unable to satisfy their commitments to us in which case we may not be able to achieve acceptable alternative sourcing ; or may fail to perform at all . the foregoing risks may be heightened in jurisdictions outside the u.s . , where we may have fewer alternative providers as well as face additional costs , uncertainties , and risks . failure of third parties to meet their contractual , regulatory , confidentiality , privacy , security , or other obligations to us , our clinical trial subjects , and our patients could have a material adverse effect on our business . • our use of artificial intelligence ( ai ) or other emerging technologies could adversely impact our business and financial results . we have begun to deploy ai and other emerging technologies in various facets of our operations and we continue to explore further use cases for ai . the rapid advancement of these technologies presents opportunities for us in research , manufacturing , commercialization , and other business endeavors but also entails risks , including that ai - generated content , analyses , or recommendations we utilize could be deficient , that our competitors may more quickly or effectively adopt ai capabilities , or that our use of ai or other emerging technologies exacerbates regulatory , cybersecurity and other significant risks . effective development , management , and use of ai technologies is novel and complex , and there are technical challenges associated with achieving desired levels of accuracy , efficiency , and reliability . the algorithms and models utilized in ai systems may have limitations , including biases , errors , or inability to handle certain data types or scenarios or to render explainable outputs . furthermore , there are risks associated with the fact that the platforms providing ai models are in many cases owned and operated by emerging companies with less contractual and compliance sophistication . these factors may undermine our ability to effectively utilize ai or create competitive disadvantages should our competitors more skillfully make use of ai capabilities . further , if we are unable to effectively manage the use of ai technologies by our employees , our confidential information , intellectual property , or reputation could be put at risk . the emergence of ai and other technologies , particularly generative ai , may exacerbate other risks , including those related to regulation , litigation , compliance issues , ethical concerns , confidentiality , and data privacy or security . for example , regulatory uncertainty related to ai or other emerging technologies may require significant resources to adjust business practices to comply with developing laws . several governmental authorities have already proposed or enacted laws and other guidance governing ai , such as the proposed eu artificial intelligence act . these and other developing obligations may prevent or make it harder for us to conduct or enhance our business using ai , or lead to regulatory fines , penalties , or other liability . further , use of ai technologies could lead to unintended consequences , such as cybersecurity risks or unintended biases , impact our ability to protect our confidential data and intellectual property , and expose us to intellectual property infringement claims by third parties . risks related to doing business internationally • uneven economic growth or downturns or international trade and other global disruptions , geopolitical tensions , or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results . economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products , affecting our sales . declining tax revenues and increased government spending on other programs attributable to uneven economic growth or downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce healthcare spending , leading to increased control of drug prices or lower utilization . additionally , some customers , including governments or other entities reliant upon government funding and cash - pay patients , may be unable to pay for our products fully or in a timely manner . also , if our customers , suppliers , or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties , we could experience slower customer collections , greater bad debt expense , and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners . similarly , uneven economic growth or downturns could limit our ability to access capital markets . in addition , significant portions of our business are conducted in europe , asia , and other international geographies . trade and other global disputes and interruptions , including related to tariffs , trade protection measures , import or export licensing requirements , the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the u.s . or other governments , international tension and conflicts , as well as cost inflation , strains on global transportation , manufacturing , and labor markets , and public health outbreaks , epidemics , or pandemics , such as the covid-19 pandemic , affect our ability to do business . for example , tensions between the u.s . and china have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the u.s . on imports from china mainland , as well as other business restrictions . if geopolitical tensions were to increase and disrupt our operations in , or related to , china , such disruption would significantly impact our business . as a further example , the financial impact of higher energy prices , defense spending , and inflation due , in part , to geopolitical and economic disruptions , has further exacerbated financial pressures on governments with single - payer or government funded healthcare systems , leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates , clawbacks , and other reforms to reimbursement systems , particularly in europe . these and similar events have adversely affected , and may continue to adversely affect , us , our business partners , and our customers . for more details , see item [X] , "" business — regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing , reimbursement , and access . "" in addition to developments related to our business or financial results , or those of our competitors , uneven economic growth , downturns , or other negative global developments , could also undermine our growth or result in significant and sudden declines in the trading price of our common stock and market capitalization . • changes in foreign currency rates , interest rate risks , and inflation affect our results of operations . as a global company , we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates , interest rate risk from our exposure to floating and variable interest rates , and inflation risk from existing and expected rates of inflation in the u.s . and other jurisdictions , each of which impacts our results of operations . in recent periods , significant fluctuations in currency rates and inflation have impacted our results of operations . we are a net receiver of foreign currencies , and our results of operations are adversely impacted when the u.s . dollar is strong compared to foreign currencies . further , in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency in a particular market in which we operate , the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market . inflationary pressures in recent periods have also negatively impacted us and may continue to negatively impact us in various ways , including cost inflation , higher labor costs , and other higher expenses , with some of these higher expenses due in part to policy actions intended to curb inflation . see item [X] , "" management 's discussion and analysis — financial condition and liquidity "" and item [X] , "" financial statements and supplementary data — note [X] : summary of significant accounting policies and implementation of new financial accounting standards , "" for more details . risks related to government regulation and litigation • we face litigation and investigations related to our products , how we price or commercialize our products , and other aspects of our business , which could adversely affect our business , and we are self - insured for such matters . we are subject to a substantial number of claims involving various current and historical products , litigation , and investigations . these claims relate to how we commercialize and/or how we price our products , including relating to our 340b drug pricing program , product safety , as well as contractual matters and other disputes . see item [X] , "" financial statements and supplementary data — note [XX] : contingencies "" for more information on our current product liability litigation , as well as pricing and other litigation , investigations , and inquiries . like many companies in our industry , from time to time investigations into aspects of our business include inquiries , subpoenas , and other types of information demands from government and regulatory authorities . there continues to be a significant volume of government and regulatory investigations and litigation against companies operating in our industry , as well as increasingly robust regulatory enforcement . because of the nature of pharmaceutical products , we are , and could in the future become , subject to large numbers of product liability claims for our previous , current , or future products , or to further litigation or investigations , including related to product safety and pricing or other commercial practices . some of these matters involve numerous plaintiffs and parties seeking large or indeterminate financial claims and may remain unresolved for several years . such matters could negatively impact our reputation , affect our results of operations or require us to recognize substantial charges to resolve and , if involving marketed products , could adversely affect sales of the product and our consolidated results of operations in any given period . due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance , we are predominately self - insured for litigation liability losses for all of our currently marketed products , as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters . • we are subject to evolving and complex tax laws , which may result in additional liabilities and affect our results of operations . we are subject to income taxes in the u.s . and numerous other jurisdictions , and in the course of our business , we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events . changes in tax laws , regulations , administrative practices , principles , disclosure obligations , and interpretations , as well as events that differ from our expectations , have affected and may adversely affect our effective tax rates , cash flows , and/or results of operations . in addition , tax authorities in the u.s . and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of cross - border tax issues , which could unfavorably impact our results of operations . further , actions taken with respect to tax - related matters by associations such as the organisation for economic co - operation and development and the european commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate , such as the recent enactments by both the eu and non - eu countries of a global minimum tax . modifications to key elements of the u.s . or international tax framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate , results of operations , and cash flows . see item [X] , "" management 's discussion and analysis — executive overview — other matters — tax matters "" and item [X] , "" financial statements and supplementary data — note [XX] : income taxes , "" for more details . • regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company . the marketing , promotional , and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers , as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers , prescribers , and patients , are subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation . many companies , including us , are and have been subject to investigations , litigation , and claims related to these practices asserted by governmental authorities and other parties . these investigations , litigation , and claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences . the final outcomes of such investigations , litigation , and claims include criminal charges and fines , penalties , or other monetary or non - monetary remedies , including exclusion from u.s . federal and other healthcare programs . such investigations , litigation , and claims have intensified and may continue to intensify as a result of evolving u.s . and foreign regulatory priorities . new business practices or commercial capabilities may subject us to additional scrutiny over compliance with applicable regulatory schemes and compliance obligations or expose us to new regulatory schemes and compliance obligations entirely . in addition , regulatory issues concerning compliance with cgmp , quality assurance , evolving standards , and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines , and similar regulations and standards ( and comparable foreign regulations and standards ) for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions , product recalls and seizures , fines and penalties , interruption of production leading to product shortages , import bans or denials of import certifications , delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues , and reputational harm , any of which adversely affects our business . regulatory oversight of the pharmaceutical industry entails judgment and interpretation , which can result in inconsistent administration of laws and regulations by health authorities . regulatory compliance and processes in jurisdictions outside the u.s . may be particularly unpredictable and result in additional costs , uncertainties , and risks.u.s . and foreign governmental authorities are actively promulgating additional regulations that impact many aspects of our operations . these regulations are in some cases advanced with short notice . new regulations may undermine our ability to achieve business objectives , may be costly to implement , may provide only limited time for compliance , may change accounting and reporting standards , and may carry significant penalties for non - compliance . see item [X] , "" business — government regulation of our operations , "" for more details . furthermore , there is an increased focus by foreign , federal , state , and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change , regulating greenhouse gas emissions , carbon taxes , emissions trading schemes , sustainability , human rights and equity matters , and disclosure regarding the foregoing , many of which may be ambiguous , inconsistent , dynamic or conflicting . we expect to experience increased restrictions and compliance costs , legal costs , and expenses related to such new or changing legal or regulatory requirements . moreover , compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements would require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters . in addition , we may still be subject to penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices . additionally , we are subject to increased negative attention from the media , stockholders , activists , and other stakeholders on climate change , social , and sustainability matters . the perception that we have failed to act in a socially responsible manner , whether or not valid , results in adverse publicity that can negatively affect our business , brand , and reputation , as well as result in increased scrutiny from legislators and regulatory authorities . moreover , from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments , including to reduce our impact on the environment . our ability to achieve any stated environmental , social or governance goal , target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions , many of which are outside our control . examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements , the availability of requisite financing , and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other goals . if we fail to achieve , are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving , or improperly report our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments , it could negatively affect our reputation , brand , or investor confidence , and expose us to enforcement actions and litigation ."

risk pci or ami cardiogenic shock , and neurovascular care ( cerenovus ) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke . the orthopaedics portfolio ( depuy synthes ) includes products and enabling technologies that support hips , knees , trauma , and spine , sports & other . the surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies ( ethicon ) , as well as solutions that focus on breast aesthetics ( mentor ) , and ear , nose and throat ( acclarent ) procedures . johnson & johnson vision products include acuvue brand contact lenses and tecnis intraocular lenses for cataract surgery . these products are distributed to wholesalers , hospitals and retailers , and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians , nurses , hospitals , eye care professionals and clinics . geographic areas johnson & johnson and its subsidiaries ( the company ) have approximately [XXX,XXX] employees worldwide engaged in the research and development , manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field . the company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well - being . the products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under segments of business – innovative medicine and medtech . however , the principal markets , products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture . the products sold in international business include those developed in the u.s . and by subsidiaries abroad . investments and activities in some countries outside the u.s . are subject to higher risks than comparable u.s . activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies , restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties . raw materials raw materials essential to the company 's business are generally readily available from multiple sources . where there are exceptions , the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company . patents the company 's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible . they own , or are licensed under , a significant number of patents in the u.s . and other countries relating to their products , product uses , formulations and manufacturing processes , which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses . the company ’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties , including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the company 's key # # table_start # # table_end pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products . significant legal proceedings and claims involving the company 's patent and other intellectual property are described in note [XX] legal proceedings — intellectual property of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item [X] of this report . sales of the company ’s largest product , stelara ( ustekinumab ) accounted for approximately [XX.X] % of the company 's total revenues for fiscal [XXXX] . accordingly , the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company . janssen biotech , inc . , a wholly - owned subsidiary of johnson & johnson , owns patents specifically related to stelara . the latest expiring united states composition of matter patent expired in [XXXX] . as a result of settlements and other agreements with third parties , the company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of stelara before january [X] , [XXXX] in the united states . the latest expiring european composition of matter patent ( supplementary protection certificate ) expires in [XXXX] . sales of the company ’s second largest product , collectively darzalex ( daratumumab ) and darzalex faspro ( daratumumab and hyaluronidase - fihj ) , accounted for approximately [XX.X] % of the company 's total revenues for fiscal [XXXX] . accordingly , the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company . genmab a / s owns two patent families related to darzalex , and janssen biotech , inc . has an exclusive license to those patent families . the two patent families both expire in the united states in [XXXX] , and in europe , compound patent protection in select countries extends to 2031/2032 . janssen biotech , inc . owns a separate patent portfolio related to darzalex faspro . trademarks the company ’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means . these trademarks are protected by registration in the u.s . and other countries where such products are marketed . the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses . seasonality worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality ; however , spending has typically been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters . this reflects increased spending decisions , principally for research and development activity . competition in all of their product lines , the company 's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally . competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved . competition in research , both internally and externally sourced , involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes , is particularly significant . the development of new and innovative products , as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company ’s product portfolio , is important to the company 's success in all areas of its business . the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research . environment the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions . the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations . the company ’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures , cash flows , earnings or competitive position . # # table_start [XXXX] annual report # # table_end regulation the company ’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted , and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement . the company is subject to costly and complex u.s . and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the company 's financial condition and business operations . in the u.s . , the pharmaceutical product and medical technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies , primarily as to product safety , efficacy , manufacturing , advertising , labeling and safety reporting . the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the u.s . food and drug administration ( the u.s . fda ) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for u.s . fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction . similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the u.s . the new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy , data localization , and emerging cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation . within the u.s . , an increasing number of u.s . states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws and federal regulators ( e.g. , the u.s . fda , ftc and hhs ) continue to stress the intersection of health and privacy as a compliance and enforcement priority . in the eu , multiple directives and laws ( including nis2 , ehds , the data act , the cyber resilience act , and the ai act ) are rapidly changing privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new enforcement risks . in addition , china has introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations , with more anticipated , thereby increasing china ’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer practices . with other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws , local data protection authorities will force greater accountability on the collection , access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry . these laws can also restrict transfers of data across borders , potentially impacting how data - driven health care solutions are developed and deployed globally in a compliant manner . moreover , as a result of the broad scale release and availability of artificial intelligence ( ai ) technologies such as generative ai , a global trend towards more comprehensive and nuanced regulation ( e.g. , white house ’s executive order on the safe , secure , and trustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence ; the eu ai act ) to ensure the ethical use , privacy , and security of ai is underway that includes standards for transparency , accountability , and fairness , which will require compliance developments or enhancements . the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals , recalls , seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions . in some cases , the company ’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has been required or directed to . the u.s . fda and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities . if the u.s . fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations , or that any of our pharmaceutical products or medical technologies are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk , the u.s . fda could ban such products , detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products , order a recall , repair , replacement , or refund of such products , refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports , and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health . the u.s . fda may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us , our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company - wide basis , or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law . the u.s . fda may also recommend prosecution to the u.s . department of justice . any adverse regulatory action , depending on its magnitude , may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals , and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations . equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business . the costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study , investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world . in the u.s . , attention has been focused by states , regulatory agencies and congress on prices , profits , overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally . laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry . there is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers . various state and federal transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to certain healthcare practitioners , including physicians , teaching hospitals , and certain non - physician practitioners . federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti - bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official . payors and pharmacy benefit managers ( pbms ) are a potent force in the marketplace , and increased attention is being paid to the impact of pbm practices on healthcare cost and access in the u.s . our business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing , coverage , and reimbursement landscape . at the federal level , in august [XXXX] , president biden signed into law the inflation reduction act # # table_start # # table_end ( ira ) , which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish prices for certain high - spend single - source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the medicare program , starting in [XXXX] for medicare part d drugs and [XXXX] for medicare part b drugs . on august [XX] , [XXXX] , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( “ cms ” ) published the first “ selected drug ” list , which includes xarelto and stelara as well as imbruvica , which is developed in collaboration and co - commercialized in the u.s . with pharmacyclics llc , an abbvie company . the selected drug list also included other medicines targeting disease states that are prevalent in the medicare population . there remains uncertainty , however , regarding how the federal government will establish prices for the selected products , as the ira specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price . in any event , we anticipate that the selected products will be subjected to a government - established price for the medicare population . the ira also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of inflation , beginning october [X] , [XXXX] , for medicare part d drugs and january [X] , [XXXX] , for medicare part b drugs . separate ira provisions redesign the medicare part d benefit in various ways , including by shifting a greater portion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the part d coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program . failure to comply with ira provisions may subject manufacturers to various penalties , including civil monetary penalties . in july [XXXX] , janssen pharmaceuticals , inc . ( janssen ) filed litigation against the u.s . department of health and human services as well as the centers for medicare and medicaid services challenging the constitutionality of the inflation reduction act ’s ( ira ) medicare drug price negotiation program . the litigation requests a declaration that the ira violates janssen ’s rights under the first amendment and the fifth amendment to the constitution and therefore that janssen is not subject to the ira ’s mandatory pricing scheme . the impact of the ira on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain , as litigation filed by janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and cms has yet to publicly announce the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs . additionally , we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from congress , agencies , and other bodies at the federal and state levels , which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to increase pricing transparency and controls . there are a number of additional bills pending in congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing , including in the medicare and medicaid programs . this changing legal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the u.s . healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal and state law , and potential modification or repeal of these laws , will ultimately affect the industry . the ira and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products . in addition , business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny , particularly in the u.s . , by government agencies and state attorneys general , and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties . of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various jurisdictions , particularly in the european union , where significant fines have been levied on companies for data breaches , violations of privacy requirements , and unlawful cross - border data transfers . in the u.s . , the federal trade commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant settlements ( including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use and disclosure of personal health data ) and there have been a material increase in class - action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies . further , the company relies on global supply chains , and production and distribution processes , that are complex , and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing , supply and pricing of materials used in the company 's products . these processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals . # # table_start [XXXX] annual report # # table_end employees and human capital management as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , the number of employees was approximately : # # table_start [XXXX] employees [X] [XXX,XXX] full - time equivalent ( fte ) positions [X] [XXX,XXX] # # table_end [X] “ employee ” is defined as an individual working full - time or part - time , excluding fixed term employees , interns and co - op employees . employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and individuals on long - term disability are excluded . contingent workers , contractors and subcontractors are also excluded . [X] fte represents the total number of full - time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of individual employees as some work part - time . employees by region ( in percentages ) # # table_start # # table_end strategy the company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long - term strategy . management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the company 's desired corporate culture , including policies and processes related to strategy , risk management , and ethics and compliance . the company ’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas : • attracting and recruiting the best talent • developing and retaining talent • empowering and inspiring talent underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity , equity and inclusion ( dei ) , innovation , health , well -

term strategies . in furtherance of this objective , the company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone , regardless of where they are on their career journey . to prioritize learning , the company recently held johnson & johnson 's first global learning day . employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill - building courses across five areas : leadership , business skills , digital upskilling , dei , and well - being , on j&j learn , the company 's new learning platform . diversity , equity , and inclusion ( dei ) the company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating , fostering , and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion . the company ’s evidenced - based global enterprise diversity , equity and inclusion strategy recognizes how dei accelerates the company 's ability to meet the changing needs of the communities the company serves in , as outlined in our credo . the company ’s dei vision is : be yourself , change the world . the company 's dei mission is : make diversity , equity and inclusion how we work everyday . the company 's enterprise dei strategy is aligned to the dei vision and mission and rests on four core pillars : • build a workforce of individuals with diverse backgrounds , cultures , abilities and perspectives • foster a culture of inclusion where every individual belongs • transform talent and business processes to achieve equitable opportunities for all • drive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world the company 's dei strategy is guided by internal and external insights , global best practices and continual employee feedback and recognizes that while diversity changes by location , inclusion is the same everywhere . # # table_start [XXXX] annual report # # table_end compensation and benefits as part of the company 's total rewards philosophy , the company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent . the company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels . the company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible . the company 's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees ' well - being , including annual performance incentive opportunities , pension and retirement savings programs , health and welfare benefits , paid time off , leave programs , flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs . in recognition of the company ’s commitment to help employees balance their personal and professional responsibilities , the company enhanced its caregiver , bereavement , and volunteer paid leave benefits , effective july [XXXX] . health , wellness and safety the company ’s investment in employee health , well - being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees . with the right awareness , focus , practices and tools , the company ensures that all its employees around the world , as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the company 's sites , can work safely . the company has continuously expanded health and well - being programs throughout the company and across the globe , incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best - in - class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals . the programs and practices the company advances for total health — physical , mental , emotional and financial — ensure employee health protection for emerging health risks . the company continues to address our employees needs through j&j flex , a hybrid model that empowers the company ’s office - based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in - person and remote work . available information the company ’s main corporate website address is . the company makes its sec filings available on the company ’s website at , as soon as reasonably practicable after having been electronically filed or furnished to the sec . the company 's sec filings are also available at the sec ’s website at . investors and the public should note that the company also announces information at , and . we use these websites to communicate with investors and the public about our products , litigation and other matters . it is possible that the information we post to these websites could be deemed to be material information . therefore , we encourage investors and others interested in the company to review the information posted to these websites in conjunction with , the company 's sec filings , press releases , public conference calls and webcasts . in addition , the amended and restated certificate of incorporation , by -

effectiveness , technological innovations , intellectual property rights , product performance , real or perceived product advantages , pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement . the company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions , collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties . competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the company . competitors ’ development of more effective or less costly products , and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the company , could negatively impact sales of the company ’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development . the company may also experience operational and financial risk in connection with acquisitions if we are unable to fully identify potential risks and liabilities associated with acquired businesses or products , successfully integrate operations and employees , and successfully identify and realize synergies with existing businesses while containing acquisition - related strain on our management , operations and financial resources . for the company ’s innovative medicine businesses , loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market . similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product . for the company ’s medtech businesses , technological innovation , product quality , reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness . development by other companies of new or improved products , processes and technologies could threaten to make the company ’s products or technologies less desirable , less economical or obsolete . the company ’s business and operations will be negatively impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or technological advances that are safe , more effective , more effectively marketed or otherwise outperform those of our competitors . interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company ’s business , sales and reputation . the company ’s manufacturing of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex , high - quality components and materials . the company ’s subsidiaries operate [XX] manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world . the company has in the past , and may in the future , face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain . manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action , production quality deviations or safety issues , labor disputes , labor shortages , site - specific incidents ( such as fires ) , natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events , raw material shortages , political unrest , terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics . such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages , declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage . the company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products . any failure by or loss of a third - party manufacturer or supplier could result in delays and increased costs , which may adversely affect our business . the company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our raw materials , component parts and products . we depend on these third - party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs , to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices . however , we can not guarantee that these third - party manufacturers will be able to meet our near - term or long - term manufacturing requirements , which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business . # # table_start [XXXX] annual report # # table_end other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance , misappropriation of the company ’s intellectual property , limited ability to manage our inventory , possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us . moreover , if any of our third- party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities , loses benefits under material agreements , experiences power outages , encounters financial difficulties , is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency , the company may experience significant business disruption . in the event of any such disruption , the company would need to seek and source other qualified third - party manufacturers , likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely . counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues , earnings , reputation and business . our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet . third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products , which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards . to distributors and patients , counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version . counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated , unlicensed , uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents . the industry ’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products , potentially resulting in lost sales , product recalls , and an increased threat of litigation . in addition , diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability . global health crises , pandemics , epidemics , or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition . we are subject to risks associated with global health crises , epidemics , pandemics and other outbreaks ( such incident(s ) , a health crisis or health crises ) . for example , the covid-19 pandemic adversely impacted certain aspects of the company ’s business , results of operations and financial condition , including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products . the spread of any health crises may cause the company to modify its business practices , and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the company determines are in the best interests of our patients , customers , employees and business partners under such circumstances . while the company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network designed to help mitigate the impact of health crises , these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected in the event of a health crisis . health crises could adversely impact the company ’s operations , including , among other things , our manufacturing operations , supply chain , third - party suppliers , sales and marketing , and clinical trial operations . any of these factors could adversely affect the company ’s business , financial results , and global economic conditions generally . risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings global sales in the company ’s innovative medicine and medtech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures . sales of the company ’s innovative medicine and medtech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third- party payors such as government healthcare programs , private insurance plans and managed care organizations . as part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs , these payors are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed . in the u.s . , increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare , medicaid , and private sector beneficiaries , in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers , could result in further pricing pressures . in addition , recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny on pricing , coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures . specifically , the inflation reduction act of [XXXX] ( ira ) may subject certain products to government - established pricing , potentially impose rebates , and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government 's interpretations of the law to penalties . further , increased third - party utilization of the 340b federal drug discount program from expanded interpretations of the statute may have a negative impact on the company 's financial performance . outside the u.s . , numerous major markets , including the eu , united kingdom , japan and china , have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and , in that regard , directly or indirectly impose price controls , limit access to , or reimbursement for , the company ’s products , or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection . # # table_start # # table_end we are subject to an increasing number of costly and complex governmental regulations in the countries in which operations are conducted which may materially adversely affect the company ’s financial condition and business operations . as described in item [X] . business , the company is subject to an increasing number of extensive government laws and regulations , investigations and legal action by national , state and local government agencies in the u.s . and other countries in which it operates . for example , changes to the u.s . fda ’s timing or requirements for approval or clearance of our products may have a negative impact on our ability to bring new products to market . new laws and regulations may also impose deadlines on the company , or its third - party suppliers , manufacturers or other partners and providers , for which there may be insufficient time to implement changes to comply with such new regulations and may result in manufacturing delays or other supply chain constraints . if the company is unable to identify ways to mitigate these delays or constraints , there may be an adverse effect on sales and access to our products . the company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses , fines and reputational damage . in the ordinary course of business , johnson & johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as product liability , patent disputes and claims that their product sales , marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust , unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws . the company ’s more significant legal proceedings are described in note [XX] legal proceedings under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item [X] of this report . litigation , in general , and securities , derivative action , class action and multi - district litigation , in particular , can be expensive and disruptive . some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs , may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts , including punitive or exemplary damages , and may remain unresolved for several years . for example , the company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc , primarily johnson ’s baby powder , and the company ’s sale , manufacturing and marketing of opioids . while the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters , it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation . the company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters , potentially in excess of accruals , including matters where the company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants . the resolution of , or increase in accruals for , one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the company ’s results of operations and cash flows for that period . the company does not purchase third - party product liability insurance ; however , the company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits . product reliability , safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations , lead to litigation and cause reputational damage . concerns about product safety , whether raised internally or by litigants , regulators or consumer advocates , and whether or not based on scientific evidence , can result in safety alerts , product recalls , governmental investigations , regulatory action on the part of the u.s . fda ( or its counterpart in other countries ) , private claims and lawsuits , payment of fines and settlements , declining sales and reputational damage . these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image , brand equity and consumer trust in the company ’s products . product recalls have in the past , and could in the future , prompt government investigations and inspections , the shutdown of manufacturing facilities , continued product shortages and related sales declines , significant remediation costs , reputational damage , possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution . the company faces significant regulatory scrutiny , which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the company to government investigations , legal actions and penalties . the rapid increase in new government laws and regulations imposes significant compliance costs to the company and a failure of the company to timely implement changes to comply with these new laws may expose the company to investigations , legal actions or penalties . regulatory issues regarding compliance with current good manufacturing practices ( cgmp ) ( and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries ) by manufacturers of drugs and devices can lead to fines and penalties , product recalls , product shortages , interruptions in production , delays in new product approvals and litigation . in addition , the marketing , pricing and sale of the company ’s products are subject to regulation , investigations and legal actions including under the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act , the medicaid rebate program , federal and state false claims acts , state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws . scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the u.s . , and any resulting investigations and prosecutions , carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including , but not limited to , debarment from participation in government healthcare programs . any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company ’s business and results of operations . the most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in note [XX] legal proceedings — government proceedings under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item [X] of this report . # # table_start [XXXX] annual report # # table_end changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company ’s operating results . changes in tax laws or regulations around the world , including in the u.s . and as led by the organization for economic cooperation and development , such as the recent enactment by certain eu and non - eu countries , and the anticipated enactment by additional countries , of a global minimum tax , could negatively impact the company ’s effective tax rate and results of operations . a change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the company ’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted . this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company ’s consolidated statement of earnings . the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates . changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time , and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted . see note [X] income taxes under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item [X] of this report for additional information . the company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities . in connection with various government initiatives , companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world , which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries . the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves . however , any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the company ’s expectations , which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves . risks related to our intellectual property the company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business . the company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes . these rights are essential to the company ’s businesses and materially important to the company ’s results of operations . public policy , both within and outside the u.s . , has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights . the company can not be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the united states and other important markets or that such protections , once granted , will last as long as originally anticipated . competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the company ’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation , interferences , oppositions and other proceedings , such as inter partes review ( ipr ) proceedings before the united states patent & trademark office ( uspto ) . these proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable . in addition , challenges that the company ’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question . the company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the company ’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products . in the u.s . , manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity , or claim non - infringement , of innovator products through the abbreviated new drug application , or anda , process with the u.s . fda and related anda litigation . the biologics price competition and innovation act ( bpcia ) , enacted in [XXXX] , which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the u.s . fda of biosimilar alternatives to innovator - developed biological products , also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics . the ipr process with the uspto is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation . in the event the company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges , or upon the “ at - risk ” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product , the company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time . current legal proceedings involving the company ’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in note [XX] legal proceedings — intellectual property under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item [X] of this report . # # table_start # # table_end risks related to product development , regulatory approval and commercialization significant challenges or delays in the company ’s innovation , development and implementation of new products , technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the company ’s long - term success . the company ’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients , providers and consumers . development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the company ’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity . new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately [XX] % of [XXXX] sales . the company can not be certain when or whether it will be able to develop , license or otherwise acquire companies , products and technologies , whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval , and , if approved , whether the products will be commercially successful . the company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations , acquisitions , joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties . in all of these contexts , developing new products , particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices , requires significant investment of resources over many years . only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products . the process depends on many factors including the ability to : discern patients ’ and healthcare providers ’ future needs ; develop promising new compounds , strategies and technologies ; achieve successful clinical trial results ; secure effective intellectual property protection ; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis ; and , if and when they reach the market , successfully differentiate the company ’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment . new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition , changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns , resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third - party reimbursement . even following initial regulatory approval , the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real - world patient populations , as well as market entry of competitive products . the company leverages the use of data science , machine learning and other forms of ai and emerging technologies across varying parts of its business and operations , and the introduction and incorporation of ai may result in unintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities . ai technology is continuously evolving , and the ai technologies we develop and adopt may become obsolete earlier than planned . our investments in these technologies may not result in the benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive advantage . the application of machine learning and ai in our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws and regulations that may entail significant costs or ultimately limit our ability to continue the use of these technologies . these technologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security further described below . risks related to financial and economic market conditions the company faces a variety of financial , economic , legal , social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally . the company ’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial , economic , legal , social and political risks , including those listed below . foreign currency exchange : in fiscal [XXXX] , approximately [XX] % of the company ’s sales occurred outside of the u.s . , with approximately [XX] % in europe , [X] % in the western hemisphere , excluding the u.s . , and [XX] % in the asia - pacific and africa region . changes in non - u.s . currencies relative to the u.s . dollar impact the company ’s revenues and expenses . while the company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows , unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations . in addition , the weakening or strengthening of the u.s . dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the company ’s non - u.s . business activity are translated into u.s . dollars . inflation and currency devaluation risks : the company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates . specifically , the company has accounted for operations in argentina , turkey and venezuela as highly inflationary , as the prior three - year cumulative inflation rate surpassed [XXX] % . while the company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs , productivity improvements and periodic price increases , it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation . in addition , the impact of currency devaluations in # # table_start [XXXX] annual report # # table_end countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the company ’s operating results . illegal importation of pharmaceutical products : the illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the company ’s sales and profitability in the u.s . and other countries in which the company operates . with the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use , foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current u.s . law . however , the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower - priced imports has grown significantly . anti - bribery and other regulations : the company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials . those laws include the u.s . foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ) , which prohibits u.s . publicly traded companies from promising , offering , or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage . the company ’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials . also , in many countries outside the u.s . , the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities ; therefore , the company ’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa . in addition to the u.s . application and enforcement of the fcpa , various jurisdictions in which the company operates have laws and regulations , including the u.k . bribery act [XXXX] , aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior . enforcement activities under these laws could subject the company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions , which could include claims for civil penalties , criminal sanctions , and administrative remedies , including exclusion from healthcare programs . other financial , economic , legal , social and political risks . other risks inherent in conducting business globally include : • local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve , including interest rates , monetary policy , inflation , economic growth , recession , commodity prices , and currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash ; • protective economic policies taken by governments , such as trade protection measures , increased antitrust reporting requirements and enforcement activity , and import / export licensing requirements ; • compliance with local regulations and laws including , in some countries , regulatory requirements restricting the company ’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market ; • diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions ; • potential nationalization or expropriation of the company ’s foreign assets ; • political or social upheavals , economic instability , repression , or human rights issues ; and • geopolitical events , including natural disasters , disruptions to markets due to war , armed conflict , terrorism , epidemics or pandemics . due to the international nature of the company 's business , geopolitical or economic changes or events , including global tensions and war , could adversely affect our business , results of operations or financial condition . as described above , the company has extensive operations and business activity throughout the world . global tensions , conflict and/or war among any of the countries in which we conduct business or distribute our products may result in foreign currency volatility , decreased demand for our products in affected countries , and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs of materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers . most recently , we have experienced , and expect to continue to experience , impacts to the company 's business resulting from the russia - ukraine war , rising conflict in the middle east as well as increasing tensions between the u.s . and china . in response to heightened conflict , such as the russia - ukraine war , governments may impose export controls and broad financial and economic sanctions . our business and operations may be further impacted by the imposition of trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any country that favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors . additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the global community , including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file , prosecute and maintain patents , trademarks and other intellectual property rights . furthermore , in some countries , such as in russia , action may be taken that allows companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the united states and many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing the company 's inventions in russia or from selling or importing products in and into russia . # # table_start # # table_end weak financial performance , failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating or disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our liquidity , capital position , borrowing costs and access to capital markets . we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moody ’s investors service and standard & poor ’s ratings services . rating agencies routinely evaluate us , and their ratings of our long - term and short - term debt are based on a number of factors . any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency , whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control , can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur , reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts . there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings , and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings , including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade , may have a negative impact on our liquidity , capital position and access to capital markets . other risks our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented , highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce . our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds , experiences , and skill sets . the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire , develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization . maintaining our brand and reputation , as well as a diverse , equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent . if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts , or if we can not retain highly skilled workers and key leaders , our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected . in addition , effective succession planning is important to our long - term success . any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business , financial condition , or results of operations . climate change or legal , regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations . climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations , including an adverse impact on global temperatures , weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters . natural disasters and extreme weather conditions , such as a hurricane , tornado , earthquake , wildfire or flooding , may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain . the impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity , limiting our ability to access sufficient high - quality water in certain locations , which may increase operational costs . concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment . if such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations , we may experience disruption in , or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing , manufacturing and distribution of our products , which may adversely affect our business , results of operations or financial condition . further , the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences , and failure to provide climate - friendly products could potentially result in loss of market share . an information security incident , including a cybersecurity breach , could have a negative impact on the company ’s business or reputation . to meet business objectives , the company relies on both internal information technology ( it ) systems and networks , and those of third parties and their vendors , to process and store sensitive data , including confidential research , business plans , financial information , intellectual property , and personal data that may be subject to legal protection , and ensure the continuity of the company ’s supply chain and operations . the extensive information security and cybersecurity threats , which affect companies globally , pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks , including customer products that are connected to or rely on such systems and networks , and the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of the company ’s sensitive data . the company assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection , detection , and response capabilities , as well as ensure the company ’s third - party providers have required capabilities and controls , to address this risk . because of the frequently changing attack techniques , along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks , there is the potential for the company to be adversely impacted . this impact could result in reputational , competitive , operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action . also , increasing use of ai could increase these risks . the company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident ; however , the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial , legal , business or reputational losses . # # table_start [XXXX] annual report # # table_end as a result of increased global tensions , the company expects there will continue to be , an increased risk of information security or cybersecurity incidents , including cyberattacks perpetrated by adversaries of countries where the company maintains operations . given the potential sophistication of these attacks , the company may not be able to address the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate preventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly , or at all , which could adversely affect our business , results of operations or financial condition . moreover , these threats could also impact our third - party partners resulting in compromise of the company 's it systems , networks and data which could negatively affect the company . a breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access , loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact on the company ’s business or reputation . the company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection , use , storage , access , transfer and protection of personal data . breach of such requirements could result in substantial fines , penalties , private right of actions , claims and damage to our reputation and business . new privacy laws are expected in other territories , together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally , particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows . the company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with , but with many technology and data - driven initiatives being prioritized across the company and involving multiple vendors and third parties , there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border data flows , unauthorized access , and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact our business operations and research activities . the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits following the separation of kenvue inc . ( kenvue ) , including with respect to the company ’s remaining ownership interest . the company incurred significant expenses in connection with the kenvue separation ( the separation ) . in addition , the company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the separation . the anticipated benefits of the separation were based on a number of assumptions , some of which may prove incorrect . the company holds a [X.X] % ownership interest in kenvue . the company can not predict the trading price of shares of kenvue ’s common stock and the market value of the kenvue shares are subject to market volatility and other factors outside of the company ’s control . the company intends to divest its ownership interest in kenvue , but there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of such divestiture . unanticipated developments could delay , prevent or otherwise adversely affect the divestiture , including but not limited to financial market conditions . the separation could result in substantial tax liability . the company received a private letter ruling from the irs as to the tax - free nature of the separation under the u.s . internal revenue code of [XXXX] , as amended . notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax advisors , if the irs determines that certain steps of the transaction did not qualify for tax - free treatment for u.s . federal income tax purposes , the resulting tax liability to the company and its shareholders could be substantial . the separation may also not qualify for tax - free treatment in other countries around the world , and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the company . # # table_start # # table_end"

[XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end our r&d priorities and strategy . our r&d priorities include : • delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need ; • advancing our capabilities that can position us for long - term r&d leadership ; and • advancing new models for partnerships with creativity , flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible . to that end , our r&d primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas , which are inflammation and immunology , internal medicine , oncology , rare diseases , vaccines , and anti - infectives . while a significant portion of our r&d is internal , we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects , as well as our portfolio . we do so by entering into collaboration , alliance and license agreements with universities , biotechnology companies and other firms as well as through acquisitions and investments . these collaboration , alliance and license agreements and investments allow us to share knowledge , risk and cost . they also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise , as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and in - licensed or acquired products . for information on certain of these collaborations , alliances and license arrangements and investments , see note [X] . our r&d operations . in [XXXX] , we continued to strengthen our global r&d operations and pursue strategies to improve r&d productivity to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time . our r&d activity is conducted through various platform functions that support our global operations . beginning in july [XXXX] , in consideration of planned future investments in oncology , including the december [XXXX] acquisition of seagen , we reorganized our r&d platform operations . discovery to late - phase clinical development for oncology is performed by a new end - to - end oncology research and development ( ord ) organization and discovery to late - phase clinical development for all remaining therapeutic areas is consolidated into the end - to - end pfizer research and development ( prd ) organization . ord and prd replace our former wrdm and gpd organizations , where , prior to july [XXXX] , research units within wrdm were generally responsible for research and early - stage development assets and , prior to july [XXXX] , gpd was generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational execution of clinical trials for both early- and late - stage clinical assets in pfizer ’s pipeline . in [XXXX] , biopharma received r&d services from ord , prd and the predecessor wrdm and gpd organizations . these services included ipr&d projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in - line products . we manage r&d operations on a total - company basis through our prd and ord organizations described above . specifically , the portfolio management team , currently led by our chairman and chief executive officer and composed of other senior executives , is accountable for aligning resources across prd and ord , and for helping to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative r&d portfolio . we believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility . we do not disaggregate total r&d expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since , as described above , we do not manage all of our r&d operations by development phase or by therapeutic area . further , as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly , we believe that any prior - period information about r&d expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending . for additional information on our r&d operations , including r&d related costs and expenses , see the costs and expenses — research and development expenses section within md&a and note [XX] . our r&d pipeline . the process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten years . as of january [XX] , [XXXX] , we had the following number of projects in various stages of r&d : development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs . while our product candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval , new candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products . information concerning several of our drug and vaccine candidates in development , as well as supplemental filings for existing products , is set forth in the product developments section within md&a . the discovery and development of drugs , vaccines and biological products are time consuming , costly and unpredictable . for information on the risks associated with r&d , see the item 1a . risk factors — research and development section . collaboration and co - promotion agreements we use collaboration and/or co - promotion arrangements to enhance our development , r&d , sales and distribution of certain biopharmaceutical products , which include , among others , the following : • comirnaty is an mrna - based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent covid-19 , which is being jointly developed and commercialized with biontech . pfizer and biontech equally share the costs of development for the comirnaty program . comirnaty has been granted an approval or an authorization in many countries around the world in populations varying by country . we also share gross profits equally from commercialization of comirnaty and are working jointly with biontech in our respective territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide ( excluding china , hong kong , macau and taiwan ) , subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by market . for discussion on comirnaty , see the overview of our performance , operating environment , strategy and outlook — covid-19 section within md&a . • eliquis ( apixaban ) is part of the novel oral anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with bms as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate patients . we fund between [XX] % and [XX] % of all development costs depending on the study , and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countries where we commercialize eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to bms . in # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and bms supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end - customers . • xtandi ( enzalutamide ) is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with astellas . we share equally in the gross profits and losses related to u.s . net sales and also share equally all xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the u.s . market , subject to certain exceptions . in addition , we share certain development and other collaboration expenses . for international net sales we receive royalties based on a tiered percentage . • orgovyx ( relugolix ) is an oral gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( gnrh ) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and commercialized with smpa . the companies are also collaborating on myfembree ( relugolix [XX] mg , estradiol [X.X] mg , and norethindrone acetate [X.X] mg ) for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women and the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in premenopausal women . the companies equally share profits and allowable expenses in the u.s . for orgovyx , and in the u.s . and canada for myfembree . pfizer does not have rights outside of these markets . smpa remains responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continues to lead clinical development for the relugolix combination tablet . • padcev ( enfortumab vedotin - ejfv ) is a first - in - class adc that is directed to nectin-4 , a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer , that is being co - developed and jointly commercialized with astellas . in the u.s . , padcev has been approved for use with keytruda ( pembrolizumab ) for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer . other approvals and indications for padcev vary by market . in the u.s . , the companies jointly promote , and we record net sales and are responsible for all u.s . distribution activities for padcev . the companies each bear the costs of their own sales organizations in the u.s . , and equally share certain other costs associated with commercializing and any profits realized in the u.s . for padcev . outside the u.s . , we have commercialization rights in all countries in north and south america , and astellas has commercialization rights in the rest of the world . the agreement between us and astellas provides that the companies will effectively equally share in profits realized in markets outside of the u.s . through : ( i ) a costs - incurred and profit - sharing mechanism based on product sales and costs of commercialization in certain markets and ( ii ) a royalty - payment mechanism intended to approximate an equal profit share for both parties in the remaining markets . in addition , we have collaboration and/or co - promotion arrangements with respect to certain other biopharmaceutical products , including adcetris and tivdak as a result of our acquisition of seagen . revenues associated with these arrangements are included in alliance revenues ( except in certain markets where we have direct sales and except for the majority of revenues for comirnaty and padcev , which are included in product revenues ) . in addition , we have collaboration arrangements for the development and commercialization of certain pipeline products that are in development stage , including , among others certain of those described in the product development s section within md&a . for further discussion of collaboration and co - promotion agreements , see the item [X] . business — patents and other intellectual property rights section , the item 1a . risk factors — collaborations and other relationships with third parties section and notes [X] and [XX] . international operations our operations are conducted globally , and we supply our medicines and vaccines to approximately [XXX] countries and territories . emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership , and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest - growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets . urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets provide potential growth opportunities for our products . revenues from operations outside the u.s . of $ [XX.X] billion accounted for [XX] % of total revenues in [XXXX] . revenues exceeded $ [XXX] million in each of [XX] , [XX] and [XX] countries outside the u.s . in [XXXX] , [XXXX] and [XXXX] , respectively . the decrease in the number of countries exceeding $ [XXX] million in revenues from [XXXX] to [XXXX] was primarily driven by decreases in revenues related to comirnaty and paxlovid . as a percentage of total revenues , our largest country outside the u.s . was japan in [XXXX] . for a geographic breakdown of total revenues , see the total revenues by geography section within md&a and note 17b . our international operations are subject to risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries . see the item 1a . risk factors — global operations and item [X] . business — government regulation and price constraints sections . sales and marketing our prescription biopharmaceutical products , with the exception of paxlovid in [XXXX] and [XXXX] , are sold principally to wholesalers , but we also sell directly to retailers , hospitals , clinics , government agencies and pharmacies . in [XXXX] and [XXXX] , we principally sold paxlovid globally to government agencies . our vaccines in the u.s . are primarily sold directly to the federal government ( including the cdc ) , wholesalers , individual provider offices , retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems . our vaccines outside the u.s . are primarily sold to government and non - government institutions . certain of these government contracts may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of a government entity . our # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end contracts with government and supranational organizations for the sales of comirnaty and paxlovid , which are binding contracts , represented a significant amount of revenues in [XXXX] and [XXXX] . sales of comirnaty and paxlovid in the u.s . transitioned to commercial channels in the second half of [XXXX] . for information on our october [XXXX] amended agreement with the u.s . government regarding paxlovid , see note 17c . we also seek to gain access for our products on formularies , which are lists of approved medicines available to members of healthcare programs or pbms . pbms use various benefit designs , such as tiered co - pays for formulary products , to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions . we may also work with payors on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas . for information on our significant customers , see note 17c . we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients consistent with applicable laws . through our marketing organizations , we explain the approved uses , benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers and patients ; mcos that provide insurance coverage , such as hospitals , integrated delivery systems , pbms and health plans ; and employers and government agencies who hire mcos to provide health benefits to their employees . in the u.s . , we market directly to consumers through direct - to - consumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses , benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors . in addition , we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness , prevention and wellness , important public health issues and our patient assistance programs . as part of our commitment to engaging our customers in a manner they prefer , we take an omnichannel approach , including both virtual and in person interactions , and see generally positive customer response to both approaches . patents and other intellectual property rights patents . we own or have co - promotion and/or license rights related to a number of patents covering pharmaceutical and other products , their uses , formulations , and product manufacturing processes . patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained . the scope of protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and depends on the patent type , the scope of its patent claims and the availability of legal remedies . patent term extensions ( pte ) may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent term due to delay in a product ’s approval due to the regulatory requirements , while patent term adjustment may be available in some countries to compensate for administrative delays during prosecution of patents . one of the primary considerations in limiting our operations in some countries outside the u.s . is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products , although international and u.s . free trade agreements have included some global protection of intellectual property rights . see the item [X] . business — government regulation and price constraints section . in various markets , a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drugs or vaccines upon approval . the scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but , in general , the period will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval . based on current sales and other factors , and considering the competition with products sold by our competitors , the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole , together with the year in which the basic product patent expires , are as follows : # # table_start pfizer inc .

[XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end competition our business is conducted in intensely competitive and highly regulated markets . many of our products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications . the principal forms of competition include efficacy , safety , ease of use and cost . though the means of competition vary among our products , demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success . we compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat or prevent diseases or indications similar to those treated or prevented by our major products . these competitors include other worldwide research - based biopharmaceutical companies , smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and biosimilar manufacturers . our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to r&d and their successful r&d could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of our products in development , as well as product obsolescence . in addition , several of our competitors operate without large r&d expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration . to help address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation , which is underscored by our multi - billion - dollar investment in r&d , as well as our business development transactions , both designed to result in a strong and differentiated product pipeline . our investment in research continues even after drug or vaccine approval as we seek to further demonstrate the value of our products for the conditions they treat or prevent , as well as investigating potential new applications . we educate patients , physicians , payors and global health authorities on the benefits and risks of our medicines and vaccines , and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions , including our efforts to effectively launch and market our products to our customers . operating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures , industry regulation and cost containment . we continue to evaluate , adapt and improve our organization and business practices in an effort to better meet customer and public needs . we believe that we have taken an industry - leading role in evolving our ethical approaches to u.s . direct - to - consumer advertising , interactions with , and payments to , healthcare professionals and medical education grants . we also continue to support programs to address patient affordability and access barriers , as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through our support for better healthcare solutions . for example , in may [XXXX] , we launched an accord for a healthier world , which aims to provide our full portfolio of patented and off - patent medicines and vaccines for which pfizer holds global rights on a not - for - profit basis to [X.X] billion people living in [XX] lower - income countries around the world . our vaccines have and may continue to face competition , including from the introduction of alternative vaccines or “ next - generation ” vaccines prior to or after the expiration of their patents , which may adversely affect our future results . our biosimilars , which include biosimilars of certain inflammation & immunology and oncology biologic medicines , compete with branded products from competitors , as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers . we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “ first - to - market ” or early market position for our biosimilars to provide customers a lower - cost alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide us with higher levels of sales and profitability until other competitors enter the market . generic products . generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent protection and often charge much less . several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before their expiration . generic competitors often operate without large r&d expenses , as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community . in addition , the approval process in the u.s . and in the eu exempts generics from costly and time - consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy , allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product . in china , for example , given the expansion of the qce process and continuation of the vbp program , we expect to continue to face intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in [XXXX] and beyond , which has and may continue to result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products . in addition , generic versions of competitors ’ branded products have and may continue to compete with our products . commercial and government payors typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand - name drugs in their healthcare programs , including medicaid in the u.s . , and u.s . laws generally allow , and in some cases require , pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for brand - name drugs . in a small subset of states , prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution . similar rules also apply in several eu member states , where national authorities typically encourage and incentivize the use of generic products . biosimilars . certain of our biologic products , including enbrel ( we market enbrel outside the u.s . and canada ) , already face , or may face in the future , competition from biosimilars ( also referred to as follow - on biologics ) . biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety , purity or potency . biosimilars have the potential to offer high - quality , lower - cost alternatives to innovative biologic medicines . in the u.s . , biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved by the fda under the u.s . public health service act , whereas in the eu the ema is responsible for evaluating the majority of applications for biosimilars through the centralized procedure . pricing pressures and managed care organizations commercial pricing pressures . pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant . overall , there is increasing pressure on u.s . providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes . many employers have adopted or make available high deductible health plans , which can increase out - of - pocket costs for medicines . this trend is likely to continue . private third - party payors , such as health plans , increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing , which could result in lower prices , lower reimbursement rates for payors and a reduction in demand for our products , including denial of coverage of our products , if lower cost alternatives are available . payors often require significant discounts , or rebates , from our prices in exchange for more favorable formulary placement . pricing pressures also may occur as a result of highly competitive biopharmaceutical markets and increasing concentration of insurers and pbms . healthcare provider purchasers , directly or through group purchasing organizations , are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes . longer term , we foresee a shift in focus among payors and their pbms away from fee - for - service reimbursement towards outcomes - based payments and risk - sharing arrangements that reward providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes . these new payment models can , at times , lead to lower prices for , and restricted access to , new medicines . at the same time , these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions . further , these models may also encourage payors and their pbms to cover higher cost drugs where coverage is tied to patient outcomes and other quality incentives . # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end the impact of large - scale healthcare disruptions , like the covid-19 pandemic , on the pace of adoption of value - based payment models remains unclear . both payors and providers may resist adopting such models or choose to adopt such models at a slower pace if the incentives available do not outweigh the financial risk involved . adoption of such models , in particular models that involve downside risk , may depend on revenue predictability for hospitals and other institutional providers , many of which are still struggling to recover financially following the covid-19 pandemic . providers in more advanced value - based payment models , such as full capitation , a fixed amount paid in advance per - patient per - unit of time - period , generally found their revenues remained steady during the covid-19 pandemic , which may ultimately encourage the growth of such models . going forward , we expect continued focus on value - based payment models that support financial resiliency and advance healthcare equity by incorporating features intended to reduce disparities in healthcare quality and access experienced by underrepresented and underserved populations . we believe medicines and vaccines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system . we work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes , lower costs to the healthcare system , and help ensure access to medicines and vaccines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system . this includes assessing our go - to market model to help address patient affordability challenges . we have engaged with major payors and the u.s . government to explore opportunities to improve access and reimbursement in an effort to drive pro - patient policies . in addition , in response to the evolving u.s . and global healthcare spending landscape , we work with health authorities , health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major u.s . payors throughout the product - development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products . further , we are developing stronger support designed to demonstrate the net value of the medicines and vaccines that we discover or develop , register and manufacture . for information on government pricing pressures , see the item [X] . business — government regulation and price constraints and item 1a . risk factors — pricing and reimbursement sections . managed care organizations . the evolution of managed care in the u.s . has been a major factor in the competitiveness of the healthcare marketplace . approximately [XXX] million people in the u.s . now have some form of health insurance coverage , and the marketing of prescription drugs and vaccines to both consumers and the entities that manage coverage in the u.s . continues to grow in importance . in particular , the influence of mcos has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through mcos . at the same time , consolidation in the mco industry has resulted in fewer , even larger mcos , which enhances those mcos ’ ability to negotiate lower pricing and further increases their importance to our business . since mcos seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures , their growing influence has increased downward pressure on drug prices , as well as negatively impacted revenues . mcos and their pbms typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies ( which are lists of approved medicines available to mco members ) , clinical protocols ( which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine ) , long - term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs . in addition , by placing branded medicines on higher - tier or non - preferred status in their formularies , mcos transfer to the patient higher patient out - of - pocket expenses . this financial disincentive is a tool for mcos to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the mcos . we expect payment reforms for mcos will continue to evolve with increased emphasis on expanded participation and on removing barriers to equitable healthcare . the breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one mco to another , and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems . mcos emphasize primary and preventive care , out - patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors ’ offices and clinics as ways to manage costs . hospitalization and surgery , typically the most expensive forms of treatment , are carefully managed , and drugs that can help in chronic care management and reduce the need for hospitalization , professional therapy or surgery may become favored first - line treatments for certain diseases . at the same time , mcos may seek to exclude high - cost drugs from formularies in their efforts to manage and lower their costs . exclusion of a product from a formulary or other mco - implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population and beyond . consequently , pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products , typically on the basis of unique product features , such as greater efficacy , better patient ease of use , or fewer side effects , as well as the overall cost of the therapy . we continue to seek to ensure that our major products are included on mco formularies . however , our branded products are increasingly being placed on the higher tiers or in a non - preferred status . continuing efforts by managed care entities to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect demand for our products and our financial performance . see the item 1a . risk factors — managed care trends section . raw materials we procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide . in general , these materials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our demand and in many cases are available from multiple suppliers . no significant impact to our operations due to the availability of raw materials is currently anticipated in [XXXX] . however , we continue to see heightened demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials , which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading to a possible future impact on our business . we are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management , qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible . government regulation and price constraints we are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business . this includes laws and regulations governing the operations of biopharmaceutical companies , such as the approval , manufacturing and marketing of products , pricing ( including discounts and rebates ) and price reporting , interactions with healthcare professionals , institutions , and referral sources , reporting of remuneration provided to healthcare providers and academic medical centers , financial assistance provided to patients , clinical research , data privacy and information security , among others . these laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation , and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and/or administrative actions . enforcement measures may include substantial fines and/or penalties , orders to stop non - compliant activities , criminal charges , warning letters , product recalls or seizures , delays in product approvals , exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions , and could result in harm to our reputation and business . see note 16a . compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly , and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance . while capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end can not be predicted with certainty , we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position . in the u.s . drug and biologic regulation . the fda , pursuant to the ffdca , the public health service act and other federal statutes and regulations , extensively regulates pre- and post - marketing activities related to our biopharmaceutical products and devices . the regulations govern areas such as safety and efficacy , clinical trials , advertising and promotion , quality control , manufacturing , labeling , distribution , post - marketing safety surveillance and reporting , and record keeping . other u.s . federal agencies , including the dea , also regulate certain of our products and activities . for a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product , including vaccines , the fda must evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use . if the fda determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective , the fda will approve the product ’s nda or bla ( or supplemental nda or supplemental bla ) , as appropriate . a drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments , which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct , or postmarketing requirements , which are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval . in addition , we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cgmps ( the fda regulations that govern all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals ) and the drug supply chain security act ( the law that , among other things , sets forth requirements related to product tracing , product identifiers and verification for manufacturers , wholesale distributors , re - packagers and dispensers to facilitate the tracing of product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain ) , as well as advertising and promotion regulations . see the item 1a . risk factors — development , regulatory approval and marketing of products and — post - authorization / approval data sections . in the context of public health emergencies , like the covid-19 pandemic , we may apply to the fda for an eua which , if granted , allows for the distribution and use of our products during the declared emergency , in accordance with the conditions set forth in the eua , unless the eua is terminated by the government . although the criteria for an eua differ from the criteria for approval of an nda or bla , euas nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant fda standards , and a number of ongoing obligations . the fda generally expects eua holders to work toward submission of full applications , such as a bla or an nda , as soon as possible . biosimilar regulation . the fda is responsible for approval of biosimilars . innovator biologics , or reference products , are entitled to [XX] years exclusivity . applications for biosimilars may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed and may not be approved until [XX] years after the reference product was first licensed . sales and marketing regulations . our marketing practices are subject to federal and state laws , such as the anti - kickback statute ( aks ) , civil monetary penalties law and false claims act , intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry . the aks prohibits soliciting , offering , receiving , or paying anything of value to generate business that may be paid for , in whole or in part , by a federal healthcare program . the civil monetary penalties law covers a variety of conduct , often violations under other laws , and includes penalties for aks violations as well as causing the submission of false claims . the false claims act generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting , or causing to be presented , any claims for payment for goods or services , including to government payors , such as medicare and medicaid , that are false or fraudulent including false certifications of compliance with applicable law . the federal government and states also regulate sales and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers , requiring disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions , and the adoption of compliance standards or programs . state attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws . pricing , reimbursement and access regulations . pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation . any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or to expand controls on drug pricing , government reimbursement , and access to medicines and vaccines on public and private insurance plans could have a material impact on us . we must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various government programs including medicare , medicaid , the veterans administration and the 340b drug pricing program ( 340b program ) . we also must report specific prices to government agencies . the calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to enforcement measures . see the discussion regarding rebates in the product revenue deductions section within md&a and note [X] g . the drug pricing provisions of the ira , which was signed into law in august [XXXX] , began to be implemented in [XXXX] and implementation will continue over the next several years . the ira includes several provisions to lower prescription drug costs for medicare patients and to reduce drug spending by the federal government . among other things , the ira enhances the medicare part d benefit by eliminating the coverage gap ( “ donut hole ” ) beginning in [XXXX] , adds a maximum out - of - pocket cap for medicare beneficiaries ( set at $ [X,XXX] for [XXXX] ) , and creates a new program that allows patients to pay their cost - sharing over time . the law also requires manufacturers to provide a [XX] % discount on branded prescriptions in the initial coverage phase and a [XX] % discount in the catastrophic phase , imposes rebates under medicare part b and medicare part d on drug price increases that outpace inflation , and directs hhs to set the prices of certain high - expenditure , single - source drugs and biologics covered under medicare ( known as the “ medicare drug price negotiation program ” ) . in august [XXXX] , the biden administration published the first ten medicines subject to the medicare drug price negotiation program , which included eliquis . as a selected drug , cms will establish a “ maximum fair price ” for eliquis and that price will be published by september [X] , [XXXX] . the price will be in effect in [XXXX] . the maximum fair price established by cms is required to be offered to all medicare beneficiaries and to covered entities participating in the 340b program if that maximum fair price is lower than the discounted price such entities are offered under the 340b program ceiling price calculation . in addition , there will be a new medicare manufacturer discount program agreement expected to be signed in march [XXXX] that will change our discounting obligations for all medicines in medicare , with few exceptions , beginning in [XXXX] . the medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges and therefore , the outcome of the program remains uncertain . we continue to evaluate the impact of the ira on our business , operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the ira on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain . changes to the medicaid drug rebate program or the 340b program could have a material impact on our business . for example , certain changes finalized by cms in a december [XXXX] final rule , including which products qualify as so - called “ line extension ” drugs subject to increased rebate liability , may have a material impact on our business . additionally , in may [XXXX] , cms proposed new rules that could , if finalized , have a material impact on our business . those proposals include , for example , new rules regarding how manufacturers would be required to aggregate discounts for purposes of determining their medicaid best price . additionally , various potential changes to the 340b program are undergoing # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end review or are the subject of current regulatory activity and/or litigation , and their status is unclear . in [XXXX] , we implemented a policy that will help improve contract pharmacy integrity . the hhs health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , which administers the 340b program , has sent letters to numerous manufacturers that have also implemented contract pharmacy policies and integrity initiatives ; the letters express hrsa ’s view that those manufacturers ’ policies are in violation of the 340b statute . hrsa also has referred some of those other manufacturers to the hhs office of inspector general ( oig ) for potential enforcement action . pfizer has not received an enforcement letter from hrsa to date relating to our 340b program integrity initiative . several manufacturers have challenged hrsa ’s enforcement letters in federal court and litigation is ongoing in those cases . we believe that our policy is consistent with the statute . in addition , some states have enacted laws seeking to restrict manufacturer policies related to contract pharmacy transactions in their states . at least one state has begun to pursue enforcement proceedings under its law . several stakeholders have challenged such laws in certain states . other states have considered and could enact similar laws going forward , although any such laws also may be subject to legal challenges . additional legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340b program may have an adverse impact on our integrity initiative , and we may face enforcement action or penalties , depending upon such developments . the 340b program continues to be a subject of regulatory activity , congressional scrutiny and inquiries , litigation , and other developments , any or all of which could affect the scope of the program and pfizer ’s obligation to offer discounts to 340b program covered entities under the program . see the item 1a . risk factors — pricing and reimbursement section . states seek to control healthcare costs related to medicaid and other state regulated healthcare programs . a majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under medicaid , including some of our products . states may seek to negotiate supplemental rebate agreements that are larger than the minimum federal requirement for preferred formulary access . preferred access to our products under the medicaid managed care programs are often determined by the managed care health plans contracted by the state to administer benefits , which may also require supplemental rebates for preferred formulary access . we expect states will continue to seek cost cutting , which may focus on managed care capitation payments , supplemental rebates , and/or formulary management . we expect to see continued focus by congress and the biden administration on regulating pricing and access to medicine , in addition to actions already taken , which could result in legislative and regulatory changes . government and private payors routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products . there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and actions being taken at the state and federal level . further efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products , including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation , such as florida ’s drug importation program which was recently authorized by the fda , limit reimbursement to lower reference prices , require deep discounts , impose financial penalties related to pricing practices , and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written justification for the increase , could adversely affect our business if implemented . further , commercial payors often follow medicare coverage and reimbursement policies when setting their own payment rates . any reduction in cost or other containment measures may similarly be adopted by commercial plans . payors may continue to promote generic drugs and biosimilars more aggressively to generate savings and attempt to stimulate additional price competition . in addition , we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains , wholesalers and pbms will increase pricing pressures in the industry . see the item 1a . risk factors — managed care trends section . anti - corruption . the fcpa prohibits u.s . corporations and their representatives from offering , promising , authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official , government staff member , political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad . the scope of the fcpa includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries . other countries have enacted similar anti - corruption laws and/or regulations . data privacy . the number of privacy and data security laws and regulations in the u.s . to which we are subject on the federal and state level continues to increase . we routinely collect and use sensitive personal information relating to digital health . the legislative , regulatory and litigation landscape for privacy and data protection requirements is rapidly evolving and changing . these requirements are not universal and can conflict between jurisdictions . compliance with those laws and regulations is made more complex by the lack of consistent standards , common definitions , or clear regulatory expectations . at the same time , enforcement of these laws and regulations is increasing and litigation is becoming more common . any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations , including cybersecurity breaches or incidents , could subject us to significant fines and penalties , litigation , and negatively impact our reputation . outside the u.s . new drug approvals . in the eu , the ema conducts the scientific evaluation , supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal products that are eligible for the centralized marketing authorization procedure . through the centralized procedure , pharmaceutical companies may submit to the ema a single application for a marketing authorization valid in all the eu and the european economic area ( eea ) countries . the ec takes a legally binding decision based on the ema 's recommendation . for medicinal products that are not eligible for the centralized procedure , the mutual recognition procedure is based on the recognition of a pre - existing national marketing authorization by one or more eu member states , and the decentralized procedure allows the submission of a marketing authorization application simultaneously in several eu member states . in the u.k . , the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency is the sole regulatory authority . in japan , the pharmaceuticals and medical device agency is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities , including clinical studies , approvals , post - marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety . in china , the national medical product administration is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines . health authorities in many middle- and lower - income countries might require marketing approval or scientific opinions by a recognized regulatory authority ( e.g. , the fda or ema ) before they begin reviewing or approving applications . by way of example , the ema , in cooperation with the world health organization ( who ) , can provide scientific opinions on high priority human medicines , including vaccines , for markets outside the eu . in april [XXXX] , the ec proposed to revise the eu pharmaceutical legislation . the proposed legislation includes a significant focus on tackling inequalities on access , affordability and availability of medicines across the eu . the legislative process is ongoing and when eventually completed , it is likely to be the largest reform in over [XX] years to eu medicines regulation , with a wide range of impacts including on approval procedures , regulatory data protection and environmental protection measures . pharmacovigilance . in the eu , the ema ’s prac is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues . specifically , the prac focuses on detecting , assessing and communicating the risks associated with adverse reactions of medicinal products , while considering their therapeutic effects . it also evaluates post - authorization safety studies and conducts pharmacovigilance audits . outside developed markets , pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive , but there is a trend toward increasing regulation . pricing and reimbursement . certain governments , including in the different eu member states , the u.k . , japan , china , canada and south korea , provide healthcare at low - to - zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government - sponsored healthcare system , particularly under recent global financing pressures . governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs , including , among others , legislative or regulatory pricing reforms , cross country collaboration and procurement , price cuts , mandatory rebates , health technology assessments , forced localization as a condition of market access , “ international reference pricing ” ( i.e. , the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries ) , qce processes and vbp . in addition , the international patchwork of price regulation , differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some third - party trade in our products between countries . several important multilateral organizations such as the who scrutinize international pharmaceutical pricing through policy recommendations and sponsorship of programs , such as “ the oslo medicines initiative ” ( omi ) which aims to ensure “ affordability for high - priced medicines ” . the omi concluded its work in september [XXXX] , and the who / europe access to novel medicines platform was established to enhance affordable and equitable access to effective , innovative and high - priced medicinal products in the region . in china , pricing pressures have increased in recent years because of an overall focus on healthcare cost containment with the central government emphasizing improved health outcomes and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards its healthcare reform . state owned hospitals and the state insurance program account for the vast majority of all drug purchases . for patented innovative products , drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative drugs ( including oncology medicines , medicines for children and orphan drugs ) to the national reimbursement drug list via access - price negotiation . a centralized vbp program with a tendering process aims to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed qce . this has resulted in further lowering the price of medicines , especially off - patent medicines ; this trend is expected to continue . china is increasing its use of health technology assessment and is controlling mark - ups within the country using a two - invoice limited system , which is a government policy that regulates the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices . pfizer , along with most off - patent originators , have mostly not been successful in the vbp bidding process . the government has indicated that additional post - loe drugs ( including biological products ) could be subjected to vbp qualification in future rounds . certain of our products , such as sulperazon and vfend injectables , were included as candidates in vbp rounds in [XXXX] , and pfizer was not successful in the bidding process for such products . while certain details of future qce expansion have been made available , we are unable to determine the impact on our business of the various pricing measures underway . healthcare provider transparency and disclosures . several countries have implemented laws requiring ( or industry trade associations have recommended ) disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers and/or healthcare organizations , such as academic teaching hospitals . intellectual property . reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and r&d investment . the wto agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights ( wto - trips ) requires participant countries to provide patent and other intellectual property - related protection for pharmaceutical products by law , with a time - limited exemption provided for least - developed countries . while some countries have made improvements , we still face patent grant , enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries . while the global intellectual property policy environment has generally improved following implementation of wto - trips and bilateral / multilateral trade agreements , our growth and ability to bring new product innovation to patients depends on maintaining those standards and further progress in intellectual property protection . in certain developed international markets , governments maintain relatively effective intellectual property policies . however , in the eu , pursuant to the ongoing review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives , proposals introduced in [XXXX] may reduce the basic period of regulatory data protection from eight to six years , subject to the outcome of the ongoing legislative procedure . in several emerging market countries , governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines , as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals . multilateral institutions continue to address the role of intellectual property in the context of the covid-19 response , as well as pandemic preparedness and access to medicine more generally . considerable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions , restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions , revocation of patents , laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license , weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection . our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers , underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for all innovative industries ( both domestic and foreign ) and helping improve patients ’ access to innovative medicines and vaccines . data privacy . we are subject to extensive privacy and data protection laws and regulations around the world concerning the collection , use and sharing of personal data . we routinely collect and use sensitive personal information relating to digital health . the legislative , regulatory and litigation landscape for privacy and data protection requirements is rapidly evolving and changing . these requirements are not universal and can conflict between jurisdictions . compliance with those laws and regulations is made more complex by the lack of consistent standards , common definitions , or clear regulatory expectations . at the same time , enforcement of these laws and regulations is increasing and fines and penalties are also increasing . any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations , including cybersecurity breaches or incidents , could subject us to significant fines and penalties , litigation , and negatively impact our reputation . environmental matters our operations are affected by national , state and/or local environmental laws . we have made , and intend to continue to make , the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws . we also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites . we incurred capital and operational expenditures in [XXXX] for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean - up of certain past industrial activity as follows : $ [XX] million in environment - related capital expenditures and $ [XXX] million in other environment - related expenses . while capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance can not be predicted with certainty , we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or financial position . see also note 16a3 . as a science guided organization , we take a proactive approach to our environmental sustainability initiatives . in [XXXX] , we announced a new goal to further reduce greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions and achieve the science based target initiative ’s voluntary net - zero standard by [XXXX] . as part of this goal , pfizer aims to decrease its ghg emissions by [XX] % and its value chain emissions by [XX] % from [XXXX] levels by [XXXX] . to support our goal , we are developing and implementing our emission reduction plan , which will include strategies to achieve reductions throughout our value chain including investing in new technologies and innovative climate solutions , and setting expectations for our suppliers to establish science - aligned ghg emission reduction goals . our emission reduction plan - related expenses and capital spending incurred for [XXXX] were not # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end material to our consolidated financial statements . while we expect to incur incremental capital and operational expenditures to meet our goal , we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our financial position in the near term . longer term uncertainties such as the likelihood of commercially available technologies make it difficult to predict the financial impact of meeting the goal , and we will continue to assess and monitor the financial impact of the emission reduction plan . for a discussion of the risks associated with climate change and our environmental initiatives , see the item 1a . risk factors — climate change and sustainability section . our people our purpose is : breakthroughs that change patients ’ lives . these breakthroughs are delivered through the collaboration of our talented workforce . as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , including seagen colleagues , we employed approximately [XX,XXX] people worldwide , with approximately [XX,XXX] based in the u.s . women compose approximately [XX] % of our global workforce , and approximately [XX] % of our u.s.-based employees are individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds . our continued success links directly to the commitment , engagement and performance of our employees . it is important that we not only attract and retain the best and brightest talent , but also ensure they remain engaged and can thrive in an environment that is committed to helping them grow , succeed and contribute directly to achieving our purpose . at pfizer , prioritizing a positive colleague experience is of utmost importance , particularly during times of business transformation . we were conscious of the impact that the challenges and opportunities facing our business throughout the year had on colleagues . our goal is to prioritize the health and wellness of our colleagues , creating an environment where colleagues can excel in their work and advance our purpose . to achieve this , we strive to cultivate an inclusive and empowering work environment . this involves simplifying processes and eliminating unnecessary complexity , recognizing both performance and leadership skills , fostering career growth and internal mobility , and providing competitive compensation and benefits programs that promote mental and physical well - being . core values . to fully realize pfizer ’s purpose we have established a clear set of goals regarding what we need to achieve for patients and how we will go about achieving them . the “ how ” is represented by four simple , powerful company core values – courage , excellence , equity and joy . each value defines our company and our culture : • courage : breakthroughs start by challenging convention – especially in the face of uncertainty or adversity . this happens when we think big , speak up and are decisive . • excellence : we can only change patients ’ lives when we perform at our best together . this happens when we focus on what matters , agree who does what and measure outcomes . • equity : every person deserves to be seen , heard and cared for . this happens when we are inclusive , act with integrity and reduce healthcare disparities . • joy : we give ourselves to our work , and it also gives to us . we find joy when we take pride , recognize one another and have fun . diversity , equity and inclusion . at pfizer , every person deserves to be seen , heard and cared for . we embed diversity , equity and inclusion in our workplace and our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients ’ lives . as we work to bring together people with different backgrounds , perspectives and experiences we take specific actions to help foster an inclusive environment within pfizer and beyond , including , among others : ( i ) building a more inclusive colleague experience through representation and meaningful connections ; ( ii ) advancing equitable health outcomes by evaluating our work through the lens of the communities we serve , ( iii ) providing resources on allyship and the science behind inclusion to support all colleagues in having courageous conversations about equity , race and the avoidance of bias ; ( iv ) working to help transform society with external diversity , equity and inclusion partnerships , including deploying capital , engaging diverse suppliers and amplifying equity initiatives ; and ( v ) working to help ensure demographics of clinical trials correlate to those of the countries where trials are taking place . colleague engagement . to attract , develop and inspire the brightest talent , we aim to support our colleagues by engaging and partnering with them to help ensure they feel they are part of a community . we understand that continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback is essential to fostering a healthy work environment particularly during times of change and uncertainty . we are passionate about creating safe spaces at work so our employees feel able and encouraged to provide the company with feedback . the office of the ombuds is a resource where all pfizer colleagues at any level can come to get information and guidance to help them address and resolve work - related issues . we also host company - wide safe space calls and provide various other public , private and anonymous channels for employees to share feedback without fear of retaliation . our annual engagement survey , pfizer pulse , provides a forum for our colleagues to give structured feedback about their colleague experience . through this survey , we measure and track priority areas of the overall colleague experience and equip leaders with actionable insights for discussion and follow up . regular topics in the survey include : ( i ) employee engagement , such as colleagues ’ commitment to and advocacy for pfizer ; ( ii ) purpose , including how colleagues ’ work connects with our purpose ; ( iii ) inclusion , such as having a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued ; ( iv ) empowerment , such as colleagues feeling empowered and enabled to do their best work together ; and ( v ) growth , including the ability for colleagues to gain new experiences that align with their individual career goals . in addition , we ask for feedback at various points in the employee lifecycle through surveys , focus groups and colleague forums . the information we receive helps enable us to adapt to the real - time needs of our employees and continuously improve our ways of working . while we have already made progress in reducing bureaucracy and streamlining processes , we recognize that there is still room for improvement , particularly in the effectiveness of our cross - functional teams . throughout [XXXX] , we have developed and tested a new approach that aims to expedite decision - making , provide clarity in roles and responsibilities , enhance governance , redefine the role of a leader , and ultimately improve overall team productivity and performance . this new way of working signifies our commitment to becoming a more dynamic organization that thrives on collaboration and agility . by revolutionizing the way our teams operate , we believe we can drive better business outcomes and , most importantly , make a meaningful difference in the lives of people around the world . pfizer also prioritizes colleague recognition to drive engagement , a sense of belonging , motivation , and productivity . our global rewards and recognition program , bravo , lets colleagues celebrate and acknowledge each other for demonstrating pfizer values in a way that makes an impact on the company , a colleague , a team or a patient . in [XXXX] , [XX] % of colleagues were recognized , and more than [XXX,XXX] recognitions were given . # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end performance and leadership . we understand the significance of leadership and its crucial role in promoting growth and delivering breakthrough results . we believe that each of our colleagues has the potential to lead in a unique way and create a meaningful impact on a global scale . to support this belief , we have developed a new leadership profile for our colleagues that aligns with our company values of courage , excellence , equity and joy . we believe this renewed focus on leadership applies to all colleagues , which may help us to foster transformational thinking and executional excellence . by pursuing these leadership qualities , we believe pfizer can help ensure that its leaders and colleagues are aligned with the company ’s values , behaviors and purpose , which may help lead to better outcomes and a positive impact on the lives they touch . we are committed to helping our colleagues reach their full potential by rewarding both their performance and leadership skills and by providing opportunities for growth and development . our performance management approach — called performance and leadership insights — is based on six - month semesters during which our colleagues and their managers set goals , receive feedback and meet to discuss performance . these conversations are meant to help colleagues grow and develop by evaluating performance ( what the colleague achieved , measured by outcomes ) , leadership ( how they achieved it , taking into account pfizer ’s values of courage , excellence , equity and joy ) , and identifying areas of growth that help move colleagues towards fulfilling their career goals and their potential . growth and development . by prioritizing the ongoing development of our employees , we not only support their individual success but also cultivate a resilient and adaptable workforce that can thrive in the face of change . as we navigate the evolving landscape of our industry , we recognize that providing our employees with opportunities for learning , skill - building and growth is essential to their engagement , productivity , and overall job satisfaction . in [XXXX] , we continued to maintain low voluntary turnover rates relative to the pharmaceutical industry . our view of career growth is built on aspirations and empowers individuals to boldly own their growth journey . we deepened our efforts to redefine growth as a fluid process that promotes incremental in - role growth or mobility along horizontal , vertical or diagonal individualized pathways — what we are calling “ zig - zag ” growth . our commitments to colleague development consist of specific actions to encourage non - linear “ zig - zag ” career growth paths for all colleagues , including ( i ) a common language around growth — along with a guiding framework — to help colleagues identify their next best growth experience , ( ii ) tools and resources to encourage growth conversations and offer transparency on the sources of growth available , and ( iii ) a variety of opportunities to grow through experiences , connections with others and learning programs , including mentoring , job rotations , experiential projects , skill - based volunteering and personalized learning pathways that address a variety of topics , including leadership and management skills and industry- and job - specific learning , as well as general business , manufacturing , finance and technology skills . health , safety and well -

looking statements , as discussed in the forward - looking information and factors that may affect future results section . risks related to our business , industry and operations : managed care trends private payors , such as health plans , and other managed care entities , such as pbms , continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs in the u.s . , the single largest market for biopharmaceutical products . the negotiating power of mcos and other private third - party payors has increased due to consolidation , and they , along with state and federal governments , increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs , including through the use of deductibles , utilization management tools , cost sharing or formulary placement . they may demand rebates from biopharmaceutical manufacturers for preferred placement on a drug formulary . the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or life threatening conditions , typically with a relatively higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products , also has generated increased payor interest in development of cost - containment strategies . these initiatives have increased consumers ’ interest in drug prices and input in medication choices , as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lower - cost generic alternatives . we may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products , or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing net of rebates . third - party payors also use additional measures such as new - to - market blocks , exclusion lists , indication - based pricing and value - based pricing / contracting to improve their cost containment efforts and cost efficiency . such payors are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools requiring prior authorization for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more other products before permitting access to a particular branded medicine . as the u.s . private third - party payor market consolidates further , and as the ira prices become publicly available , we may face greater pricing pressure from private third - party payors as they continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost alternatives # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end or seek even larger rebates to control costs or offset losses from the ira . for additional information on the ira , see the item [X] . business — government regulation and price constraints section . also , business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny , and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action , as well as evolving judicial interpretations . our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government and industry guidance . competitive products competitive product launches have and may erode future sales of our products , including our existing products and those currently under development , or result in product obsolescence . such launches continue to occur , and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development . we can not predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat or prevent diseases and conditions like those treated or prevented by our in - line products and product candidates . some of our competitors may have competitive , technical or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas , and consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages . these advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover , develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market . our products have been competing and may continue to compete , and our product candidates may compete , against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts , exclusionary contracting , lower prices , equivalent or superior efficacy , better safety profiles , easier administration , earlier market availability or other competitive features . if we are unable to compete effectively , this could reduce sales , which could negatively impact our results of operations . in addition , competition from manufacturers of generic drugs , including from generic versions of competitors ’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity , is a major challenge for our branded products . certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years . we anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in [XXXX] through [XXXX] as several of our in - line products experience patent - based expirations . see the item [X] . business — patents and other intellectual property rights section . in china , we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers , which has resulted , and may result in the future , in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products . in addition , our patented products may face generic or biosimilar competition before patent exclusivity expires , including from “ at - risk ” launch ( despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic or biosimilar product ) by a manufacturer of a generic or biosimilar version of one of our patented products . generic and biosimilar manufacturers have filed or could file applications with the fda seeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our or our collaboration and licensing partners ’ patents or claim that our or our collaboration and licensing partners ’ patents are not valid . we and our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges in various jurisdictions by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have patent rights , licenses or co - promotion rights . see note 16a1 . we may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars . we also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others , including other biosimilar products . the entry to the market of competing biosimilars is expected to increase pricing pressures on our biosimilar products . uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors , such as anti - competitive practices , access challenges where our product may not receive appropriate coverage / reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product , physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the reference product , or misaligned financial incentives for certain prescribers . for additional information on competition our products face , see the item [X] . business — competition section . concentration we recorded direct product and/or alliance revenues of more than $ [X] billion for each of nine products that collectively accounted for [XX] % of total revenues in [XXXX] . in particular , comirnaty accounted for [XX] % of total revenues in [XXXX] . see notes [X] and [XX] . if these products or any of our other major products were to , or continue to ( if applicable ) , experience loss of patent protection ( if applicable ) , changes in prescription or vaccination purchasing or growth rates , reduced product demand , material product liability litigation , unexpected side effects or safety concerns , regulatory proceedings or investigations , lower governmental and/or regulatory confidence , negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence , pressure from competitive products , changes in labeling , pricing and access pressures or supply shortages or if a new , more effective product should be introduced , the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant and our revenue forecasts and expectations could prove to be inaccurate and we may fail to meet these expectations . in particular , certain of our products have experienced patent - based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years . we anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in [XXXX] through [XXXX] as several of our in - line products experience patent - based expirations . in addition , patents covering a number of our best - selling products are , or have been , the subject of pending legal challenges . for additional information on our patents , see the item [X] . business — patents and other intellectual property rights section . for comirnaty and paxlovid , while we believe that these products have the potential to provide ongoing revenue streams for pfizer for the foreseeable future , revenues of these products following the covid-19 pandemic have decreased substantially , and our current expectations for total covid-19 product revenues in [XXXX] are lower than the total [XXXX] revenues from covid-19 products . for information on risks associated with comirnaty and paxlovid , see the covid-19 section below . in addition , certain of our customers account for a significant portion of our revenues . if one of our significant customers should encounter financial or other difficulties , it might decrease the amount of business such customer does with us and/or we might be unable to timely collect all the amounts that such customer owes us or at all , which could negatively impact our results of operations . in addition , we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers , including us . see note 17c for a discussion of our significant customers . research and development the discovery and development of new products , as well as the development of additional uses for existing products , are necessary for the continued strength of our business . our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends , as well as to provide for earnings growth , primarily through internal r&d or through collaborations , acquisitions , jvs , licensing or other arrangements . growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payors . however , balancing current growth , investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge . the costs of product development continue to be high and are growing , as are regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas , which may affect the complexity of drug trials , and the number of candidates we are able to fund as well as the sustainability of the r&d portfolio . decisions made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payor reimbursement possibilities if the candidate receives regulatory approval . we try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges , but there is no assurance that an optimal balance between trial conduct , speed and desired outcome will be achieved . additionally , our product candidates can fail at any stage of the r&d process , and may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of r&d . we may fail to correctly identify compounds or indications for which our science is promising or allocate r&d investment resources efficiently , and failure to invest in the right technology platforms , therapeutic areas , product classes , geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline . further , even if we identify areas with the greatest commercial potential , the scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for r&d , and the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic regulatory and market environments and the hurdles in terms of access , coverage and reimbursement . for example , certain of our gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology with only a handful of gene therapies approved to date , which make it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and the ability to obtain regulatory approval . global operations we operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency and interest rate fluctuations ; capital and exchange controls ; local and global economic conditions including inflation , recession , volatility and/or lack of liquidity in capital markets ; expropriation and other restrictive government actions ; changes in intellectual property ; legal protections and remedies ; trade regulations ; tax laws and regulations ; and procedures and actions affecting approval , production , pricing , and marketing of , reimbursement for and access to our products , as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action , including the ongoing conflicts between russia and ukraine and in the middle east and their economic consequences , geopolitical instability , terrorist activity , unstable governments and legal systems , inter - governmental disputes , public health outbreaks , epidemics , pandemics , natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change . some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial , economic or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending . as a result of these and other factors , our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful , and any growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable . additionally , local economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of payors , as well as our distributors , customers , suppliers and service providers , to pay for our products , or otherwise to buy necessary inventory or raw materials , and to perform their obligations under agreements with us . government financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices , access criteria ( e.g. , through health technology assessments ) or other means of cost control . for additional information on government pricing pressures , see the item [X] . business — government regulation and price constraints section . we continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments that could impact our business . if trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic activity , potential impacts could include declining sales ; increased costs ; volatility in foreign exchange rates ; a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments ; required increases of our pension funding obligations ; increased government cost control efforts ; delays or failures in the performance of customers , suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business ; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate . we operate in many countries and transact in many different currencies . changes in the value of those currencies relative to the u.s . dollar , or high inflation or deflation in those countries , can impact our revenues , costs and expenses and our financial guidance . significant portions of our revenues , costs and expenses , as well as our substantial international net assets , are exposed to exchange rate changes . [XX] % of our total [XXXX] revenues were derived from international operations , including [XX] % from europe and [XX] % from japan , china and the rest of the asia pacific region . future changes in exchange rates or economic conditions and the impact they may have on our results of operations , financial condition or business are difficult to predict . for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk , see the analysis of financial condition , liquidity , capital resources and market risk section within md&a . in addition , our borrowing , pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligations and interest - bearing investments are subject to risk from changes in interest and exchange rates . the risks related to interest - bearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the analysis of financial condition , liquidity , capital resources and market risk section within md&a and note 7e . for additional details on critical accounting estimates and assumptions for our benefit plans , see the significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions — benefit plans section within md&a and note [XX] . product manufacturing , sales and marketing risks we could encounter difficulties , delays or inefficiencies in our supply chain , product manufacturing and distribution networks , as well as sales or marketing , due to regulatory actions , shut - downs , work stoppages or strikes , approval delays , withdrawals , recalls , penalties , supply disruptions , shortages or stock - outs at our facilities or third - party facilities that we rely on , reputational harm , the impact to our facilities due to health pandemics or natural or man - made disasters , including as a result of climate change , product liability or unanticipated costs . examples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase or maintain production capacity commensurate with demand ; challenges related to component materials to maintain supply and/or appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network and/or comply with applicable regulations ; inability to supply certain products due to voluntary product recalls ; and supply chain disruptions at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor . in addition , we engage contract manufacturers , and , from time to time , our contract manufacturers may face difficulties or are unable to manufacture our products at the necessary quantity or quality levels . regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities , as well as third - party facilities that we rely on , to evaluate compliance with cgmp or other applicable requirements . failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions , such as warning letters , suspension of manufacturing , seizure of product , injunctions , debarment , product recalls , delays or denials of product approvals , import bans or denials of import certifications . in [XXXX] , pfizer recalled all lots of chantix in the u.s . due to the presence of a nitrosamine , n - nitroso - varenicline , at or above the fda interim acceptable intake limit . regulatory authorities outside the u.s . have issued updated guidance on nitrosamine acceptable intake levels . with this recently issued guidance , which included an updated intake level for n - nitroso - varenicline , we expect to make regulatory submissions in [XXXX] to potentially enable chantix to return to market outside the u.s . , and our related discussions with fda are ongoing . # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end our manufacturing facility in rocky mount , nc was damaged by a tornado in july [XXXX] . while manufacturing has resumed , the supply of medicines impacted by the tornado is expected to be affected through [XXXX] . see the overview of our performance , operating environment , strategy and outlook — our operating environment section within md&a . collaborations and other relationships with third parties we depend on third - party collaborators , service providers , and others in the research , development , manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into jvs and other business development transactions . to achieve expected longer - term benefits , we may make substantial upfront payments as part of these transactions , which may negatively impact our earnings or cash flows . we rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development , manufacturing and commercialization activities , but we do not control many aspects of those activities . we also outsource certain services , including activities related to transaction processing , accounting , it , manufacturing , clinical trial recruitment and execution , clinical lab services , non - clinical research , safety services , integrated facilities management and other areas . failure by one or more of the third - party collaborators , service providers and others to complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations or to meet their contractual or other obligations to us ; failure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations ; disruptions in one or more of these parties ’ businesses , including unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials or components , cyber - attacks on supplier systems , labor disputes or shortage and inclement weather , as well as natural or man - made disasters or pandemics ; or any disruption in the relationships between us and these parties have or could delay or prevent the development , approval , manufacturing or commercialization of our products and product candidates , expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables , result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues , erroneous data and supply disruptions , and could also result in non - compliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or subject us to reputational harm , all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business . further , our alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co - promotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time . counterfeit products our reputation , in - line and pipeline portfolios render our medicines and vaccines prime targets for counterfeiters . counterfeits pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured — often in unregulated , unlicensed , uninspected , and unsanitary sites — as well as the lack of regulation of their contents . failure to mitigate this threat could adversely impact pfizer ’s patients , potentially causing them harm . this situation , in turn , may result in the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines and vaccines , and potentially impact our business through lost sales , product recalls , and possible litigation . the prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industry - wide issue due to a variety of factors , including the adoption of e - commerce . the increased adoption during the covid-19 pandemic further exposed consumers to fake prescription treatments via the internet as access to traditional brick and mortar pharmacies or authorized full - service internet pharmacies that offer authentic treatments may have been hindered . the internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams that target unsuspecting consumers . traffic to these generally deceptive pharmacy sites is largely driven by misplaced trust in sophisticated internet retailers and social media offers coupled with the convenience e - commerce affords consumers . counterfeiters generally target any medicine or vaccine boasting strong demand and we have observed heightened counterfeit and fraud attempts to our internal medicine portfolio , as well as products utilized in the treatment of covid-19 . we consistently invest in an enterprise - wide strategy to aggressively combat counterfeit threats by educating patients and healthcare providers about the risks , investing in innovative technologies to detect and disrupt sophisticated internet offers and scams , proactively monitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcement , and advising legislators and regulators . however , our efforts and those of others may not be entirely successful , and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase . risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings : pricing and reimbursement u.s . and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls or limitations on patient access to our products , create coverage criteria or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business , and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies . in addition to the recent expansion of price controls in the u.s . in the ira , the adoption of restrictive coverage policies and price controls in new jurisdictions , more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate coverage and pricing could also adversely impact revenue . we expect pricing pressures and other cost containment measures for drugs and vaccines will continue globally . in the u.s . , pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform , and many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a result . we expect to see continued focus by the u.s . congress and the biden administration on regulating pricing and access to medicine . for example , in august [XXXX] , the drug pricing provisions of the ira were signed into law , which , among other things , require manufacturers of certain drugs , including pfizer , to engage in price negotiations with medicare which will permit the cms to set a maximum fair price for selected drugs , impose rebates under medicare part b and medicare part d to penalize price increases that outpace inflation , and replace the part d coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program . the drug pricing provisions of the ira began to be implemented in [XXXX] and implementation efforts are expected to continue over the next several years . in august [XXXX] , the biden administration unveiled the first round of medicines subject to the medicare drug pricing negotiation program , which included eliquis . cms will establish a maximum fair price for eliquis that will be in effect in [XXXX] . that maximum fair price will be required to be offered to all medicare beneficiaries and to covered entities participating in the 340b program if lower than the 340b price . health plans may also require rebates in addition to the maximum fair price for preferred placement on a medicare plan formulary . the medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges and therefore , the outcome of the 340b program remains uncertain . we continue to evaluate the impact of the ira on our business , operations , financial condition and results as the full effect of the ira on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain . payors may promote generic drugs and biosimilars more aggressively to generate savings and attempt to stimulate additional price competition . in addition , we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains , wholesalers and pbms will increase pricing pressures in the industry . some states have implemented , and others are considering , patient access constraints or cost cutting under state regulated programs including the medicaid program . state legislatures also have continued to focus on addressing drug costs , generally by increasing price transparency or attempting to limit drug price increases for state regulated insurance . measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end products , including legislation on drug importation , such as florida ’s drug importation program which was recently approved by the fda , could adversely affect our business . for additional information on u.s . pricing and reimbursement , see the item [X] . business — government regulation and price constraints section . we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate . in certain markets , such as in eu member states , the u.k . , japan , china , canada and south korea , governments have significant power as large single payors to regulate prices , access criteria , or impose other means of cost control , particularly as a result of recent global financing pressures . for example , the qce and vbp tender process in china has resulted in significant price cuts for off - patent medicines . additionally , in the eu , the ec proposed the largest reform to drug pricing and access in [XX] years , which if enacted would change regulatory exclusivity for our products . for additional information regarding these government initiatives , see the item [X] . business — government regulation and price constraints section . we anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally . in addition , in many countries , with respect to our vaccines , we participate in a tender process for selection in national immunization programs . failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business . pricing pressures have been , and we anticipate will continue to be , amplified by covid-19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for covid-19 treatments and vaccines . u.s . healthcare regulation the u.s . healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes . any significant additional efforts at the u.s . federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us . for additional information on u.s . healthcare regulation , see the item [X] . business––government regulation and price constraints section . other u.s . federal or state legislative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business , including , among others , general budget control actions , changes in patent laws , the importation of prescription drugs to the u.s . at prices that are regulated by foreign governments , revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government programs that could reference international prices or require new discounts , limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders , or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines . any additional reduction of u.s . federal spending on entitlement programs beyond the ira , including medicare and medicaid , may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products . any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting medicare , medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations . the ira will be implemented largely through government guidance and as its effect on medicare and commercial markets evolve , we will continue to evaluate the potential impacts to our business . we expect additional cost containment measures at both the federal and state levels as efforts to reduce drug costs continue . further , commercial payors often follow medicare coverage policy and payment limitations when setting their own payment rates . any reduction in cost or other containment measures may similarly be adopted by commercial plans . coverage policies and reimbursement rates for commercial plans may change at any time . even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products , less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future . development , regulatory approval and marketing of products the discovery and development of drugs , vaccines and biological products are time consuming , costly and unpredictable . the outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk due to the following factors , among others : • the process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years and have high costs . • we may have difficulties recruiting and enrolling patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis . • product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process , including as the result of unfavorable pre - clinical and clinical trial results , or unfavorable new pre - clinical or clinical data and further analyses of existing pre - clinical or clinical data , including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication . • we may need to amend our clinical trial protocols or conduct additional clinical trials under certain circumstances , for example , to further assess appropriate dosage or collect additional safety data . • we may not be able to meet anticipated pre - clinical or clinical endpoints , commencement and/or completion dates for our pre - clinical or clinical trials , regulatory submission dates , regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates . • we may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the fda and the ema , or be able to obtain approval for new products and indications from regulators . regulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors , including regulatory determinations as to the product ’s safety and efficacy . in the context of public health emergencies like the covid-19 pandemic , regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency or conditional basis . additionally , clinical trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities . as a result of regulatory interpretations and assessments or other developments that may occur during the review process , or even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing , a product ’s commercial potential could be adversely affected by potential emerging concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting the scope of indicated patient populations , labeling or marketing , manufacturing processes , safety issues and/or other matters , including decisions relating to emerging developments regarding potential product impurities . also , certain of our products have received and may in the future receive approvals under accelerated approval pathways where continued approval may be contingent upon confirmatory studies demonstrating the anticipated clinical benefit and/or safety profile . we may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees , such as the acip or an fda advisory committee , which may impact the availability or commercial potential of our products and product candidates . further , claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and/or efficacy of in - line products and product candidates can negatively impact current or future product sales , as applicable , and potentially lead to product recalls or withdrawals , including regulator - directed risk evaluations and assessments , and/or consumer fraud , product liability and other litigation and claims . regulatory requirements may also result in a more challenging , expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for , among other things , additional or more extensive clinical trials prior # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end to granting approval , or increased post - approval requirements . for these and other reasons discussed in this risk factors section , we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate , or at all . post - authorization / approval data as a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product , the fda may require , or the sponsor may voluntarily agree to undertake , post - marketing commitments such as additional clinical trials or other studies . the results generated in these trials have in the past impacted certain of our products and could impact our products in the future , such as by resulting in the loss of marketing approval , changes in labeling , and/or new or increased concerns about safety and/or efficacy , including newly discovered adverse events . regulatory agencies in countries outside the u.s . often have similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements , although there are differences between the u.s . , the eu and other international regulatory requirements , which may contribute to inconsistency or uncertainty in the marketability of our products across different jurisdictions . post - marketing studies and clinical trials , whether conducted by us or by others , whether mandated by regulatory agencies or conducted voluntarily , and other emerging data about products , such as adverse event reports , may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products . further , if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as one of our products , those concerns could implicate the entire class ; and this , in turn , could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s ) as well as other products in the class . the potential regulatory and commercial implications of post - marketing study results typically can not immediately be determined . the terms of our eua for comirnaty require that we conduct post - observational studies to evaluate the association between the pfizer - biontech covid-19 vaccine ( original monovalent ) , pfizer - biontech covid-19 vaccine , bivalent , and the pfizer - biontech covid-19 vaccine ( [XXXX] - [XXXX] formula ) , and a pre - specified list of adverse events of special interest , including myocarditis and pericarditis , along with deaths and hospitalizations , and severe covid-19 . the required study populations include individuals specified in our september [XXXX] authorization letter ( reissued ) as well as populations of interest , such as healthcare workers , pregnant women , immunocompromised individuals and subpopulations with specific comorbidities . additionally , in relation to the fda approval for comirnaty , we are required to complete certain postmarketing study requirements and commitments through [XXXX] and beyond . in the fda ’s revision to the eua for paxlovid , the fda removed the post - authorization requirements as they were addressed as a post - marketing commitment associated with the approval of the paxlovid nda . the terms of our paxlovid eua had previously required monitoring of a genomic database(s ) for the emergence of global viral variants of sars - cov-2 and providing reports to the fda on a monthly basis summarizing any findings . also , the fda required pfizer to assess the activity of the authorized paxlovid against any global sars - cov-2 variant(s ) of interest and complete certain other analyses and studies as identified in our october [XXXX] eua . legal matters we are and may be involved in various legal proceedings , including patent litigation , product liability and other product - related litigation , including personal injury , consumer , off - label promotion , securities , antitrust and breach of contract claims , commercial and other asserted and unasserted matters , environmental , government and tax investigations , employment , tax litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business . litigation is inherently unpredictable , and excessive verdicts do occur . although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial , we have in the past and could in the future incur judgments , enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters , and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations . claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes . there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters , and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue , which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations . we are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business . there continues to be a significant volume of government investigations and litigation against companies operating in our industry , both in the u.s . and around the world . government investigations and actions have and could result in substantial criminal and civil fines and/or criminal charges , limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions , corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions , as well as reputational harm , including as a result of increased public interest in the matter . in addition , in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene , the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government . our sales and marketing activities , the pricing of our products and other aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca , the medicaid drug rebate program , the fcpa and other federal and state statutes , including those discussed elsewhere in this form [XX] - k , as well as the anti - kickback statute , anti - bribery laws , the false claims act , and similar laws in international jurisdictions . in addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws , the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation , settlement precedent , advisory opinions , and special fraud alerts . our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments . requirements or industry standards in the u.s . and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions . if an interaction is found to be improper , government enforcement actions and penalties could result . like many companies in our industry , we have from time - to - time received , and may receive in the future , inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities . in addition , we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities , brought by governmental authorities , as well as consumers and private payors . in some instances , we have incurred significant expense , civil payments , fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims , actions and inquiries . such claims , actions and inquiries may relate to alleged non - compliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product ( approved and unapproved ) information , potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage . this risk may be heightened by digital marketing , including social media , mobile applications and blogger outreach . in connection with the resolution of a u.s . government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to medicare patients , in [XXXX] , we entered into a corporate integrity agreement ( cia ) with the office of the inspector general of the hhs ( oig ) , which expired in may [XXXX] . pfizer submitted its final annual report and is awaiting a response from the oig . we and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claims and proceedings , including environmental contingencies . amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions . while we have accrued for # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end worldwide legal liabilities , no guarantee exists that additional costs will not be incurred or additional payments will not be required beyond the amounts accrued . for additional information , including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in , see note 16a . risks related to intellectual property , technology and security : intellectual property protection our success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products . we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property , including patent , trademark , trade dress , copyright , trade secret and domain name protection laws , as well as confidentiality and license agreements , to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights . if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection , we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products , from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours . our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis . similarly , any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis , if at all , and any term adjustments related to patent office delays in obtaining a patent may be reduced or eliminated entirely due to risks associated with changes in law relating to patent terms . in addition , our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against claims regarding validity , enforceability , scope and effective term made by parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage , including exclusivity in a particular product area . further , legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governments could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing intellectual property related to our products . the wto continues to address the role of intellectual property in the context of the covid-19 response . this includes the june [XXXX] ministerial decision on the agreement on trade - related aspects of intellectual property rights , which seeks to make it easier for certain wto members to issue a compulsory license on covid-19 vaccines , and discussions continue on whether to expand that decision to covid-19 therapeutics and diagnostics . the scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries , as individual countries have distinct patent laws , and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country , its enforcement practices , and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country ’s intellectual property framework ( e.g. , laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license ) . in countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity , mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity , and generic companies are employing aggressive strategies , such as “ at - risk ” launches that challenge our patent rights . most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products , uses , processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer . independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of , or attempts to enforce , patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws . such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents . we are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers , payors , governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry . we also are often involved in other proceedings , such as inter partes review , post - grant review , re - examination or opposition proceedings , before the u.s . patent and trademark office , the european patent office , or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others . also , if one of our patents or a competitors ’ patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings , generic or biosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products . for additional information , including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved , see note 16a1 . further , if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property , our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected . we currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions , any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third - party objection , which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark . as our products mature , our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and , as a result , our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting , registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe , dilute or otherwise violate our rights . we seek to protect our proprietary information , including our trade secrets and proprietary know - how , by requiring our employees , consultants , other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us . despite these efforts and precautions , we may be unable to prevent a third - party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization , and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use . further , others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise . third - party intellectual property claims a properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model . we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies , but the patent granting process is imperfect . accordingly , the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly granted , including challenges through negotiation and litigation , and such challenges may not always be successful . part of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities , which may involve litigation , associated costs and time delays , and may ultimately not be successful . these opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid , or where products do not infringe the patents of others . in some circumstances we may take action , such as litigation , asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a “ first - to - market ” or early market position for our products . third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them . claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time - consuming to resolve , may delay or prevent product launches , and may result in significant royalty payments or damages or potential licensing agreements . for example , our r&d in a therapeutic area may not be first and another company or entity may have obtained relevant patents before us . we are involved in patent - related disputes with third parties over our attempts to market pharmaceutical products , including related to abrysvo , comirnaty and paxlovid . as we expand our mrna portfolio , patent - related disputes may increase . once we have final regulatory approval of the related products , we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings ( including any appeals ) have not been resolved ( i.e. , “ at - risk ” launch ) . if one of our marketed products ( or a product of our # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end collaboration / licensing partners to which we have licenses or co - promotion rights ) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party , such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments , or we may be prevented from further sales of that product . such damages may be enhanced as much as three - fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party . information technology and security significant disruptions of it systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business . we extensively rely upon sophisticated it systems ( including cloud services ) to operate our business . we produce , collect , process , store and transmit large amounts of confidential information ( including personal information and intellectual property ) , and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality , integrity and availability of such confidential information . we develop and operate digital systems to engage patients , healthcare providers , governments , payors and supply chain partners to conduct business and deliver medicines , digital diagnostics , clinical trials and digital therapies . such systems include mobile applications , wearable devices , internet websites and other digital technologies that may be targets of attack . we have outsourced significant elements of our operations , including significant elements of our it infrastructure and , as a result , we manage relationships with many third - party providers who may or could have access to our confidential information . we rely on technology developed , supplied and/or maintained by third - parties that may make us vulnerable to “ supply chain ” style cyber - attacks . further , technology and security vulnerabilities of acquisitions , business partners or third - party providers may not be identified during due diligence or soon enough to mitigate exploitation . the size and complexity of our it and information security systems , and those of our third - party providers ( and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them ) , make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by , but not limited to , our employees , contingent workers , service providers , business partners , customers or malicious attackers . as a global pharmaceutical company , our systems and assets are the target of frequent cyber - attacks . such cyber - attacks are of ever - increasing levels of sophistication , including the use of adversarial artificial intelligence techniques , and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives ( including , but not limited to , industrial espionage , extortion , property destruction and personal information theft ) and expertise , including , but not limited to , organized criminal groups , “ hacktivists , ” nation states , employees , business partners and others . due to the nature of some of these attacks , there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time . while we have invested in the protection of data and it and develop and maintain systems and controls , our efforts , like those of other similar companies , have not always and may not in the future prevent service interruptions , extortion , theft of confidential , personal or proprietary information , compromise of data integrity or unauthorized information disclosure . any technology service interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of personal data , confidential information or intellectual property . such incidents could require disclosure to government authorities and/or regulators and could require notification to impacted individuals and any incident could result in financial , legal , business and reputational harm to us . we maintain cyber liability insurance ; however , this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial , legal , business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems . artificial intelligence - based software is increasingly being used in the biopharmaceutical and global healthcare industries . as with many developing technologies , artificial intelligence - based software presents risks and challenges . for example , algorithms may be flawed ; data sets may be insufficient , of poor quality , or contain biased information ; and inappropriate or controversial data practices by data scientists , engineers , and end - users could impair results . if the analyses that artificial intelligence - based applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate , we could be subjected to competitive harm , potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm . furthermore , use of artificial intelligence - based software may lead to the release of confidential information which may impact our ability to realize the benefits of our intellectual property . general risks business development activities and strategic goals we have established significant growth goals , which we plan to achieve , in part , by not only advancing our own product pipelines and maximizing the value of our existing products , but also through various forms of business development activities , which can include alliances , licenses , jvs , collaborations , equity- or debt - based investments , dispositions , divestments , mergers and acquisitions . our recent acquisition of seagen is part of that growth plan . we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities . the success of our business development activities is dependent on the availability and accurate evaluation of appropriate opportunities , competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify , structure and execute transactions , including the ability to satisfy closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes or at all , and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and develop and commercialize acquired products . pursuing , executing and consummating these transactions may require substantial investment , which may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing , which has in the past and could in the future result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings and could limit our ability to obtain future financing . we have incurred substantial indebtedness to fund our recent acquisition of seagen . we financed a portion of the transaction with the proceeds from the $ [XX] billion of long - term debt issued in may [XXXX] , plus $ [X] billion in additional short - term indebtedness issued prior to the acquisition . the amount of debt that we have incurred could have significant consequences including , among other things , reducing our operating or financial flexibility , requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business . to the extent we incur additional indebtedness or interest rates increase , these risks could increase further . the success of our business development transactions , including our recent acquisition of seagen , depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties , many of which are outside of our control . unsuccessful clinical trials , regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges , among other factors , may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from business development transactions , including from acquired products and businesses . we may fail to generate expected revenue growth for our existing products , product pipeline and contribution from these transactions or from acquired products or businesses or we may fail to achieve anticipated cost savings , such as those expected with respect to seagen , within expected time frames or at all , which may impact our ability to meet our growth objectives . in certain transactions , we may agree to provide certain transition services for an extended period of time , which may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business . similarly , the accretive impact anticipated from certain transactions may not be realized or may be delayed . integration of acquired products or businesses may result in the loss of key employees , the disruption of ongoing business , including third - party relationships , or inconsistencies in standards , controls , procedures and policies . further , while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities through , among other things , due diligence , we may be exposed to risks and liabilities as a result of business development transactions . there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors , or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position . # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end where we invest in or otherwise obtain debt or equity securities of third parties in connection with business development transactions , such as our ownership interest in haleon , we may be unable to direct or influence the management , operational decisions and policies of such companies and the value of the acquired securities will fluctuate and may lose value . any future distribution or sale of such securities will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors , including the size of our ownership stake , at the time of such distribution or sale and there is no assurance as to the price that such securities will ultimately be sold or that such securities will be sold at all . pandemics pandemics , such as the covid-19 pandemic , have impacted and may in the future impact our business , operations and financial condition and results . related risks and challenges for our business include , among others : uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of a pandemic ; impacts to business operations ; decreased demand for certain of our products ; increased costs of doing business ; manufacturing disruptions and delays ; supply chain disruptions and shortages , including challenges related to reliance on third - party suppliers resulting in reduced availability of materials or components used in the development , manufacturing , distribution or administration of our products ; evolving macroeconomic factors and conditions , including general economic uncertainty , unemployment rates and recessionary pressures ; changes in labor markets , including challenges related to our human capital and talent development ; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to any potential pandemic response ; increased difficulty and uncertainty regarding predicting or estimating future performance ; pace of post - pandemic recovery , disruption and volatility within the financial or credit markets ; and our financial performance in general . covid-19 the extent to which covid-19 impacts our business going forward will depend on many factors , and we have made certain assumptions regarding covid-19 for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections , including assumptions regarding the global macroeconomic impact of covid-19 , as well as the demand , revenues , supply , contracts , market share and commercial markets for our current or future covid-19 products , which remain dynamic . despite careful tracking and planning , we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of covid-19 or our covid-19 products on our business , operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments . covid-19 or our covid-19 products may also affect our business , operations or financial condition and results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks . we also face risks and uncertainties related to our efforts to develop and commercialize our covid-19 products , as well as challenges related to their manufacturing , supply and distribution , including , among others : • the risk that as the market for covid-19 products becomes more endemic and seasonal , demand for any of our covid-19 products has and may continue to be reduced or not meet expectations , or may no longer exist , which has and may continue to lead to reduced revenues , excess inventory on - hand and/or in the channel which , for paxlovid and comirnaty , has resulted in significant inventory write - offs in [XXXX] and could continue to result in inventory write - offs or other unanticipated charges ; • challenges related to the transition to the commercial market for our covid-19 products ; • uncertainties related to the public ’s demand for vaccines , boosters and covid-19 treatments ; • risks related to our ability to accurately forecast and achieve our revenue forecasts for comirnaty and paxlovid or any potential future covid-19 vaccines or treatments ; • uncertainties inherent in r&d , including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints , commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials , regulatory submission dates , regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates , as well as risks associated with pre - clinical and clinical data ( including phase 1/2/3 or phase [X] data for comirnaty or any vaccine candidate in the bnt162 program or paxlovid or any future covid-19 treatment ) in any of our studies in pediatrics , adolescents or adults or real world evidence , including the possibility of unfavorable new pre - clinical , clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing pre - clinical , clinical or safety data or further information regarding the quality of pre - clinical , clinical or safety data , including by audit or inspection ; • the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results for comirnaty , any vaccine candidate or other vaccines that may result from the bnt162 program , paxlovid or any future covid-19 treatment or any other covid-19 program , including the rate of effectiveness and/or efficacy , safety and tolerability profile observed to date , in additional analyses of the phase [X] trial for any such products and additional studies , in real - world data studies or in larger , more diverse populations following commercialization ; • the ability of comirnaty or any future vaccine to prevent , or paxlovid or any future covid-19 treatment to be effective against , covid-19 caused by emerging virus variants ; • the risk that use of comirnaty or paxlovid will lead to new information about efficacy , safety or other developments , including the risk of additional adverse reactions , some of which may be serious ; • the risk that pre - clinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments , including during the peer review / publication process , in the scientific community generally , and by regulatory authorities ; • whether and when additional data from the bnt162 program , paxlovid or other covid-19 programs will be published in scientific journal publications and , if so , when and with what modifications and interpretations ; • whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from existing or future pre - clinical and clinical studies ; • whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for comirnaty or any future vaccines in additional populations , for a potential booster dose for comirnaty , or any potential future vaccine or vaccine candidates ( including potential future annual boosters or re - vaccinations ) , and/or biologics license and/or eua applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for comirnaty or any other potential vaccine or vaccine candidates , and if obtained , whether or when such eua or licenses , or existing euas , will expire or terminate ; • whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for paxlovid or any future covid-19 treatment and/or any drug applications and/or eua applications or amendments to any such applications for any indication for paxlovid or any future covid-19 treatment may be filed in particular jurisdictions , and if obtained , whether or when such eua or licenses , or existing euas , will expire or terminate ; • whether and when any application that may be pending or filed for comirnaty , any vaccine candidate or other vaccines that may result from the bnt162 program , paxlovid or any future covid-19 treatment or any other covid-19 program may be approved by particular regulatory # # table_start pfizer inc . [XXXX] form [XX] - k # # table_end authorities , which will depend on myriad factors , including making a determination as to whether the vaccine ’s or drug ’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine ’s or drug ’s efficacy and , if approved , whether it will be commercially successful ; • decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing , manufacturing processes , safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of any vaccine or drug , including the authorization or approval of products or therapies developed by other companies ; • disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners , clinical trial sites or third - party suppliers , including our relationship with biontech ; • the risk that other companies may produce competitive products that may be superior in terms of efficacy , safety , affordability , convenience , or a number of other competitive factors ; • risks related to the availability or cost of raw materials to manufacture or test any such products ; • challenges related to our vaccine ’s formulation and attendant storage , distribution and administration requirements , including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by us ; • challenges and risks related to medication errors such as prescribing or dispensing the wrong strength , improper dosing and self - administration errors ; • the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations , booster doses or potential future vaccines , potential combination respiratory vaccines or next generation covid-19 treatments ; • the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our r&d and manufacturing efforts ; • risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide research funding for the bnt162 program , paxlovid or any other covid-19 program ; • challenges and risks associated with the pace of our development programs ; • the risk that we may not be able to maintain manufacturing capacity or access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our covid-19 products , which would negatively impact our ability to supply our covid-19 products within the projected time periods ; • whether and when additional supply or purchase agreements will be reached or existing agreements will be modified ; • uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine or treatment advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations ; • pricing and access challenges for such products ; • challenges related to public confidence in , or awareness of comirnaty , paxlovid or any future covid-19 product candidates , including challenges driven by misinformation or disinformation , access , concerns about clinical data integrity , or prescriber and pharmacy education ; • trade restrictions ; and • the risk that we may owe third - party royalties or other adverse outcomes from existing litigation related to comirnaty and paxlovid , or have additional other claims asserted related to comirnaty or paxlovid . certain of these risks and uncertainties also apply to our covid-19 and influenza diagnostic tests . climate change and sustainability pfizer is subject to transitional and physical risks related to climate change . transitional risks include , for example , a disorderly global transition away from fossil fuels that may result in increased energy prices ; customer preference for low or no - carbon products ; stakeholder pressure to decarbonize assets ; or new legal or regulatory requirements that result in new or expanded carbon pricing , taxes , restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions , and increased greenhouse gas disclosure and transparency . these risks could increase operating costs , including the cost of our electricity and energy use , or otherwise increase compliance costs . physical risks to our operations include water stress and drought ; flooding and storm surge ; wildfires ; extreme temperatures and storms , which could impact pharmaceutical production , increase costs , or disrupt supply chains of medicines for patients . for example , our manufacturing facility in rocky mount , nc was damaged by a tornado in july [XXXX] . while manufacturing has resumed , the supply of medicines impacted by the tornado is expected to be affected through [XXXX] . for additional details on the impact of the tornado in rocky mount , nc , see the overview of our performance , operating environment , strategy and outlook — our operating environment section within md&a . our supply chain is subject to these same transitional and physical risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to us . in june [XXXX] , pfizer established our fourth consecutive greenhouse gas reduction goal with new near- and long - term targets to achieve the science based target initiative ’s voluntary net - zero standard by [XXXX] . while we are working to develop and implement emission reduction plans to achieve our voluntary climate goals , various factors , including the long time horizons and commercial availability of new technologies to enable the emission reductions , in the time and scale needed , may present inherent risk in our ability to meet these goals . additionally , success may depend on the actions of governments and third parties and may require , among other things , significant capital investment ; r&d ; and government policies and incentives to foster innovation and reduce costs of technologies that may not currently exist or be available at scale . governmental authorities , non - governmental organizations , customers , investors , employees , and other stakeholders are increasingly sensitive to esg matters , such as equitable access to medicines and vaccines , product quality and safety , diversity , equity and inclusion , environmental stewardship , support for local communities , value chain environmental and social due diligence , corporate governance and transparency , and addressing human capital factors in our operations . in addition , governments and the public expect companies like us to report on our business practices with respect to human rights , responsible sourcing and environmental impact , as well as the actions of our third - party contractors and suppliers around the world . this focus on esg matters may lead to new expectations or requirements that could result in increased costs associated with research , development , manufacture , or distribution of our products . our ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements , such as growing demand for companies to establish validated net zero targets or offer more sustainable products . while we strive to improve our esg performance and meet our voluntary goals , if we do not meet , or are perceived not to meet , our goals or other stakeholder expectations in key esg areas , we risk negative stakeholder reaction , including from proxy advisory services , as well as damage to our brand and reputation , reduced demand for our products or other negative impacts on our business and operations . while we monitor a broad range of esg matters , we can not be certain that we will manage such matters successfully , or that we will successfully meet the expectations of investors , employees , consumers , governments and other stakeholders . # # table_start pfizer inc .

term contracted assets throughout the u.s . and canada , primarily consisting of clean energy assets , such as renewable generation facilities , and electric transmission facilities , as well as providing other clean energy solutions to its customers . in january [XXXX] , nee acquired gulf power company , a rate - regulated electric utility engaged in the generation , transmission , distribution and sale of electric energy in northwest florida . on january [X] , [XXXX] , fpl and gulf power company merged , with fpl as the surviving entity . however , during [XXXX] , fpl continued to be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities in the former service areas of fpl and gulf power company . effective january [X] , [XXXX] , fpl became regulated as one electric ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs ( see fpl – fpl regulation – fpl electric rate regulation – base rates – base rates effective january [XXXX] through december [XXXX] ) . as described in more detail in the following sections , nee seeks to create value in its two principal businesses by meeting its customers ' needs more economically and more reliably than its competitors . nee 's strategy has resulted in profitable growth over sustained periods at both fpl and neer . management seeks to grow each business ( see note [XX] – commitments ) in a manner consistent with the varying opportunities available to it ; however , management believes that the diversification and balance represented by fpl and neer is a valuable characteristic of the enterprise and recognizes that each business contributes to nee 's financial strength in different ways . fpl and neer share a common platform with the objective of lowering costs , creating efficiencies and encouraging innovative ideas for their businesses . nee and its subsidiaries , with employees totaling approximately [XX,XXX] as of december [XX] , [XXXX] , continue to develop and implement enterprise - wide initiatives focused on improving productivity , process effectiveness and quality . on august [XX] , [XXXX] , the inflation reduction act ( ira ) was signed into law which , among other things , extends the period for wind and solar tax credits , expands the tax credits to support a broader range of renewable technologies and allows renewable energy tax credits to be transferred . see neer – clean energy and other operations – clean energy – policy incentives for renewable energy projects . nee believes the ira provides long - term visibility and supports the growth of its businesses . nee 's reportable segments for financial reporting purposes are fpl and neer ( see note [XX] ) . neech , a wholly owned subsidiary of nee , owns and provides funding for nee 's operating subsidiaries , other than fpl and its subsidiaries . nep , an affiliate of nextera energy resources , acquires , manages and owns contracted clean energy assets with stable , long - term cash flows . see neer section below for further discussion of nep . the following diagram depicts nee 's simplified ownership structure : s fpl fpl is a rate - regulated electric utility engaged primarily in the generation , transmission , distribution and sale of electric energy in florida . fpl is the largest electric utility in the state of florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the u.s . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , fpl had [XX,XXX] mw of net generating capacity , approximately [XX,XXX] circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines and [XXX] substations . fpl provides service to its electric customers through an integrated transmission and distribution system that links its generation facilities to its customers . fpl serves more than [XX] million people through approximately [X.X] million customer accounts . the following map shows fpl 's service areas and plant locations as of february [XX] , [XXXX] , which cover most of the east and lower west coasts of florida and are in ten counties throughout northwest florida ( see fpl sources of generation below ) . s customers and revenue fpl 's primary source of operating revenues is from its retail customer base ; it also serves a limited number of wholesale customers within florida . the percentage of fpl 's operating revenues and customer accounts by customer class were as follows : # # table_start # # table_end for both retail and wholesale customers , the prices ( or rates ) that fpl may charge are approved by regulatory bodies , by the fpsc in the case of retail customers and by the ferc in the case of wholesale customers . in general , under u.s . and florida law , regulated rates are intended to cover the cost of providing service , including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital . since the regulatory bodies have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed , there can be no guarantee that fpl will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of its costs through regulated rates . see fpl regulation below . fpl seeks to maintain attractive rates for its customers . since rates are largely cost - based , maintaining low rates requires a strategy focused on developing and maintaining a low - cost position , including the implementation of ideas generated from cost savings initiatives . franchise agreements and competition fpl 's service to its electric retail customers is provided primarily under franchise agreements negotiated with municipalities or counties . during the term of a franchise agreement , which is typically [XX] years , the municipality or county agrees not to form its own utility , and fpl has the right to offer electric service to residents . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , fpl held [XXX] franchise agreements with various municipalities and counties in florida with varying expiration dates through [XXXX] . these franchise agreements cover the vast majority of fpl 's retail customer base in florida . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , fpl also provided service to customers in [XX] other municipalities and to [XX] unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements pursuant to the general obligation to serve as a public utility . fpl relies upon florida law for access to public rights of way . because any customer may elect to provide their own electric services , fpl effectively must compete for an individual customer 's business . as a practical matter , few customers provide their own service at the present time since fpl 's cost of service is lower than the cost of self - generation for a significant majority of customers . changing technology ( particularly increasing efficiency of solar power generation ) , tax incentives , economic conditions , regulatory changes , increasing cost - competitiveness of rooftop solar and batteries and other factors could alter the favorable relative cost position that fpl currently enjoys ; however , fpl seeks as a matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value , in the form of comparatively low customer bills , high reliability , outstanding customer service and clean energy . in addition to self - generation by residential , commercial and industrial customers , fpl also faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale and industrial customers and from alternative energy sources . in [XXXX] , [XXXX] and [XXXX] , operating revenues from wholesale and ind ustrial electric customers combined represented approximately [X] % , [X] % and [X] % , respectively , of fpl 's total operating revenues . for the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of [XX] mw or greater , the fpsc requires investor - owned electric utilities , including fpl , to issue a request for proposal ( rfp ) except when the fpsc determines that an exception from the rfp process is in the public interest . the rfp process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity . if a bidder has the most cost - effective alternative , meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed , the investor - owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a ppa with the selected bidder and request that the fpsc approve the terms of the ppa and , if appropriate , provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder 's generating capacity . s fpl sources of generation at december [XX] , [XXXX] , fpl 's resources for serving load consisted of approximately [XX,XXX] mw of net generating capacity , of which [XX,XXX] mw were from fpl - owned facilities and [XXX] mw were available through ppas . fpl owned and operated [XX] units with generating capacity of [XX,XXX] mw that primarily use natural gas and [XX] solar generation facilities with generating capacity totaling [X,XXX] mw . in addition , fpl owned , or had undivided interests in , and operated [X] nuclear units with net generating capacity totaling [X,XXX] mw ( see nuclear operations below ) and had joint ownership interests in [X] coal units located in mississippi and georgia it did not operate with net generating capacity totaling [XXX] mw . fpl retired its share of two coal units in mississippi in january [XXXX] and the remaining one in georgia is expected to be retired in [XXXX] . see note [X] – jointly - owned electric plants regarding the retirement of these plants . fpl also develops and constructs battery storage projects , which when combined with its solar projects , serve to enhance its ability to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation source . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , fpl had [XXX] mw of battery storage capacity that delivers energy to the transmission system . fpl customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months , largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in its service area . occasionally , unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short periods of time . through [XXXX] , fpl plans to add new solar generation with cost recovery through base rates , either through a solar base rate adjustment ( sobra ) or solartogether ® ( a voluntary community solar program that gives fpl electric customers an opportunity to participate directly in the expansion of solar energy where participants pay a fixed monthly subscription charge and receive credits on their related monthly customer bill ) . fpl placed [XXX] mw of solar generating capacity in service in january [XXXX] and is currently in the process of constructing an additional [X,XXX] mw and [XXX] mw of solar generating capacity , which is expected to be placed in service in [XXXX] and in [XXXX] , respectively ( see fpl regulation – fpl electric rate regulation – base rates – base rates effective january [XXXX] through december [XXXX] below ) . fuel sources fpl relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities , the ability of some of its generation facilities to operate on both natural gas and low sulfur diesel , and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix in order to respond to market and industry developments . see discussion of planned solar generation additions above . in [XXXX] , fpl placed a hydrogen facility in service that blends green hydrogen with natural gas at an existing natural gas generation facility . # # table_start * approximately [XX] % has dual fuel capability # # table_end significant fuel and transportation contracts . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , fpl had the following significant fuel and transportation contracts in place : • firm transportation contracts with ten different transportation suppliers for natural gas pipeline capacity for an aggregate maximum delivery quantity of [X,XXX,XXX] mmbtu / day with expiration dates through [XXXX] ( see note [XX] – contracts ) ; • several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion , enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates through [XXXX] ; and • short- and medium - term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of fpl 's anticipated needs for natural gas , s with the remainder of fpl 's natural gas requirements being purchased in the spot market . nuclear operations at december [XX] , [XXXX] , fpl owned , or had undivided interests in , and operated the four nuclear units in florida discussed below . fpl 's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages , including inspections , repairs and certain other modifications . scheduled nuclear refueling outages require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time . # # table_start facility net generating capacity ( mw ) beginning of next scheduled refueling outage operating license expiration date st . lucie unit no .

( c ) in [XXXX] , fpl filed a site - specific environmental impact statement with the nrc related to the previously approved [XX] - year renewal application for both turkey point operating licenses . approval of the additional [XX] years of operations is pending . nrc regulations require fpl to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation . if the license renewals are approved by the nrc , fpl 's plans provide for st . lucie unit no . [X] to be shut down in [XXXX] with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of st . lucie unit no . [X] commencing in [XXXX] . if the nrc approves an additional [XX] years of operations , fpl 's plans provide for the dismantlement of turkey point units nos . [X] and [X] with decommissioning activities commencing in [XXXX] and [XXXX] , respectively . fpl 's nuclear facilities use both on - site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities , which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through license expiration , as well as through any pending license extensions . fpl energy marketing and trading fpl 's energy marketing & trading division ( emt ) buys and sells wholesale energy commodities , such as natural gas , low sulfur diesel , electricity and renewable energy credits ( recs ) from certain fpl solar generation assets . emt procures natural gas and low sulfur diesel for fpl 's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas , low sulfur diesel and electricity . emt also uses derivative instruments ( primarily swaps , options and forwards ) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity . substantially all of the results of emt 's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses . see management 's discussion – energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity and note [X] . fpl regulation fpl 's operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal , state and other organizations , including , but not limited to , the following : • the fpsc , which has jurisdiction over retail rates , service area , issuances of securities , and planning , siting and construction of facilities , among other things ; • the ferc , which oversees the acquisition and disposition of electric generation , transmission and other facilities , transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce , proposals to build and operate interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities , and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy , among other things ; • the nerc , which , through its regional entities , establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards , subject to approval by the ferc , to ensure the reliability of the u.s . electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts ; • the nrc , which has jurisdiction over the operation of nuclear power plants through the issuance of operating licenses , rules , regulations and orders ; and • the epa , which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws , in some cases delegating authority to state agencies . the epa also works with industries and all levels of government , including federal and state governments , in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts . s fpl electric rate regulation the fpsc sets rates at a level that is intended to allow the utility the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues ( revenue requirements ) equal to its cost of providing service , including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital . to accomplish this , the fpsc uses various ratemaking mechanisms , including , among other things , base rates and cost recovery clauses . although fpl and gulf power company merged effective january [X] , [XXXX] , fpl continued to be regulated as two separate rate making entities until january [X] , [XXXX] when new unified rates and tariffs became effective for the combined utility system ( including the former gulf power company service area ) . see base rates effective january [XXXX] through december [XXXX] below . base rates . in general , the basic costs of providing electric service , other than fuel and certain other costs , are recovered through base rates , which are designed to recover the costs of constructing , operating and maintaining the utility system . these basic costs include o&m expenses , depreciation and taxes , as well as a return on investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service ( rate base ) . at the time base rates are established , the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the fpsc 's determination of the utility 's estimated weighted - average cost of capital , which includes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed return on common equity . the fpsc monitors the utility 's actual regulatory roe through a surveillance report that is filed monthly with the fpsc . the fpsc does not provide assurance that any regulatory roe will be achieved . base rates are determined in rate proceedings o r through negotiated settlements of those proceedings . proceedings can occur at the initiative of the utility or upon action by the fpsc . existing base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the fpsc . base rates effective january [XXXX] through december [XXXX] – in december [XXXX] , the fpsc issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between fpl and several intervenors in fpl 's base rate proceeding ( [XXXX] rate agreement ) . key elements of the [XXXX] rate agreement , which is effective from january [XXXX] through at least december [XXXX] , include , among other things , the following : • new retail base rates and charges were established for the combined utility system ( including the former gulf power company service area ) resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues : ◦ $ [XXX] million beginning january [X] , [XXXX] , and ◦ $ [XXX] million beginning january [X] , [XXXX] . • in addition , fpl is eligible to receive , subject to conditions specified in the [XXXX] rate agreement , base rate increases associated with the addition of up to [XXX] mw annually of new solar generation through the sobra mechanism in each of [XXXX] and [XXXX] , and may carry forward any unused mw in [XXXX] to [XXXX] . fpl has agreed to an installed cost cap of $ [X,XXX] per kw and will be required to demonstrate that these proposed solar facilities are cost effective . • fpl 's authorized regulatory roe was [XX.XX] % , with a range of [X.XX] % to [XX.XX] % . however , in the event the average [XX] - year u.s . treasury rate was [X.XX] % or greater over a consecutive six - month period , fpl was authorized to increase the regulatory roe to [XX.XX] % with a range of [X.XX] % to [XX.XX] % . during august [XXXX] , this provision was triggered and effective september [X] , [XXXX] , fpl 's authorized regulatory roe and roe range were increased . if fpl 's earned regulatory roe falls below [X.XX] % , fpl may seek retail base rate relief . if the earned regulatory roe rises above [XX.XX] % , any party with standing may seek a review of fpl 's retail base rates . • subject to certain conditions , fpl may amortize , over the term of the [XXXX] rate agreement , up to $ [X.XX] billion of depreciation reserve surplus , provided that in any year of the [XXXX] rate agreement fpl must amortize at least enough reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory roe and also may not amortize any reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory roe in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory roe . • fpl is authorized to expand solartogether ® by constructing an additional [X,XXX] mw of solar generation from [XXXX] through [XXXX] , such that the total capacity of solartogether ® would be [X,XXX] mw . • future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning [XX] days from the filing of a cost recovery petition , but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $ [X] for every [X,XXX] kwh of usage on residential bills during the first [XX] months of cost recovery . any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years . if storm restoration costs exceed $ [XXX] million in any given calendar year , fpl may request an increase to the $ [X] surcharge . see note [X] – storm funds , storm reserves and storm cost recovery . • if federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the [XXXX] rate agreement , fpl will prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the fpsc . as a result of the enactment of the ira ( see neer – clean energy and other operations – clean energy – policy incentives for renewable energy projects ) , fpl 's customers are expected to save approximately $ [XXX] million over the remaining term of the [XXXX] rate agreement which includes a $ [XX] million one - time refund made in january [XXXX] . on september [XX] , [XXXX] , the florida supreme court ruled on the appeal of the fpsc ’s final order regarding fpl ’s [XXXX] rate agreement by floridians against increased rates , inc . and , as a group , florida rising , inc . , environmental confederation of southwest florida , inc . and league of united latin american citizens of florida . the ruling remands the fpsc 's order back to the fpsc . while management is unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome , fpl believes the fpsc 's subsequent order will maintain its determination that the [XXXX] rate agreement is in the public interest and should remain intact . base rates effective january [XXXX] through december [XXXX] – from january [XXXX] to december [XXXX] , fpl operated under a base rate agreement ( [XXXX] rate agreement ) that provided for , among other things , a regulatory roe of [XX.XX] % , with a range of [X.XX] % to [XX.XX] % and , subject to certain conditions , the right to reduce depreciation expense up to $ [X.XX] billion ( reserve ) , s provided that in any year of the [XXXX] rate agreement fpl was required to amortize enough reserve to maintain an earned regulatory roe within the range of [X.XX] % to [XX.XX] % . cost recovery clauses . cost recovery clauses are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through these clauses . cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges per kwh or kw , depending on the customer 's rate class . these cost recovery clause charges are calculated annually based on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year , plus or minus true - up adjustments to reflect the estimated over or under recovery of costs for the current and prior periods . an adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect revised estimates . fpl recovers costs from customers through the following clauses : • fuel – primarily fuel costs , the most significant of the cost recovery clauses in terms of operating revenues ( see note [X] – rate regulation ) ; • storm protection plan – costs associated with an fpsc - approved transmission and distribution storm protection plan , which includes costs for hardening of overhead transmission and distribution lines , undergrounding of certain distribution lines and vegetation management ; • capacity – primarily certain costs associated with the acquisition of several electric generation facilities ( see note [X] – rate regulation ) and capacity payments related to ppas ; • energy conservatio n – costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs ; and • environmental – certain costs of complying with federal , state and local environmental regulations enacted after april [XXXX] and costs associated with certain of fpl 's solar facilities placed in service prior to [XXXX] . the fpsc has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred . these costs may include , among others , fuel and o&m expenses , the cost of replacing power lost when generation units are unavailable , storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities . ferc the federal power act grants the ferc exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce . pursuant to the federal power act , electric utilities must file for ferc acceptance and maintain tariffs and rate schedules which govern the rates , terms and conditions for the provision of ferc - jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services . wholesale power sales tariffs on file at ferc may authorize sales at cost - based rates or , where the seller lacks market power , at market - based rates . the federal power act also gives the ferc authority to certify and oversee an electric reliability organization with authority to establish and independently enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users , owners and operators of the bulk - power system . see nerc below . electric utilities are subject to accounting , record - keeping and reporting requirements administered by the ferc . the ferc also places certain limitations on transactions between electric utilities and their affiliates . nerc the nerc has been certified by the ferc as an electric reliability organization . the nerc 's mandate is to ensure the reliability and security of the north american bulk - power system through the establishment and enforcement of reliability standards approved by ferc . the nerc 's regional entities also enforce reliability standards approved by the ferc . fpl is subject to these reliability standards and incurs costs to ensure compliance with continually heightened requirements , and can incur significant penalties for failing to comply with them . fpl environmental regulation fpl is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the nee environmental matters section below . fpl expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations . fpl human capital fpl had approximately [X,XXX] employees at december [XX] , [XXXX] , with approximately [XX] % of these employees represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers ( ibew ) . the collective bargaining agreements have approximate ly two- to three - year terms and expire between april [XXXX] and january [XXXX] . s neer neer , comprised of nee 's competitive energy and rate - regulated transmission businesses , is a diversified clean energy business with a strategy that emphasizes the development , construction and operation of long - term contracted assets with a focus on clean energy . nee reports nextera energy resources and neet , a rate - regulated transmission business , on a combined basis for segment reporting purposes , and the combined segment is referred to as neer . the neer segment owns , develops , constructs , manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets in the u.s . a nd canada and also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus , such as battery storage and renewable fuels . neer , with appr oximately [XX,XXX] mw of total net generating capacity at december [XX] , [XXXX] , is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the u.s . , including approximately [XX,XXX] mw of net generating capacity across [XX] states and [XXX] mw of net generating capacity in [X] canadian provinces . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , neer operates facilities , in which it has partial or full ownership interests , with a total generating capacity of approximately [XX,XXX] mw . neer primarily sells its capacity and/or energy output through long - term power sales agreements with utilities , retail electricity providers , power cooperatives , municipal electric providers and commercial and industrial customers . neer produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable sources as described more fully below . in addition , neer develops and constructs battery storage projects , which when combined with its renewable projects , serve to enhance its ability to meet customers ' firm capacity needs , or as standalone facilities . neer is the world 's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on [XXXX] mwh produced on a net generation basis , as well as a world leader in battery storage . the neer segment also owns , develops , constructs and operates rate - regulated transmission facilities in north america . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , neer 's rate - regulated transmission facilities and the transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid are comprised of approximately [XXX] substations and [X,XXX] circuit miles of transmission lines . neer also engages in energy - related commodity marketing and trading activities , including entering into financial and physical contracts . these contracts primarily include power and fuel commodities and their related products for the purpose of providing full energy and capacity requirements services , primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets , and offering customized power and fuel and related risk management services to wholesale customers , as well as to hedge the production from neer 's generation assets that is not sold under long - term power supply agreements . in addition , neer participates in natural gas , natural gas liquids and oil production through operating and non - operating ownership interests , and in pipeline infrastructure construction , management and operations , through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests , hereafter referred to as the gas infrastructure business . neer also hedges the expected output from its gas infrastructure production assets to protect against price movements . nep – through nep opco , nep acquires , manages and owns contracted clean energy assets with stable long - term cash flows with a focus on renewable energy projects . nep 's assets include energy projects contributed by or acquired from nextera energy resources , or acquired from third parties , as well as ownership interests in a contracted natural gas pipeline acquired from third parties . nep also invests to repower or expand certain of its assets . nextera energy resources ' indirect limited partnership interest in nep opco based on the number of outstanding nep opco common units was approximately [XX.X] % at december [XX] , [XXXX] . nextera energy resources accounts for its ownership interest in nep as an equity method investment with its earnings / losses from nep as equity in earnings ( losses ) of equity method investees and accounts for its project sales to nep as third - party sales in its consolidated financial statements . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , nep owned , or had a partial ownership interest in , a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets consisting of wind , solar and battery storage projects with energy project capacity totaling approximately [XX,XXX] mw and a contracted natural gas pipeline all located in the u.s . as further discussed in clean energy and other operations . nextera energy resources operates essentially all of the energy projects in nep 's portfolio and its ownership interest in the portfolio 's capacity was approximately [X,XXX] mw at december [XX] , [XXXX] . clean energy and other operations neer sells products associated with its generation facilities ( energy , capacity , recs and ancillary services ) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located . customer transactions may be supplied from neer generation facilities or from purchases in the wholesale markets , or from a combination thereof . see markets and competition below . s neer 's generation and battery storage projects , natural gas pipelines and transmission facilities ( including noncontrolling or joint venture interests ) at december [XX] , [XXXX] are as follows : s clean energy # # table_start * primarily natural gas # # table_end generation assets neer 's portfolio of generation assets primarily consists of generation facilities with long -

rata basis by the joint owners with respect to the seabrook unit . nrc regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation . neer 's nuclear facilities use both on - site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities , which , based on existing regulations , are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through current license expiration , as well as through any pending license extensions . neer also maintains an approximately [XX] % interest in duane arnold , a nuclear facility located in iowa that ceased operations in august [XXXX] . neer submitted a site - specific cost estimate and plan for decontamination and decommissioning to the nrc . all spent nuclear fuel housed onsite is in long - term dry storage until the doe is able to take possession . neer estimates that the cost of decommissioning duane arnold is fully funded and expects completion by approximately [XXXX] . other clean energy neer 's portfolio also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus , such as battery storage and renewable fuels . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , nextera energy resources had net ownership interests in approximately [X,XXX] mw of battery storage capacity . in addition , nextera energy resources owns , or has a partial ownership interest in , a portfolio of [XX] biogas projects , one of which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas - to - electric facilities . policy incentives for renewable energy projects u.s . federal , state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects . these incentives include accelerated tax depreciation , ptcs , itcs , cash grants , tax abatements and rps programs . pursuant to the u.s . federal modified accelerated cost recovery system , wind and solar generation facilities are depreciated for tax purposes over a five - year period even though the useful life of such facilities is generally much longer than five years . owners of wind and solar facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit ( the ptc , or an itc in lieu of the ptc ) upon initially achieving commercial operation . this incentive was created under the energy policy act of [XXXX] and has been extended several times for wind ( the previous ptc for solar expired in [XXXX] ) . the ira expanded the ptc to include solar generation facilities and extended the [XXX] % ptc and the [XX] % itc to wind and solar generation facilities that start construction before the later of [XXXX] or the end of the calendar year following the year in which greenhouse gas emissions from u.s . electric generation are reduced by [XX] % from [XXXX] levels ( phaseout ) . accordingly , owners of wind and solar generation facilities placed in service in [XXXX] or later are eligible to claim a ptc ( or an itc in lieu of the ptc ) upon initially achieving commercial operation . the ptc is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the facility during the first ten years of commercial operation . alternatively , an itc equal to [XX] % of the cost of the facility may be claimed in lieu of the ptc . a facility must also meet certain labor requirements to qualify for the [XXX] % ptc or [XX] % itc rate or construction must have started on the facility before january [XX] , [XXXX] . in addition , the ptc is increased by [XX] % and the itc rate is increased by [XX] percentage points for facilities that satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements . retrofitted wind and solar generation facilities may qualify for a ptc or an itc if the cost basis of the new investment is at least [XX] % of the retrofitted facility ’s total fair value . in addition , the ira expanded the [XX] % itc to include storage projects placed in service after [XXXX] ( previously , such projects qualified only if they were connected to and charged by a renewable generation facility that claimed the itc ) as well as certain property with respect to renewable natural gas facilities that are placed in service after [XXXX] and begin construction before [XXXX] . the [XX] % itc to storage projects is subject to the phaseout . the ira created a ptc of $ [X] / kilogram of green ( low emission ) hydrogen produced at a facility after [XXXX] and during the first ten years of commercial operation ( or a [XX] % itc in lieu of the ptc ) , provided that construction of the facility begins before [XXXX] . these credits are also subject to certain other requirements . in addition , storage projects and hydrogen facilities claiming an itc are eligible for a [XX] percentage point increase in the itc rate if the facilities satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements . a wind or solar project that provides electricity to a green hydrogen facility may qualify for the ptc or itc and the hydrogen facility may separately qualify for its own ptc or itc . s for taxable years beginning after [XXXX] , renewable energy tax credits generated during the year can be transferred to an unrelated purchaser for cash , providing an additional path , along with sales of differential membership interests , for developers to monetize the value of renewable energy tax credits . other countries , including canada , provide for incentives like feed - in - tariffs for renewable energy projects . the feed - in - tariffs promote renewable energy investments by offering long - term contracts to renewable energy producers , typically based on the cost of generation of each technology . other operations gas infrastructure business – at december [XX] , [XXXX] , nextera energy resources had ownership interests in natural gas pipelines , the most significant of which are discussed below , and in oil and gas shale formations located primarily in the midwest and south regions of the u.s . # # table_start miles of pipeline pipeline location / route ownership total net capacity ( per day ) actual / expected in -

( b ) direct current ( c ) includes a substation , in which neet owns an [XX.X] % interest . customer supply – neer provides commodities - related products to customers , engages in energy - related commodity marketing and trading activities and includes the operations of a retail electricity provider . through nextera energy resources subsidiary pmi , neer : • manages risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices and optimizes the value of neer 's power generation and gas infrastructure production assets through the use of swaps , options , futures and forwards ; • sells output from neer 's plants that is not sold under long - term contracts and procures fuel for use by neer 's generation fleet ; • provides full energy and capacity requirements to customers ; and • markets and trades energy - related commodity products , including power and fuel , as well as marketing and trading services to customers . s markets and competition electricity markets in the u.s . and canada are regional and diverse in character . all are extensively regulated , and competition in these markets is shaped and constrained by regulation . the nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of regulation in each region . generally , in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition , neer may also face specific constraints in the form of price caps , or maximum allowed prices , for certain products . neer 's ability to sell the output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity , which can vary from time to time and can have a significant impact on pricing . the degree and nature of competition is different in wholesale markets than in retail markets . a majority of neer 's revenues are derived from sales of energy , capacity , credits and ancillary products under long - term ppas to customers located in wholesale electricity markets . wholesale power generation is a capital - intensive , commodity - driven business with numerous industry participants . neer primarily competes on the basis of price , but believes the green attributes of neer 's generation assets , its track record of completing projects on schedule , its creditworthiness and its ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages . wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure . as such , there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities , resources , nature and identity of the companies neer competes with depending on the market . in wholesale markets , customers ' needs are met through a variety of means , including long - term bilateral contracts , standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services . in general , u.s . and canadian electricity markets encompass three classes of services : energy and related energy credits , capacity and ancillary services . energy services relate to the physical delivery of power ; capacity services relate to the availability of mw capacity of a power generation asset ; and ancillary services are other services that relate to power generation assets , such as load regulation and spinning and non - spinning reserves . the exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs . not all regions have a capacity services class , and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region . rtos and isos exist throughout much of north america to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas and to run markets . neer operates in all rto and iso jurisdictions . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , neer also had generation facilities with a total net generating capacity of approximately [X,XXX] mw that fall within reliability regions that are not under the jurisdiction of an established rto or iso , including [X,XXX] mw within the western electricity coordinating council and [X,XXX] mw within the serc reliability corporation . although each rto and iso may have differing objectives and structures , some benefits of these entities include regional planning , managing transmission congestion , developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity , maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers . s neer has operations that fall within the following rtos and isos : neer competes in different regions to differing degrees , but in general it seeks to enter into long - term bilateral contracts for the full output of its generation facilities . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , approximately [XX] % of neer 's net generating capacity was committed under long - term contracts . where long - term contracts are not in effect , neer sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets . in such cases , neer will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts , typically of less than three years duration , to hedge the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market . such bilateral contracts , which may be hedges either for physical delivery or for financial ( pricing ) offset , serve to protect a portion of the revenue that neer expects to derive from the associated generation facility . contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation facility but are not recorded as hedges under gaap are referred to as “ non - qualifying hedges ” for adjusted earnings purposes . see management 's discussion – overview – adjusted earnings . certain facilities within the neer wind and solar generation portfolio produce recs and other environmental attributes which are typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long - term contracts , or may be sold separately from wind and solar generation not sold under long - term contracts . the purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the environmental attributes . while the majority of neer 's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities , neer is also an active competitor in several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel products and services to a variety of customers . in the full requirements service , typically , the supplier agrees to meet the customer 's needs for a full range of products for every hour of the day , at a fixed price , for a predetermined period of time , thereby assuming the risk of fluctuations in the customer 's volume requirements . expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for neer . opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities that can sell power in competitive markets . neer seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location , as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities . s neer regulation the energy markets in which neer operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation , as the case may be , including local , state and federal regulation , and other specific rules . at december [XX] , [XXXX] , essentially all of neer 's generation facilities located in the u.s . have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the public utility holding company act of [XXXX] . exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers . they are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers . while projects with exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions , each project must still comply with other federal , state and local laws , including , but not limited to , those regarding siting , construction , operation , licensing , pollution abatement and other environmental laws . additionally , most of the neer facilities located in the u.s . are subject to ferc regulations and market rules and the nerc 's mandatory reliability standards , all of its facilities are subject to environmental laws and the epa 's environmental regulations , and its nuclear facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc . see fpl – fpl regulation for additional discussion of ferc , nerc , nrc and epa regulations . rates of neer 's rate - regulated transmission businesses are set by regulatory bodies as noted in clean energy and other operations – other operations – rate - regulated transmission . with the exception of facilities located in ercot , the ferc has jurisdiction over various aspects of neer 's business in the u.s . , including the oversight and investigation of competitive wholesale energy markets , regulation of the transmission and sale of natural gas , and oversight of environmental matters related to natural gas projects and major electricity policy initiatives . the puct has jurisdiction , including the regulation of rates and services , oversight of competitive markets , and enforcement of statutes and rules , over neer facilities located in ercot . certain entities within the neer segment and their affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in canada related to energy operations , energy markets and environmental standards . in canada , activities related to owning and operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level . in ontario , for example , electric generation facilities must be licensed by the oeb and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the ieso , in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the nerc . in addition , neer is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the nee environmental matters section below . in order to better anticipate potential regulatory changes , neer continues to actively evaluate and participate in regional market redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy commodities . neer human capital neer had approximately [X,XXX] employees at december [XX] , [XXXX] . neer has collective bargaining agreements with the ibew , the utility workers union of amer ica and the security police and fire professionals of america , which collectively repr esent approximately [X] % of neer 's employees . the collective bargaining agreements have approximately two- to four - year terms and expire between june [XXXX] and december [XXXX] . nee environmental matters nee and its subsidiaries , including fpl , are subject to environmental laws and regulations , including extensive federal , state and local environmental statutes , rules and regulations relating to , among others , air quality , water quality and usage , waste management , wildlife protection and historical resources , for the siting , construction and ongoing operations of their facilities . the u.s . government and certain states and regions , as well as the government of canada and its provinces , have taken and continue to take certain actions , such as proposing and finalizing regulations or setting targets or goals , regarding the regulation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation . on may [XX] , [XXXX] , the epa published a proposed rule that would restrict carbon emissions for both new and existing fossil power plants that meet specific criteria . fpl expects any costs to comply with the final rule , if enacted , to qualify for recovery under the environmental clause , subject to fpsc approval . the environmental laws in the u.s . , including , among others , the endangered species act ( esa ) , the migratory bird treaty act , and the bald and golden eagle protection act ( bgepa ) , provide for the protection of numerous species , including endangered species and/or their habitats , migratory birds , bats and eagles . in [XXXX] , the u.s . fish and wildlife service listed the northern long - eared bat as endangered , with two more species expected to be listed in [XXXX] and [XXXX] . the environmental laws in canada , including , among others , the species at risk act , provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are endangered or threatened and the management of species of special concern . complying with these environmental laws and regulations could result in , among other things , changes in the design and operation of , and additional costs associated with , existing facilities and changes or delays in the location , design , construction and operation of new facilities . failure to comply could result in fines , penalties , criminal sanctions or injunctions . nee 's rate - regulated subsidiaries expect to seek recovery for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations , which recovery for fpl would be through the environmental clause . s website access to sec filings nee and fpl make their sec filings , including the annual report on form [XX] -

and fpl 's business the business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects of nee and fpl are subject to a variety of risks , many of which are beyond the control of nee and fpl . these risks , whether or not expressly stated with respect to any particular risk factor , as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or that are currently believed to not be material to the business , may materially adversely affect the business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects of nee and fpl and may cause actual results of nee and fpl to differ substantially from those that nee or fpl currently expects or seeks . in that event , the market price for the securities of nee or fpl could decline . accordingly , the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future reports that nee and fpl file with the sec . regulatory , legislative and legal risks nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their business . the operations of nee and fpl are subject to complex and comprehensive federal , state and other regulation . this extensive regulatory framework , portions of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors , regulates , among other things and to varying degrees , nee 's and fpl 's industry , businesses , operations , and rates and cost structures , including : permitting , planning , construction and operation of electric generation , storage , transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas , oil and other fuel production , transportation , processing and storage facilities ; acquisitions , disposals , depreciation and amortization of facilities and other assets ; decommissioning costs and funding ; service reliability ; wholesale and retail competition ; and commodities trading and derivatives transactions . in their business planning and in the management of their operations , nee and fpl must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a material adverse effect on their business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if they are unable to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs , a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates , cost recovery clauses , other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise . fpl operates as an electric utility and is subject to the jurisdiction of the fpsc over a wide range of business activities , including , among other items , the retail rates charged to its customers through base rates and cost recovery clauses , the terms and conditions of its services , procurement of electricity for its customers and fuel for its plant operations , issuances of securities , and aspects of the siting , planning , construction and operation of its generation plants and transmission and distribution systems for the sale of electric energy . the fpsc has the authority to disallow recovery by fpl of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred , including those incurred to transition to lower carbon emission technology , and to determine the level of return that fpl is permitted to earn on invested capital . the regulatory process , which may be adversely affected by the geopolitical , political , regulatory , operational and economic environment in florida and elsewhere , limits or could otherwise adversely impact fpl 's earnings . the regulatory process also does not provide any assurance as to achievement of authorized or other earnings levels , or that fpl will be permitted to earn an acceptable return on capital investments it wishes to make . nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if any material amount of costs , a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital can not be recovered through base rates , cost recovery clauses , other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise . certain other subsidiaries of nee are utilities subject to the jurisdiction of their regulators and are subject to similar risks . regulatory decisions that are important to nee and fpl may be materially adversely affected by political , regulatory , operational and economic factors . the local and national political , regulatory and economic environment has had , and may in the future have , an adverse effect on regulatory decisions with negative consequences for nee and fpl . these decisions , which may come from any level of government , may require , for example , fpl or neer to cancel or delay planned development activities , to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures or to pay for investments or otherwise incur costs that it may not be able to recover through rates or otherwise , each of which could have a material adverse effect on the business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects of nee and fpl . any reductions or modifications to , or the elimination of , governmental incentives or policies that support utility scale renewable energy , including , but not limited to , tax laws , policies and incentives , rps and feed - in - tariffs , or the imposition of additional taxes , tariffs , duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it , could result in , among other items , the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects , nee and fpl abandoning the development of renewable energy projects , a loss of investments in renewable energy projects and reduced project returns , any of which could have a material adverse effect on nee and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . s nee depends heavily on government policies that support utility scale renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of developing and operating wind and solar energy projects in regions in which neer and fpl operate or plan to develop and operate renewable energy facilities . the federal government , a majority of state governments in the u.s . and portions of canada provide incentives , such as tax incentives , rps or feed - in - tariffs , that support or are designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities , such as wind and solar energy facilities . the development of renewable energy facilities at acceptable prices has not historically been burdened by actions taken by the u.s . government . however , as a result of budgetary constraints , geopolitical factors , political factors or otherwise , governments from time to time may review their laws and policies that support , or do not overly burden , the development and operation of renewable energy facilities and , instead , consider actions that would make the laws and policies less conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities . any reductions or modifications to , or the elimination of , governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy , such as the ira , or the imposition of additional taxes , tariffs , duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it , such as policies in place that limit certain imports from china and other southeast asian countries , could result in , among other items , the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects , nee and fpl abandoning the development of renewable energy projects , a loss of investments in the projects and reduced project returns , any of which could have a material adverse effect on nee and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of new or revised laws or regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations . nee 's and fpl 's business is influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiatives , including , but not limited to , new or revised laws , including international trade laws , regulations and interpretations , constitutional ballot and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry , regulation of the commodities trading and derivatives markets , and regulation of environmental matters , such as regulation of air emissions , regulation of water consumption and water discharges , and regulation of gas and oil infrastructure operations , as well as associated environmental permitting . changes in the nature of the regulation of nee 's and fpl 's business could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl are unable to predict future legislative or regulatory changes , including through constitutional ballot initiatives or changed legal or regulatory interpretations , although any such changes may increase costs and competitive pressures on nee and fpl , which could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . fpl has limited , but growing , competition in the florida market for retail electricity customers and is not subject to a rps . any changes in florida law or regulation , whether through new or modified legislation or regulation or through citizen - approved state constitutional ballot initiatives , which increase competition in the florida retail electricity market , such as government incentives that would further facilitate the installation of solar generation facilities on residential or other rooftops , would permit third - party sales of electricity or would mandate the transition to renewable energy at fpl , could have a material adverse effect on fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . there can be no assurance that fpl would be able to respond adequately to such regulatory changes , which could have a material adverse effect on fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . neer is subject to ferc rules related to transmission that are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale market on practically a nationwide basis . nee can not predict the impact of changing ferc rules or policies of the rtos and isos , such as rules governing generator interconnection procedures and transmission planning requirements and cost allocation methodologies , or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand , which are typically driven by factors beyond nee 's control . there can be no assurance that neer will be able to respond adequately or sufficiently quickly to such rules and developments , which may impact the ability , timeline and cost of interconnecting new or repowered energy projects to the transmission system and the availability of transmission system capacity to deliver energy products to market , or to any changes that reverse or restrict the competitive restructuring of the energy industry in those jurisdictions in which such restructuring has occurred . any of these events could have a material adverse effect on nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl are subject to numerous environmental laws , regulations and other standards that may result in capital expenditures , increased operating costs and various liabilities , and may require nee and fpl to limit or eliminate certain operations . nee and fpl are subject to domestic environmental laws , regulations and other standards , including , but not limited to , extensive federal , state and local environmental statutes , rules and regulations relating to air quality , water quality and usage , soil quality , climate change , emissions of greenhouse gases , waste management , hazardous wastes , marine , avian , bat and other wildlife mortality and habitat protection , historical artifact preservation , natural resources , health ( including , but not limited to , electric and magnetic fields from power lines and substations ) , safety and rps , that could , among other things , prevent or delay the development of power generation , power or natural gas transmission , or other infrastructure projects , restrict or enjoin the output of some existing facilities , limit the availability and use of some fuels required for the production of electricity , require additional pollution control equipment , and otherwise increase costs , increase capital expenditures and limit or eliminate certain s operations . certain subsidiaries of nee are also subject to foreign environmental laws , regulations and other standards and , as such , are subject to similar risks . there are significant capital , operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes , rules and regulations , and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result of new requirements , stricter or more expansive application of existing environmental laws and regulations , and the addition of species , such as additional bat species , to the endangered species list . violations of current or future laws , rules , regulations or other standards could expose nee and fpl to regulatory and legal proceedings , disputes with , and legal challenges by , governmental entities and third parties , and potentially significant civil fines , criminal penalties and other sanctions , such as restrictions on how nextera energy resources develops , sites and operates wind facilities . these violations could result in , without limitation , litigation regarding property damage , personal injury , common law nuisance and enforcement by citizens or governmental authorities of environmental requirements . for example , one of nextera energy resources ' subsidiaries is currently on probation as a result of accidental collisions of eagles into wind turbines at a number of nextera energy resources ' wind facilities . if nextera energy resources ' subsidiary violates the terms of the probation , or fails to obtain eagle “ take ” permits under the bgepa or incidental take permits under the esa for certain of its wind facilities and additional eagles or listed species , like cave bats , perish in collisions with facility turbines , nextera energy resources or its subsidiaries could face criminal prosecution under these laws . nee 's and fpl 's business could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of greenhouse gas emissions . federal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases , including , but not limited to , carbon dioxide and methane , from electric generation units using fuels , such as natural gas . the potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on nee 's and fpl 's electric generation units are subject to significant uncertainties based on , among other things , the timing of the implementation of any new requirements , the required levels of emission reductions , the nature of any market - based or tax - based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions , the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offsets , the development of cost - effective , commercial - scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures , and the range of available compliance alternatives . while nee 's and fpl 's electric generation portfolio emits greenhouse gases at a lower rate of emissions than most of the u.s . electric generation sector , the results of operations of nee and fpl could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state laws or regulations impose any new greenhouse gas emission limits . any future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could : • create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emissions allowances ; • make some of nee 's and fpl 's electric generation units uneconomical to operate in the long term ; • require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology , fuel switching , or the replacement of high - emitting generation facilities with lower - emitting generation facilities ; or • affect the availability or cost of fuel , such as natural gas . there can be no assurance that nee or fpl would be able to completely recover any such costs or investments , which could have a material adverse effect on their business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . extensive federal regulation of the operations and businesses of nee and fpl exposes nee and fpl to significant and increasing compliance costs and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions for compliance failures . nee 's and fpl 's operations and businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation , which generally imposes significant and increasing compliance costs on their operations and businesses . additionally , any actual or alleged compliance failures could result in significant costs and other potentially adverse effects of regulatory investigations , proceedings , settlements , decisions and claims , including , among other items , potentially significant monetary penalties . as an example , under the energy policy act of [XXXX] , nee and fpl , as owners and operators of bulk - power transmission systems and/or electric generation facilities , are subject to mandatory reliability standards . compliance with these mandatory reliability standards may subject nee and fpl to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures . if fpl or nee is found not to be in compliance with these standards , they may incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions . both the costs of regulatory compliance and the costs that may be imposed as a result of any actual or alleged compliance failures could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . s changes in tax laws , guidance or policies , including but not limited to changes in corporate income tax rates , as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax - related asset and liability amounts , could materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's and fpl 's provision for income taxes and reporting of tax - related assets and liabilities require significant judgments and the use of estimates . amounts of tax - related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income , deductions and tax credits , including , but not limited to , estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards , such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards . actual income taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of , among other things , changes in tax laws , guidance or policies , including changes in corporate income tax rates , the issuance of guidance related to the qualification for renewable energy tax credits , the financial condition and results of operations of nee and fpl , and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities . these factors , including the ultimate resolution of income tax matters , may result in material adjustments to tax - related assets and liabilities , which could materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected due to adverse results of litigation . nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects may be materially affected by adverse results of litigation . unfavorable resolution of legal or administrative proceedings in which nee or fpl is involved or other future legal or administrative proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects of nee and fpl . allegations of violations of law by fpl or nee have the potential to result in fines , penalties , or other sanctions or effects , as well as cause reputational damage for fpl and nee , and could hamper fpl ’s and nee ’s effectiveness in interacting with governmental authorities . fpl ’s and nee ’s business and reputation could be adversely affected by allegations that fpl or nee has violated laws , by any investigations or proceedings that arise from such allegations , or by ultimate determinations of legal violations . for example , media articles have been published that allege , among other things , florida state and federal campaign finance law violations by fpl . these articles are referenced in a complaint subsequently filed with the federal election commission ( fec ) that alleges certain violations of the federal election campaign act . fpl and nee can not guarantee that the fec complaint process will not ultimately result in a finding that fpl or nee violated federal campaign finance or other laws , that applicable federal or state governmental authorities may not investigate or take enforcement actions with respect to the allegations or assert that legal violations by fpl or nee have occurred , or that violations may not ultimately be found by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authorities to have occurred . in addition , notwithstanding the completion or pendency of any internal review or investigation by fpl or nee of any allegations of legal violations , including of the allegations regarding campaign finance laws set forth in the media articles or fec complaint , fpl and nee can not provide assurance that any of the foregoing will not result in the imposition of material fines , penalties , or otherwise result in other sanctions or effects on fpl or nee , or will not have a material adverse impact on the reputation of nee or fpl or on the effectiveness of their interactions with governmental regulators or other authorities . development and operational risks nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects could suffer if nee and fpl do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of , or capital improvements to , electric generation , transmission and distribution facilities , gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget . nee 's and fpl 's ability to proceed with projects under development and to complete construction of , and capital improvement projects for , their electric generation , transmission and distribution facilities , gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities on schedule and within budget have been , in limited instances , and in the future may be , adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance , inability to obtain or renew necessary licenses , rights - of - way , permits or other approvals on acceptable terms or on schedule , disputes involving contractors , labor organizations , land owners , governmental entities , environmental groups , native american and aboriginal groups , lessors , joint venture partners , suppliers and other third parties , negative publicity , transmission interconnection issues , geopolitical factors , supply chain disruptions , inflation , rising interest rates and other factors . for example , the ability of nee and fpl to develop solar generation facilities is dependent on the international supply chain for solar panels and associated equipment , and governmental or regulatory actions have caused minor , and could in the future cause material , disruptions in the ability of nee and fpl to acquire solar panels on time and at acceptable costs . if any development project or construction or capital improvement project is not completed , is delayed or is subject to cost overruns , certain associated costs may not be approved for recovery or otherwise be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms that may be available , and nee and fpl could become obligated to make delay or termination payments or become obligated for other damages under contracts , could experience the loss of tax credits or tax incentives , or delayed or diminished returns , and could be required to write off all or a portion of their investment in the project . any of these events could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . s nee and fpl face risks related to project siting , financing , construction , permitting , governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities . nee and fpl own , develop , construct , manage and operate electric generation and transmission facilities and natural gas transmission facilities . a key component of nee 's and fpl 's growth is their ability to construct and operate generation and transmission facilities to meet customer needs . as part of these operations , nee and fpl must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local , state , federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions . should nee or fpl be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third - party challenges to such licenses or permits , should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances on nee or fpl , nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected . any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third parties could have similar results . the operation and maintenance of nee 's and fpl 's electric generation , transmission and distribution facilities , gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks , the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's and fpl 's electric generation , transmission and distribution facilities , gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks . operational risks could result in , among other things , lost revenues due to prolonged outages , increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures or legal claims , liability to third parties for property and personal injury damage or loss of life , a failure to perform under applicable power sales agreements or other agreements and associated loss of revenues from terminated agreements or liability for liquidated damages under continuing agreements , and replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at higher prices . uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining nee 's and fpl 's facilities include , but are not limited to : • risks associated with facility start - up operations , such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned ; • failures in the availability , acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies ; • the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions and natural disasters , including , but not limited to , hurricanes , tornadoes , extreme temperatures , icing events , wildfires , floods , severe convective storms , earthquakes and droughts ; • performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency ; • breakdown or failure , including , but not limited to , explosions , fires , leaks or other major events , of equipment , transmission or distribution systems or pipelines ; • availability of replacement equipment ; • risks of property damage , human injury or loss of life from energized equipment , hazardous substances or explosions , fires , leaks or other events , especially where facilities are located near populated areas ; • potential environmental impacts of gas infrastructure operations ; • risks associated with potential harm to wildlife ; • availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements ; • inability to identify , manage properly or mitigate equipment defects in nee 's and fpl 's facilities ; • use of new or unproven technology ; • risks associated with dependence on a specific type of fuel or fuel source , such as commodity price risk , availability of adequate fuel supply and transportation , and lack of available alternative fuel sources ; • increased competition due to , among other factors , new facilities , excess supply , shifting demand and regulatory changes ( such as the passage of the ira ) ; and • insufficient insurance , warranties or performance guarantees to cover any or all lost revenues or increased expenses from the foregoing . nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects may be negatively affected by a lack of growth , slower growth or a decline in the number of customers or in customer usage . growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence the demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and power delivery facilities , as well as the need for energy - related commodities , such as natural gas . customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of nee and fpl , such as mandated energy efficiency measures , demand side management requirements , installation of distributed generation technologies and economic and demographic conditions , such as population changes , job and income growth , housing starts , new business formation , inflation and the overall level of economic activity . a lack of growth , or a decline , in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity or natural gas and other fuels may cause nee and fpl to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's growth , business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . s nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions and related impacts , including , but not limited to , the impact of severe weather . weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy - related commodities . in addition , severe weather and natural disasters , such as hurricanes , floods , tornadoes , droughts , extreme temperatures , icing events , wildfires , severe convective storms and earthquakes , can be destructive and cause power outages , personal injury and property damage , reduce revenue , affect the availability of fuel and water , and require nee and fpl to incur additional costs , for example , to restore service and repair damaged facilities , to obtain replacement power , to access available financing sources , to obtain insurance , to pay for any associated injuries and damages and to fund any associated legal matters and compliance penalties . furthermore , nee 's and fpl 's physical plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns , resulting in more intense , frequent and extreme weather events , abnormal levels of precipitation and , particularly relevant to fpl , a change in sea level . fpl operates in the east and lower west coasts of florida and in northwest florida , areas that historically have been prone to severe weather events , such as hurricanes . a disruption or failure of electric generation , transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production , transmission , storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane , tornado or other severe weather event , or otherwise , could prevent nee and fpl from operating their business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above . additionally , the actions taken to address the potential for severe weather such as additional winterizing of critical equipment and infrastructure , modifying or alternating plant operations and expanding load shedding options could result in significant increases in costs . any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . at fpl and other businesses of nee where cost recovery is available , recovery of costs to restore service , to repair damaged facilities or for other actions to address severe weather is or may be subject to regulatory approval , and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . changes in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities , including , but not limited to , neer 's wind and solar facilities . for example , the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities . because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict , neer 's results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically , and nee 's results of operations generally , may vary significantly from period to period , depending on the level of available resources . to the extent that resources are not available at planned levels , the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected . threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from geopolitical factors , terrorism , cyberattacks , or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt nee 's and fpl 's business , or the businesses of third parties , may materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of geopolitical factors , terrorist acts and threats , as well as cyberattacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups . there have been cyberattacks and other physical attacks within the energy industry on energy infrastructure such as substations , gas pipelines and related assets in the past and there may be such attacks in the future . in addition , the advancement of artificial intelligence has given rise to added vulnerabilities and potential entry points for cyberattacks . nee 's and fpl 's generation , transmission , storage and distribution facilities , information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of , or otherwise be materially adversely affected by , such activities . geopolitical factors , terrorist acts , cyberattacks or other similar events affecting nee 's and fpl 's systems and facilities , or those of third parties on which nee and fpl rely , could harm nee 's and fpl 's businesses by , for example , limiting their ability to generate , purchase , store or transmit power , natural gas or other energy - related commodities , limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process payments , and delaying their development and construction of new generation , distribution , storage or transmission facilities or capital improvements to existing facilities . these events , and governmental actions in response , could result in a material decrease in revenues , significant additional costs ( for example , to repair assets , implement additional security requirements or maintain or acquire insurance ) , significant fines and penalties , and reputational damage , could materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's operations ( for example , by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas , oil and other fuels ) , and could impair nee 's and fpl 's ability to raise capital ( for example , by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity ) . in addition , the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs . such events or actions may materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . the ability of nee and fpl to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international , national , state or local events and company - specific events , as well as the financial condition of insurers . nee 's and fpl 's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses . insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be available at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to nee and fpl . the ability of nee and fpl to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international , national , state or local events and company - specific events , including s impacts of actual or perceived climate - related events , as well as the financial condition of insurers . if nee or fpl can not or does not obtain insurance coverage , nee or fpl may be required to pay costs associated with adverse future events . nee and fpl generally are not fully insured against all significant losses . for example , nee , including fpl , does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of its transmission and distribution property and natural gas pipeline assets . a loss for which nee or fpl is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee invests in gas and oil producing and transmission assets through neer ’s gas infrastructure business . the gas infrastructure business is exposed to fluctuating market prices of natural gas , natural gas liquids , oil and other energy commodities . a prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact neer ’s gas infrastructure business and cause neer to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure projects and could result in certain projects becoming impaired , which could materially adversely affect nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . natural gas and oil prices are affected by supply and demand , both globally and regionally . factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues , natural disasters , weather , political instability , conflicts , new discoveries , technological advances , economic conditions and actions by major oil - producing countries . there can be significant volatility in market prices for gas and oil , and price fluctuations could have a material effect on the financial performance of gas and oil producing and transmission assets . for example , in a low gas and oil price environment , neer would generate less revenue from its gas infrastructure investments in gas and oil producing properties , and as a result certain investments might become less profitable or incur losses . prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could also result in the delay or cancellation of oil and gas production and transmission projects , could cause projects to experience lower returns , and could result in certain projects becoming impaired , which could materially adversely affect nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . if supply costs necessary to provide neer 's full energy and capacity requirement services are not favorable , operating costs could increase and materially adversely affect nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . neer provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities , which include load - following services and various ancillary services , to satisfy all or a portion of such utilities ' power supply obligations to their customers . the supply costs for these transactions may be affected by a number of factors , including , but not limited to , events that may occur after such utilities have committed to supply power , such as weather conditions , transmission constraints , fluctuating prices for , and locational disconnects in , energy and ancillary services , and the ability of the distribution utilities ' customers to elect to receive service from competing suppliers . neer may not be able to recover all of its increased supply costs , which could have a material adverse effect on nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . due to the potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel , electricity and renewable and other energy commodities , neer 's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risks within its portfolios could materially adversely affect nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . there can be significant volatility in market prices for fuel , electricity and renewable and other energy commodities , both in general and across geographies . nee 's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively its assets or positions against changes in commodity prices , volumes , interest rates , counterparty credit risk or other risk measures , based on factors that are either within , or wholly or partially outside of , nee 's control , may materially adversely affect nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . reductions in the liquidity of energy markets may restrict the ability of nee to manage its operational risks , which , in turn , could negatively affect nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee is an active participant in energy markets . liquidity in energy markets can be described as the degree to which a product , such as electricity , gas or transmission rights , can be quickly bought or sold without significantly affecting its price and without incurring significant transaction costs . it can be driven in part by the number of active market participants and is an important factor in nee 's ability to manage risks in its participation in these markets . liquidity in the energy markets can be adversely affected by price volatility , restrictions on the availability of credit , inflation , rising interest rates and other factors , and any reduction in the liquidity of energy markets could have a material adverse effect on nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's and fpl 's hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools may not protect against significant losses . nee and fpl have hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools , such as separate but complementary financial , credit , operational , compliance and legal reporting systems , internal controls , management review processes and other mechanisms . nee and fpl are unable to assure that such procedures and tools will be effective against all potential risks , including , without limitation , employee misconduct or severe weather or operating conditions . if such procedures s and tools are not effective , this could have a material adverse effect on nee 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . if price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior , nee 's and fpl 's risk management tools associated with their hedging and trading procedures may not protect against significant losses . nee 's and fpl 's risk management tools and metrics associated with their hedging and trading procedures , such as daily value at risk , earnings at risk , stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines , are based on historical price movements . due to the inherent uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing behavior , nee and fpl are unable to assure that their risk management tools and metrics will be effective to protect against material adverse effects on their business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . if power transmission or natural gas , nuclear fuel or other commodity transportation facilities are unavailable or disrupted , the ability for subsidiaries of nee , including fpl , to sell and deliver power or natural gas may be limited . subsidiaries of nee , including fpl , depend upon power transmission and natural gas , nuclear fuel and other commodity transportation facilities , many of which they do not own . occurrences affecting the operation of these facilities that may or may not be beyond the control of subsidiaries of nee , including fpl , ( such as geopolitical factors , cyber incidents , physical attacks , severe weather or a generation or transmission facility outage , pipeline rupture , or sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind or solar generation ) may limit or halt their ability to sell and deliver power and natural gas , or to purchase necessary fuels and other commodities , which could materially adversely impact nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl are subject to credit and performance risk from customers , hedging counterparties and vendors . nee and fpl are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness and performance of their customers , hedging counterparties and vendors under contracts for the supply of equipment , materials , fuel and other goods and services required for their business operations and for the construction and operation of , and for capital improvements to , their facilities . adverse conditions in the energy industry or the general economy such as inflation , as well as circumstances of individual customers , hedging counterparties and vendors , may adversely affect the ability of some customers , hedging counterparties and vendors to perform as required under their contracts with nee and fpl . if any vendor or hedging or other counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations , nee and fpl may need to make arrangements with other counterparties or vendors , which could result in material financial losses , higher costs , untimely completion of power generation facilities and other projects , and/or a disruption of their operations . if a defaulting counterparty is in poor financial condition , nee and fpl may not be able to recover damages for any contract breach . nee and fpl could recognize financial losses or a reduction in operating cash flows if a counterparty fails to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of derivative contracts or if nee or fpl is required to post margin cash collateral under derivative contracts . nee and fpl use derivative instruments , such as swaps , options , futures and forwards , some of which are traded in the otc markets or on exchanges , to manage their commodity and financial market risks , and for nee to engage in trading and marketing activities . any failures by their counterparties to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of those transactions could have a material adverse effect on nee 's or fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . similarly , any requirement for fpl or nee to post margin cash collateral under its derivative contracts could have a material adverse effect on its business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . these risks may be increased during periods of adverse market or economic conditions such as inflation affecting the industry in which nee and fpl participate . nee and fpl are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems , and any failure or breach of those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure . despite nee 's and fpl 's implementation of security measures , all of their technology systems are vulnerable to disability , failures or unauthorized access due to such activities . if nee 's or fpl 's information technology systems were to fail or be breached , sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised and nee and fpl could be unable to fulfill critical business functions . nee 's and fpl 's businesses are highly dependent on nee 's and fpl 's ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis , a very large number of transactions , many of which are highly complex and cross numerous and diverse markets . due to the size , scope , complexity and geographical reach of nee 's and fpl 's business , the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging . nee 's and fpl 's operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are either within , or wholly or partially outside s of , their control , such as operator error , severe weather , geopolitical activities , terrorist activities or cyber incidents . any such failure or disabling event could materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's ability to process transactions and provide services , and their business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl add , modify and replace information systems on a regular basis . modifying existing information systems or implementing new or replacement information systems is costly and involves risks , including , but not limited to , integrating the modified , new or replacement system with existing systems and processes , implementing associated changes in accounting procedures and controls , and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent . any disruptions or deficiencies in existing information systems , or disruptions , delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new information systems , could result in increased costs , the inability to track or collect revenues and the diversion of management 's and employees ' attention and resources , and could negatively impact the effectiveness of the companies ' control environment , and/or the companies ' ability to timely file required regulatory reports . nee and fpl also face the risks of operational failure or capacity constraints associated with the information systems of third parties , including , but not limited to , those who provide power transmission and natural gas transportation services . nee 's and fpl 's retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised , which could result in a material adverse impact to their reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on the business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects of nee and fpl . nee 's and fpl 's retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business . nee 's and fpl 's retail businesses may also need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services , such as call center services , to the retail businesses . if a significant breach occurred , the reputation of nee and fpl could be materially adversely affected , customer confidence could be diminished , or customer information could be subject to identity theft . nee and fpl would be subject to costs associated with the breach and/or nee and fpl could be subject to fines and legal claims , any of which may have a material adverse effect on the business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects of nee and fpl . nee and fpl could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of derivative instruments and limited liquidity in otc markets . nee and fpl execute transactions in derivative instruments on either recognized exchanges or via the otc markets , depending on management 's assessment of the most favorable credit and market execution factors . transactions executed in otc markets have the potential for greater volatility and less liquidity than transactions on recognized exchanges . as a result , nee and fpl may not be able to execute desired otc transactions due to such heightened volatility and limited liquidity . in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources , the valuation of derivative instruments involves management 's judgment and use of estimates . as a result , changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these derivative instruments and have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity . from time to time , political and public sentiment may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting nee and fpl . adverse press coverage and other adverse statements , whether or not driven by political or public sentiment , may also result in investigations by regulators , legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims . responding to the negative publicity and any resulting investigations and lawsuits , regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding , can divert the time and effort of senior management from nee 's and fpl 's business . addressing any adverse publicity , governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and , regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made , can have a negative impact on the reputation of nee and fpl , on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with regulators . it may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities . the direct and indirect effects of negative publicity , and the demands of responding to and addressing it , may have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected if fpl is unable to maintain , negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in florida . fpl may negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in florida to provide electric services within such municipalities and counties , and electricity sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a very substantial portion of fpl 's revenues . if fpl is unable to maintain , negotiate or renegotiate such franchise agreements on acceptable terms , it could contribute to lower earnings and fpl may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures , which could adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . s nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs . employee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers . personnel costs may also increase due to inflationary or competitive pressures on payroll and benefits costs and revised terms of collective bargaining agreements with union employees . these consequences could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's ability to successfully identify , complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks , including , but not limited to , the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry . nee is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the energy industry . in addition , nee may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner . nuclear generation risks the operation and maintenance of nee 's and fpl 's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental , health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures . nee 's and fpl 's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental , health and financial risks , including , but not limited to , those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel , the disposition of spent nuclear fuel , leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise , the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities . nee and fpl maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks ; however , the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in nee 's and fpl 's decommissioning funds , and the exposure to liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage . if nee or fpl is unable to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or , in the case of fpl , through regulatory mechanisms , their business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected . in the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the u.s . or at certain nuclear generation facilities in europe , nee and fpl could be assessed significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies . liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the price - anderson act , which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan . in accordance with this act , nee maintains the maximum amount of private liability insurance obtainable , and participates in a secondary financial protection system , which provides liability insurance coverage for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the u.s . under the secondary financial protection system , nee is subject to retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums , plus any applicable taxes , for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the u.s . or at certain nuclear generation facilities in europe , regardless of fault or proximity to the incident . such assessments , if levied , could materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nrc orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could require nee and fpl to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues . the nrc has broad authority to impose licensing and safety - related requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities , the addition of capacity at existing nuclear generation facilities and the construction of new nuclear generation facilities , and these requirements are subject to change . in the event of non - compliance , the nrc has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down a nuclear generation facility , depending upon the nrc 's assessment of the severity of the situation , until compliance is achieved . any of the foregoing events could require nee and fpl to incur increased costs and capital expenditures , and could reduce revenues . any serious nuclear incident occurring at a nee or fpl plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses . a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear generation facility . an incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world also could cause the nrc to impose additional conditions or other requirements on the industry , or on certain types of nuclear generation units , which could increase costs , reduce revenues and result in additional capital expenditures . s the inability to operate any of nee 's or fpl 's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions could have a mater ial adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . if any of nee 's or fpl 's nuclear generation facilities are not operated for any reason through the life of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions , nee or fpl may be required to increase depreciation rates , incur impairment charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures , any of which could materially adversely affect their business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . nee 's and fpl 's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages , and for other purposes . if planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages , nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected . nee 's and fpl 's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages , including , but not limited to , inspections , repairs and certain other modifications as well as to replace equipment . in the event that a scheduled outage lasts longer than anticipated or in the event of an unplanned outage due to , for example , equipment failure , such outages could materially adversely affect nee 's or fpl 's business , financial condition , results of operations and prospects . liquidity , capital requirements and common stock risks disruptions , uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets , among other factors , may negatively affect nee 's and fpl 's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives , and can also materially adversely affect the business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects of nee and fpl . nee and fpl rely on access to capital and credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements , refinancing activities to support existing debt maturities and other requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows . disruptions , uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets , related to , among others , inflation , rising or sustained higher interest rates and geopolitical events , could increase nee 's and fpl 's cost of capital and affect their ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs , to refinance existing indebtedness and to meet their growth objectives . if nee or fpl is unable to access regularly the capital and credit markets on terms that are reasonable , it may have to delay raising capital , issue shorter - term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of capital , which , in turn , could adversely affect its ability to maintain and grow its business , could contribute to lower earnings and reduced financial flexibility , and could have a material adverse effect on its business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects . although nee 's competitive energy and certain other subsidiaries have used non - recourse or limited - recourse , project - specific or other financing in the past , market conditions , changes to regulatory capital requirements and other factors could adversely affect the future availability of such financing . the inability of nee 's subsidiaries , including , without limitation , neech and its subsidiaries , to access the capital and credit markets to provide project - specific or other financing for electric generation or other facilities or acquisitions on favorable terms , whether because of disruptions or volatility in those markets or otherwise , could necessitate additional capital raising or borrowings by nee and/or neech in the future and there can be no assurance that nee or neech will have the ability to complete such borrowings . the inability of subsidiaries that have existing project - specific or other financing arrangements to meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings , as well as actions by third parties or lenders , could give rise to a project - specific financing default which , if not cured or waived , might result in the specific project , and potentially in some limited instances its parent companies , being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated , and if such repayment were not made , the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral . such an occurrence also could result in nee expending additional funds or incurring additional obligations over the shorter term to ensure continuing compliance with project - specific financing arrangements based upon the expectation of improvement in the project 's performance or financial returns over the longer term . any of these actions could materially adversely affect nee 's business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects , as well as the availability or terms of future financings for nee or its subsidiaries . nee 's , neech 's and fpl 's inability to maintain their current credit ratings may materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's liquidity and results of operations , limit the ability of nee and fpl to grow their business , and increase interest costs . the inability of nee , neech and fpl to maintain their current credit ratings could materially adversely affect their ability to raise capital or obtain credit on favorable terms , which , in turn , could impact nee 's and fpl 's ability to grow their businesses and service indebtedness and refinance or repay borrowings , and would likely increase their interest costs . in addition , certain agreements and guarantee arrangements would require posting of additional collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade . some of the factors that can affect credit ratings are cash flows , liquidity , the amount of debt as a component of total capitalization including rating agencies ' treatment of certain indebtedness , nee 's overall business mix and political , legislative s and regulatory actions . there can be no assurance that one or more of the ratings of nee , neech and fpl will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency . nee 's and fpl 's liquidity may be impaired if their credit providers are unable to fund their credit commitments to the companies or to maintain their current credit ratings . the inability of nee 's , neech 's and fpl 's credit providers to fund their credit commitments or to maintain their current credit ratings could require nee , neech or fpl , among other things , to renegotiate requirements in agreements , find an alternative credit provider with acceptable credit ratings to meet funding requirements , or post cash collateral and could have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's liquidity . poor market performance and other economic factors could affect nee 's defined benefit pension plan 's funded status , which may materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects . nee sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of nee and its subsidiaries . a decline in the market value of the assets held in the defined benefit pension plan due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for this obligation . nee 's defined benefit pension plan is sensitive to changes in interest rates , since as interest rates decrease , the funding liabilities increase , potentially increasing benefits costs and funding requirements . any increase in benefits costs or funding requirements may have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects . poor market performance and other economic factors could adversely affect the asset values of nee 's and fpl 's nuclear decommissioning funds , which may materially adversely affect nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl are required to maintain decommissioning funds to satisfy their future obligations to decommission their nuclear power plants . a decline in the market value of the assets held in the decommissioning funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations . any increase in funding requirements may have a material adverse effect on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects . certain of nee 's investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks , which may materially adversely affect nee 's liquidity , financial condition and results of operations . nee holds certain investments where changes in the fair value affect nee 's financial results . in some cases there may be no observable market values for these investments , requiring fair value estimates to be based on other valuation techniques . this type of analysis requires significant judgment and the actual values realized in a sale of these investments could differ materially from those estimated . a sale of an investment below previously estimated value , or other decline in the fair value of an investment , could result in losses or the write - off of such investment , and may have a material adverse effect on nee 's liquidity , financial condition and results of operations . nee may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to nee . nee is a holding company and , as such , has no material operations of its own . substantially all of nee 's consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries . nee 's ability to meet its financial obligations , including , but not limited to , its guarantees , and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on its subsidiaries ' net income and cash flows , which are subject to the risks of their respective businesses , and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to nee . nee 's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no independent obligation to provide nee with funds for its payment obligations . the subsidiaries have financial obligations , including , but not limited to , payment of debt service , which they must satisfy before they can provide nee with funds . in addition , in the event of a subsidiary 's liquidation or reorganization , nee 's right to participate in a distribution of assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary 's creditors . the dividend - paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements and which may be included in future financing agreements . the future enactment of laws or regulations also may prohibit or restrict the ability of nee 's subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds . nee may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if nee is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries . nee guarantees many of the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries , other than fpl , through guarantee agreements with neech . these guarantees may require nee to provide substantial funds to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at s a time when nee is in need of liquidity to meet its own financial obligations . funding such guarantees may materially adversely affect nee 's ability to meet its financial obligations or to pay dividends . nep may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms , which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of nee ’s limited partner interest in nep opco . through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary , nee owns a limited partner interest in nep opco . nep 's inability to access capital on commercially reasonable terms when acquisitions , other growth opportunities or capital needs arise could have a material adverse effect on nep 's ability to deliver its cash distributions to its common unitholders , including nee , and on the value of nee ’s limited partnership interest in nep opco . in addition , nep 's issuance of additional common units or other securities in connection with acquisitions or the conversion of outstanding securities convertible into nep common units could cause significant common unitholder dilution and reduce cash distributions to its common unitholders , including nee . disruptions , uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may exert downward pressure on the market price of nee 's common stock . the market price and trading volume of nee 's common stock are subject to fluctuations as a result of , among other factors , general credit and capital market conditions and changes in market sentiment regarding the operations , business and financing strategies of nee , its subsidiaries and its affiliates , including nep . as a result , disruptions , uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may , for example , have a material adverse effect on the market price of nee 's common stock . widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on nee ’s and fpl 's business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects . nee and fpl are subject to the impacts of widespread public health crises , epidemics and pandemics , including , but not limited to , impacts on the global , national or local economy , capital and credit markets , nee 's and fpl 's workforce , customers and suppliers . there is no assurance that nee 's and fpl 's businesses will be able to operate without material adverse impacts depending on the nature of the public health crisis , epidemic or pandemic . the ultimate severity , duration and impact of public health crises , epidemics and pandemics can not be predicted . additionally , there is no assurance that vaccines , or other treatments , are or will be widely available or effective , or that the public will be willing to participate , in an effort to contain the spread of disease . actions taken in response to such crises by federal , state and local government or regulatory agencies may have a material adverse impact on nee 's and fpl 's business , financial condition , liquidity , results of operations and prospects ."

k , quarterly reports on form [XX] - q , current reports on form [X] - k , proxy statements and amendments to such reports . the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports , proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec at sec.gov . additionally , information about the duke energy registrants , including reports filed with the sec , is available through duke energy ’s website at duke-energy.com . such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the sec . business segments duke energy 's segment structure includes two reportable business segments : electric utilities and infrastructure ( eu&i ) and gas utilities and infrastructure ( gu&i ) . the remainder of duke energy ’s operations is presented as other . commercial renewables is reported as discontinued operations and is no longer a reportable segment beginning in the fourth quarter of [XXXX] . see note [X] to the consolidated financial statements , “ dispositions , "" for further details . duke energy 's chief operating decision - maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business . for additional information on each of these business segments , including financial and geographic information , see note [X] to the consolidated financial statements , “ business segments . ” the following sections describe the business and operations of each of duke energy ’s business segments , as well as other . electric utilities and infrastructure eu&i conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress , duke energy florida , duke energy indiana and duke energy ohio . eu&i provides retail electric service through the generation , transmission , distribution and sale of electricity to approximately [X.X] million customers within the southeast and midwest regions of the u.s . the service territory is approximately [XX,XXX] square miles across six states with a total estimated population of [XX] million . the operations include electricity sold wholesale to municipalities , electric cooperative utilities and other load - serving entities . during [XXXX] , duke energy executed an agreement providing for an investment by an affiliate of gic in duke energy indiana in exchange for a [XX.X] % minority interest issued by duke energy indiana holdco , llc , the holding company for duke energy indiana . the transaction was completed following two closings . additionally , in november [XXXX] , duke energy committed to a plan to sell the commercial renewables business segment , excluding the offshore wind contract for carolina long bay , which was moved to eu&i . duke energy entered into purchase and sale agreements with affiliates of brookfield for the sale of the utility - scale solar and wind group in june [XXXX] and with affiliates of arclight for the distributed generation group in july [XXXX] . both transactions closed in october [XXXX] . see note [X] to the consolidated financial statements , “ dispositions , "" for additional information . eu&i is also a joint owner in certain electric transmission projects . eu&i has a [XX] % ownership interest in datc , a partnership with american transmission company , formed to design , build and operate transmission infrastructure . datc owns [XX] % of the transmission service rights to path [XX] , an [XX] - mile transmission line in central california . eu&i also has a [XX] % ownership interest in pioneer , which builds , owns and operates electric transmission facilities in north america . the following map shows the service territory for eu&i as of december [XX] , [XXXX] . # # table_start business # # table_end the electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc , the nrc , the ncuc , the pscsc , the fpsc , the iurc , the puco and the kpsc . the following table represents the distribution of gwh billed sales by customer class for the year ended december [XX] , [XXXX] . # # table_start duke duke duke duke duke energy energy energy energy energy carolinas progress florida ohio indiana residential [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % general service [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % industrial [XX] % [XX] % [X] % [XX] % [XX] % total retail sales [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % [XX] % wholesale and other sales [XX] % [XX] % [X] % [X] % [XX] % total sales [XXX] % [XXX] % [XXX] % [XXX] % [XXX] % # # table_end the number of residential and general service customers within the eu&i service territory is expected to increase over time . growth in weather - normal sales volumes , however , was lower in [XXXX] compared to [XXXX] due primarily to the continuation of energy efficiency adoption , rooftop solar and broad weakness across industrial sectors . while migration to eu&i 's service territory remained strong , residential sales decreased due primarily to the return to more normal post - pandemic activities and economic conditions throughout the year . lower industrial sales continued due to overall industrial weakness , including some manufacturing plant closings across certain jurisdictions , continuation of supply chain constraints and higher inventory levels , as well as higher interest rates . this was partially offset by higher data center usage , which contributed to growth in commercial sales volumes . the impact on customer 's usage from these factors and other potential economic dynamics continues to be monitored . over the longer time frame , it is still expected that the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances will have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time . seasonality and the impact of weather revenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns . peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months , which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods . by contrast , lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall , allowing for scheduled plant maintenance . although decoupling mechanisms may mitigate some weather impacts , residential and general service customers are typically more impacted by weather than industrial customers . estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions . normal weather conditions are defined as the long - term average of actual historical weather conditions . # # table_start business # # table_end the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers ’ historic usage patterns . the methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter . the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long - term weather trends to shorter - term periods . estimates of weather impacts may be more difficult to determine during periods of extreme or more volatile weather . heating degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature . cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature . each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day . competition retail eu&i ’s businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories , with the exception of ohio , which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service . eu&i owns and operates facilities necessary to generate , transmit , distribute and sell electricity . services are priced by state commission - approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital . this regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices . in ohio , eu&i conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply . the cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers . eu&i earns retail margin in ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity , but not on the cost of the underlying energy . competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including on - site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation , such as private solar , at residential , general service and/or industrial customer sites . wholesale duke energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales , sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale transactions under primarily cost - based contracts approved by ferc . the principal factors in competing for these sales are availability of capacity and power , reliability of service and price . prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs . increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect eu&i ’s load forecasts , plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues . wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of eu&i to attract new customers and to retain existing customers . energy capacity and resources eu&i owns approximately [XX,XXX] mw of generation capacity . for additional information on owned generation facilities , see item [X] , “ properties . ” energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market . factors that could cause eu&i to purchase power for its customers may include , but are not limited to , generating plant outages , extreme weather conditions , generation reliability , demand growth and price . eu&i has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning , emergency assistance , sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply . eu&i ’s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers . all options , including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities , are continually evaluated on a real - time basis to select and dispatch the lowest - cost resources available to meet system load requirements . sources of electricity eu&i relies principally on natural gas , nuclear fuel and coal for its generation of electricity . the following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended december [XX] , [XXXX] . # # table_start cost of delivered fuel per net generation by source kilowatt - hour generated ( cents ) [XXXX] [XXXX] [XXXX] [XXXX] [XXXX] [XXXX] natural gas and fuel oil ( a ) [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [X.XX] [X.XX] [X.XX] nuclear ( a ) [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [X.XX] [X.XX] [X.XX] coal ( a ) [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [X.XX] [X.XX] [X.XX] all fuels ( cost based on weighted average ) ( a ) [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [X.XX] [X.XX] [X.XX] hydroelectric and solar ( b ) [X.X] % [X.X] % [X.X] % total generation [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [XX.X] % purchased power and net interchange [XX.X] % [XX.X] % [XX.X] % total sources of energy [XXX.X] % [XXX.X] % [XXX.X] % # # table_end ( a ) statistics related to all fuels reflect eu&i 's public utility ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities . ( b ) generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped - storage facilities during off - peak periods . # # table_start business # # table_end natural gas and fuel oil natural gas and fuel oil supply , transportation and storage for eu&i ’s generation fleet is purchased under standard industry agreements from various suppliers , including piedmont . natural gas supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns being procured over time , with varied expiration dates . eu&i believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future . eu&i has certain dual - fuel generating facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil . the cost of eu&i ’s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry publications , plus any transportation and freight costs . duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress , duke energy florida and duke energy indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas . duke energy florida has temporarily agreed to not hedge natural gas prices , but retains an ability to propose hedging again in annual fuel docket filings . eu&i has firm interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place to support generation needed for load requirements . eu&i may purchase additional shorter - term natural gas transportation and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support generation needed for load requirements . the eu&i natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines . nuclear the industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates and services to convert , enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies . eu&i has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors . uranium concentrates , conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long - term supply contracts . the contracts are diversified by supplier , country of origin and pricing . eu&i staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long - term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter . near - term requirements not met by long - term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases . due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services , eu&i generally source these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant - by - plant basis using multiyear contracts . eu&i has entered into fuel contracts that cover [XXX] % of its uranium concentrates through at least [XXXX] , [XXX] % of its conversion services through at least [XXXX] , [XXX] % of its enrichment services through at least [XXXX] , and [XXX] % of its fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least [XXXX] . for future requirements not already covered under long - term contracts , eu&i believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services . coal eu&i meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long - term purchase contracts and short - term spot market purchase agreements . large amounts of coal are purchased under long - term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface . eu&i uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long - term contracts . expiration dates for its long - term contracts , which may have various price adjustment provisions and market reopeners , range from [XXXX] to [XXXX] for duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress and duke energy indiana , [XXXX] to [XXXX] for duke energy florida and [XXXX] to [XXXX] for duke energy ohio . eu&i expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire , though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change . eu&i has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its risk management guidelines regarding projected future consumption . coal inventory levels may fluctuate as a result of volatility in natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal -

approved capacity release provisions and/or make wholesale secondary market sales . in [XXXX] , firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided for approximately [XX] % of the natural gas supply for both piedmont and duke energy ohio during the winter months and [XXX] % of forecasted demand was under contract prior to the winter heating season . impact of weather gu&i revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories . in north carolina , margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and small and medium general service customers . margin decoupling provides a set margin per customer independent of actual usage . in south carolina , tennessee and kentucky , weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been . weather normalization adjustments occur from november through march in south carolina , from october through april in tennessee and from november through april in kentucky . duke energy ohio collects most of its non - fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation . competition gu&i ’s businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories . gu&i owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas . gu&i earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity . services are priced by state commission - approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital . this regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices . in residential , commercial and industrial customer markets , natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy , primarily electric companies , propane and fuel oil dealers , renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants , as well as nuclear energy . a significant competitive factor is price . gu&i 's primary product competition is with electricity for space heating , water heating and cooking . increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer . in the case of industrial customers , such as manufacturing plants , adverse economic or market conditions , including higher natural gas costs , could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per - unit costs . higher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas , encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas - fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources . competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency , performance , reliability , safety and other non - price factors . technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non - price attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage . these factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas , impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources . this could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product , thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business , adversely affecting our earnings . natural gas investments duke energy , through its gu&i segment , has a [X.X] % equity ownership interest in sabal trail . sabal trail is a joint venture that owns the sabal trail natural gas pipeline ( sabal trail pipeline ) to transport natural gas to florida , regulated by ferc . the sabal trail phase i mainline was placed into service in july [XXXX] and traverses alabama , georgia and florida . the remaining lateral line to the duke energy florida 's citrus county cc was placed into service in march [XXXX] . phase ii of sabal trail went into service in may [XXXX] , adding approximately [XXX,XXX] dth of capacity to the sabal trail pipeline . duke energy , through its gu&i segment , has a [XX] % equity ownership interest in acp , which planned to build the acp pipeline , an approximately [XXX] -

providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital , including equity . in addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates , each of the state gas utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs , including any past over- or under - recovered costs , are prudent . natural gas costs are eligible for recovery by gu&i . due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery , changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of gu&i , unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent . however , delays between the

analysis of financial condition and results of operations – matters impacting future results "" for each registrant in item [X] , and other documents filed with the sec from time to time , the following factors should be considered in evaluating duke energy and its subsidiaries . such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought . unless otherwise indicated , risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the duke energy registrants . risks identified at the subsidiary registrant level are generally applicable to duke energy . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end business strategy risks duke energy ’s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy including achieving its carbon emissions reduction goals . duke energy ’s results of operations depend , in significant part , on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully . duke energy 's clean energy transition , which includes achieving net - zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by [XXXX] , modernizing the regulatory construct , transforming the customer experience , and digital transformation , is subject to business , policy , regulatory , technology , economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies , many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve . federal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of fuels or generation technologies , such as natural gas or nuclear power , that enable duke energy to reduce its carbon emissions . supportive policies may be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transmission and distribution upgrades needed to accommodate the build out of large volumes of renewables and energy storage . further , the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the company to continue to retire existing carbon emitting assets or make investments in new generating capacity . the company may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time . in addition , new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed including new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear , hydrogen and long - duration storage . if these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices , or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs , duke energy ’s ability to achieve a net - zero target by [XXXX] at a cost - effective price could be at risk . achieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon - free technologies including nuclear and renewables . the rapid transition to and expansion of certain low - carbon resources , such as renewables without cost - effective storage , may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon constrained environment . our nuclear fleet is central to our ability to meet these objectives and customer expectations . we are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the [XX] reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional [XX] years , extending their operating lives to and beyond midcentury . failure to receive approval from the nrc for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net - zero target by [XXXX] . as a consequence , duke energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy , which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition . regulatory , legislative and legal risks the duke energy registrants ’ regulated utility revenues , earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation , electric and natural gas transmission , distribution and related activities , which may limit their ability to recover costs . the duke energy registrants ’ regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost - of - service / rate - of - return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of north carolina , south carolina , florida , ohio , tennessee , indiana and kentucky . if the duke energy registrants ’ regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions , retail electric and natural gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions , which may decrease the duke energy registrants ’ earnings . additionally , if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service , or do not do so on a timely basis , the duke energy registrants ’ earnings could be negatively impacted . differences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations , such as north carolina and south carolina in duke energy carolinas ' and duke energy progress ' service territory , may also result in failure to recover costs . if legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the duke energy registrants ’ exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded , their earnings could be negatively impacted . federal and state regulations , laws , commercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of ee measures and distributed generation technologies , such as private solar and battery storage , in duke energy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in duke energy service territories or result in customers leaving the electric distribution system and an increase in customer net energy metering , which allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit amount . over time , customer adoption of these technologies could result in duke energy not being able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation . state regulators have approved various mechanisms to stabilize natural gas utility margins , including margin decoupling in north carolina and rate stabilization in south carolina . additionally , certain jurisdictions have established performance incentive mechanisms and revenue decoupling mechanisms for eu&i . performance incentive mechanisms condition some portion of the respective utility 's earnings on its performance on established measurable consumer , utility system , or public policy outcomes . revenue decoupling mechanisms provide periodic rate adjustments to ensure actual revenues match allowed revenues for certain customer classes . state regulators have also approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms that , for example , allow for recovery of margin losses associated with negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline . if regulators decided to discontinue the duke energy registrants ' use of tariff mechanisms or other mechanisms intended to stabilize utility margins , it would negatively impact results of operations , financial position and cash flows . in addition , regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are prudently incurred and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the duke energy registrants seek to recover from customers , which would adversely impact earnings . the rates that the duke energy registrants ’ regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge are established by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings , which may limit their ability to recover costs and earn an appropriate return on investment . the rates that the duke energy registrants ’ regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge significantly influences the results of operations , financial position and cash flows of the duke energy registrants . the regulation of the rates that the regulated utility businesses charge customers is determined , in large part , by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings . negative decisions made by these regulators , or by any court on appeal of a rate case proceeding , have , and in the future could have , a material adverse effect on the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations , financial position or cash flows and affect the ability of the duke energy registrants to adequately recover costs on a timely basis , including an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investments being made . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations , financial position or cash flows and their utility businesses . increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations , financial position or cash flows and their utility businesses . if the retail jurisdictions served by the duke energy registrants become subject to deregulation , the impairment of assets , loss of retail customers , lower profit margins or increased costs of capital , and recovery of stranded costs could have a significant adverse financial impact on the duke energy registrants . stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of the duke energy registrants whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value , as well as above - market purchased power commitments from qfs from whom the duke energy registrants are legally obligated to purchase energy at an avoided cost rate under purpa . the duke energy registrants can not predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets . the duke energy registrants can not predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation , nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations , financial position or cash flows . the duke energy registrants ’ businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies , including taxes and environmental regulations , that may change over time in ways that affect operations and costs . the duke energy registrants are subject to regulations under a wide variety of u.s . federal and state regulations and policies , including by ferc , nrc , epa and various other federal agencies as well as the north american electric reliability corporation . regulation affects almost every aspect of the duke energy registrants ’ businesses , including , among other things , their ability to : take fundamental business management actions ; determine the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services ; make acquisitions ; issue equity or debt securities ; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates ; and pay dividends upstream to the duke energy registrants . changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing . there can be no assurance that laws , regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that result in material modifications of business models and objectives or affect returns on investment by restricting activities and products , subjecting them to escalating costs , causing delays , or prohibiting them outright . the duke energy registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations , and which may impact or limit business plans , or cause exposure to environmental liabilities . the duke energy registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations , including ccrs , air emissions , water quality , wastewater discharges , solid waste and hazardous waste . these laws and regulations can result in increased capital , operating and other costs . these laws and regulations generally require the duke energy registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses , permits , inspections and other approvals . compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures , including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties . failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines , penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets , as well as reputational damage . the steps the duke energy registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive . as a result , the duke energy registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities , which may cause the duke energy registrants to incur losses . further , the duke energy registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers . also , the duke energy registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects . delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals , failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented , delayed or subject to additional costs . although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations , financial position and cash flows due to regulatory cost recovery , the duke energy registrants are at risk that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will have such an effect . the epa has issued or proposed federal regulations governing the management of cooling water intake structures , wastewater , ccr management units , and co [X] emissions . new state legislation could impose carbon reduction goals that are more aggressive than the company 's plans . these regulations may require the duke energy registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs . the duke energy registrants ' operations , capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change . there is continued concern , and increasing activism , both nationally and internationally , about climate change . the epa and state regulators have , and may adopt and implement , additional regulations to restrict emissions of ghgs to address global climate change , as well as reporting requirements regarding such emissions and related climate - goal claims . certain local and state jurisdictions have also enacted laws to restrict or prevent new natural gas infrastructure . increased regulation of ghg emissions and reporting requirements could impose significant additional costs on the duke energy registrants ' electric and natural gas operations , their suppliers and customers and affect demand for energy conservation and renewable products , which could impact both our electric and natural gas businesses . regulatory changes could also result in generation facilities to be retired earlier than planned to meet our net - zero [XXXX] goal . though we would plan to seek cost recovery for investments related to ghg emissions reductions through regulatory rate structures , changes in the regulatory climate could result in the delay in or failure to fully recover such costs and investment in generation . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end operational risks the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market , economic and other conditions that are beyond their control . sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the duke energy registrants operate and negatively influence operations . declines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of economic downturns in the duke energy registrants ’ regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows , especially as industrial customers reduce production and , therefore , consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas . although the duke energy registrants ’ regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs , such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs , under periodic adjustment clauses , overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows , thereby diminishing results of operations . a continuation of adverse economic conditions including economic downturn or high commodity prices could also negatively impact the financial stability of certain of our customers and result in their inability to pay for electric and natural gas services . this could lead to increased bad debt expense and higher allowance for doubtful account reserves for the duke energy registrants and result in delayed or unrecovered operating costs and lower financial results . additionally , prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write - down the carrying value of certain assets , including goodwill , to their respective fair values . the duke energy registrants also monitor the impacts of inflation on the procurement of goods and services and seek to minimize its effects in future periods through pricing strategies , productivity improvements , and cost reductions . rapidly rising prices as a result of inflation or other factors may impact the ability of the company to recover costs timely or execute on its business strategy including the achievement of growth objectives . the duke energy registrants sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis . with respect to such transactions , the duke energy registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates , and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend , in large part , upon prevailing market prices . these market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could negatively impact the company 's ability to accurately forecast the financial impact or reduce the duke energy registrants ’ revenues and margins , thereby diminishing results of operations . factors that could impact sales volumes , generation of electricity and market prices at which the duke energy registrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows : • weather conditions , including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes , as applicable , and periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner ; • supply of and demand for energy commodities ; • transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies ; • availability of purchased power ; • availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources , which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal , nuclear or natural gas plants , and customer usage of energy - efficient equipment that reduces energy demand ; • natural gas , crude oil and refined products production levels and prices ; • ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory , including materials , supplies , and fuel such as coal , natural gas and uranium ; and • capacity and transmission service into , or out of , the duke energy registrants ’ markets . natural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the duke energy registrants ’ operating results . natural disasters or operational accidents within the company or industry ( such as forest fires , earthquakes , hurricanes or natural gas transmission pipeline explosions ) could have direct or indirect impacts to the duke energy registrants or to key contractors and suppliers . further , the generation of electricity and the transportation and storage of natural gas involve inherent operating risks that may result in accidents involving serious injury or loss of life , environmental damage or property damage . such events could impact the duke energy registrants through civil or criminal legal proceedings or changes to policies , laws and regulations whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations , financial position and cash flows . in addition , if a serious operational accident were to occur , existing insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred , including potential litigation awards . any losses not covered by insurance , or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance as a result of such accident , could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations , financial position , cash flows and reputation of the duke energy registrants . the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrants could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with federal and state regulations , laws , and other legal requirements that govern the operations , assessments , storage , closure , remediation , disposal and monitoring relating to ccr , the high costs and new rate impacts associated with implementing these new ccr - related requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations . as a result of electricity produced for decades at coal - fired power plants , the duke energy registrants manage large amounts of ccr that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in surface impoundments , all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements . a ccr - related operational incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and results of operations , financial position and cash flows of the duke energy registrants . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end during [XXXX] , epa regulations were enacted related to the management of ccr from power plants . these regulations classify ccr as nonhazardous waste under the rcra and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and , new and existing surface impoundments , and establish requirements regarding landfill design , structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments , groundwater monitoring , protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of ccr . in addition to the federal regulations , ccr landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws , regulations and permits , as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future , such as the settlement reached with the ncdeq to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in north carolina , and partially excavate the remaining two , and the epa 's january [XX] , [XXXX] , issuance of a letter interpreting the ccr rule , including its applicability and closure provisions . these federal and state laws , regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures , including increased operating and maintenance costs , which could affect the results of operations , financial position and cash flows of the duke energy registrants . the duke energy registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions , who permit recovery in rates of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with the duke energy registrants ’ regulated operations , and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs , although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery . in addition , the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on duke energy 's cash flows . the duke energy registrants have recognized significant aros related to these ccr - related requirements . closure activities began in [XXXX] at the four sites specified as high priority by the coal ash act and at the w.s . lee steam station site in south carolina in connection with other legal requirements . excavation at these sites involves movement of ccr materials to off - site locations for use as structural fill , to appropriately engineered off - site or on - site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use . duke energy has completed excavation of coal ash at the four high - priority north carolina sites . at other sites , planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs , and closure activities have commenced . as the closure and ccr management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site , the scope and complexity of work and the amount of ccr material could be greater than estimates and could , therefore , materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts . the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations , financial position and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers , or decline in customer demand or number of customers . growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities . customer growth and customer usage are affected by several factors outside the control of the duke energy registrants , such as mandated ee measures , demand - side management goals , distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions , such as inflation and interest rate volatility , population changes , job and income growth , housing starts , new business formation and the overall level of economic activity . in addition , certain regulatory and legislative bodies have passed legislation implementing the extension of certain tax credits to be used toward the costs of residential solar installation or have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates in response to concerns related to climate change . additionally , technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of ee in end - use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption . advances in distributed generation technologies that produce power , including fuel cells , microturbines , wind turbines and solar cells , may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the duke energy registrants . in addition , the electrification of buildings and appliances currently relying on natural gas could reduce the number of customers in our natural gas distribution business . some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the failure of the duke energy registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures , which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations , financial position and cash flows . furthermore , the duke energy registrants currently have ee riders in place to recover the cost of ee programs in north carolina , south carolina , florida , indiana , ohio and kentucky . should the duke energy registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation , regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact . the duke energy registrants future results of operations may be impacted by changing expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental , social and governance concerns . duke energy ’s ability to execute its strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers , regulators , investors , and stakeholders . those expectations are based in part on the core fundamentals of reliability and affordability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products , services and offerings . additionally , the risks of global climate change continues to shape our customers ’ sustainability goals and energy needs as well as the investment and financing criteria of investors . failure to meet these increasing expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures from regulators , customers , investors and other stakeholders may impact duke energy ’s reputation and affect its ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases and the results of operations for the duke energy registrants . furthermore , the increasing use of social media may accelerate and increase the potential scope of negative publicity we might receive and could increase the negative impact on our reputation , business , results of operations , and financial condition . as it relates to electric generation , a diversified fleet with increasingly clean generation resources may facilitate more efficient financing and lower costs . conversely , jurisdictions utilizing more carbon - intensive generation such as coal may experience difficulty attracting certain investors and obtaining the most economical financing terms available . furthermore , with this heightened emphasis on environmental , social , and governance concerns , and climate change in particular , there is an increased risk of litigation , activism , and legislation from groups both in support of and opposed to various environmental , social and governance initiatives , which could cause delays and increase the costs of our clean energy transition . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end the duke energy registrants ’ operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather , including extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns from climate change . electric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal businesses . in most parts of the u.s . , the demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months , with market prices also typically peaking at that time . in other areas , demand for power peaks during the winter . demand for natural gas peaks during the winter months . further , changing frequency or magnitude of extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes , droughts , heat waves , winter storms and severe weather , including from climate change , could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced . as a result , the overall operating results of the duke energy registrants ’ businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period - to - period comparison less relevant . sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants , as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations , as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment . furthermore , destruction caused by severe weather events , such as hurricanes , flooding , tornadoes , severe thunderstorms , snow and ice storms , including from climate change , can result in lost operating revenues due to outages , property damage , including downed transmission and distribution lines , reputational harm , and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage . the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process . the duke energy registrants ’ sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate , reliable and affordable access to transmission assets . the duke energy registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market . in addition , the growth of renewables and energy storage will put strains on existing transmission assets and require transmission and distribution upgrades . the ferc ’s power transmission regulations require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open - access , non - discriminatory basis . if transmission is disrupted , or if transmission capacity is inadequate , the duke energy registrants ’ ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered . the different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures , which could affect growth and performance in these regions . in addition , the isos who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past , and may impose in the future , price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets . these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the duke energy registrants ’ wholesale power marketing business . the availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease . the duke energy registrants purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable service territories . interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to the duke energy registrants ' systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of their core markets . a significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including , but not limited to , operational failures or disruptions , hurricanes , tornadoes , floods , freeze off of natural gas wells , terrorist or cyberattacks or other acts of war or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements , including remediation related to integrity inspections or regulations and laws enacted to address climate change , could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings . moreover , if additional natural gas infrastructure , including , but not limited to , exploration and drilling rigs and platforms , processing and gathering systems , offshore pipelines , interstate pipelines and storage , can not be built at a pace that meets demand , then growth opportunities could be limited . fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the duke energy registrants ’ operations as well as their results of operations , financial position and cash flows . the duke energy registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas , coal , fuel oil , nuclear fuel , electricity and other energy - related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy - related assets . fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses , subject to the approval of state utility commissions . additionally , the duke energy registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations . disruption in the delivery of fuel , including disruptions as a result of , among other things , bankruptcies , transportation delays , weather , labor relations , force majeure events or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers , could limit the duke energy registrants ' ability to operate their facilities . should counterparties fail to perform , the duke energy registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts , if any , already paid to the counterparties . certain of the duke energy registrants ’ hedge agreements may result in the receipt of , or posting of , collateral with counterparties , depending on the daily market - based calculation of financial exposure of the derivative positions . fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties could negatively impact liquidity . downgrades in the duke energy registrants ’ credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements . the duke energy registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end cyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the duke energy registrants ' businesses . cybersecurity risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication , magnitude and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches . duke energy relies on the continued operation of sophisticated digital information technology systems and network infrastructure , which are part of an interconnected regional grid . additionally , connectivity to the internet continues to increase through grid modernization and other operational excellence initiatives . because of the critical nature of the infrastructure , increased connectivity to the internet and technology systems ’ inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking , viruses , acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches , the duke energy registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattacks from foreign or domestic sources and have been subject , and will likely continue to be subject , to cyberattacks designed to gain unauthorized access to information and/or information systems or to disrupt utility operations through computer viruses and phishing attempts either directly or indirectly through its material vendors or related third parties . in the event of a significant cybersecurity breach on either the duke energy registrants or with one of our material vendors or related third parties , the duke energy registrants could ( i ) have business operations disrupted , including the disruption of the operation of our natural gas and electric assets and the power grid , theft of confidential company , employee , retiree , shareholder , vendor or customer information , and general business systems and process interruption or compromise , including preventing the duke energy registrants from servicing customers , collecting revenues or the recording , processing and/or reporting financial information correctly , ( ii ) experience substantial loss of revenues , repair and restoration costs , penalties and costs for lack of compliance with relevant regulations , implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and ( iii ) be subject to increased regulation , litigation and reputational damage . while duke energy maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events , such insurance does not protect duke energy from such cyberattacks occurring , and while it does provide some potential mitigation of the financial impacts resulting from such cyberattacks , it is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses , costs or damage experienced . also , the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures . the duke energy registrants are subject to standards enacted by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by ferc regarding protection of the physical and cybersecurity of critical infrastructure assets required for operating north america 's bulk electric system . the duke energy registrants are also subject to regulations set by the nuclear regulatory commission regarding the protection of digital computer and communication systems and networks required for the operation of nuclear power plants . the duke energy registrants that operate designated critical pipelines that transport natural gas are also subject to security directives issued by the department of homeland security 's transportation security administration ( tsa ) requiring such registrants to implement specific cybersecurity mitigation measures . while the duke energy registrants believe they are in compliance with , or , in the case of recent tsa security directives , are in the process of implementing such standards and regulations , the duke energy registrants have from time to time been , and may in the future be , found to be in violation of such standards and regulations . in addition , compliance with or changes in the applicable standards and regulations may subject the duke energy registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures as well as substantial fines for non - compliance . the duke energy registrants ’ operations have been and may be affected by pandemic health events , including covid-19 , in ways listed below and in ways the duke energy registrants can not predict at this time . the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to respond to it have resulted in widespread adverse consequences on the global economy and on the duke energy registrants ’ customers , third - party vendors , and other parties with whom we do business . if the covid-19 pandemic or other health epidemics and outbreaks that may occur are significantly prolonged , it could impact the duke energy registrants ' business strategy , results of operations , financial position and cash flows in the future as a result of delays in rate cases or other legal proceedings , an inability to obtain labor or equipment necessary for the construction of large capital projects , an inability to procure satisfactory levels of fuels or other necessary equipment for the continued production of electricity and delivery of natural gas , volatility in global equity securities markets , and the health and availability of our critical personnel and their ability to perform business functions . duke energy ohio ’s and duke energy indiana ’s membership in an rto presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations , financial position and cash flows . the rules governing the various regional power markets may change , which could affect duke energy ohio ’s and duke energy indiana ’s costs and/or revenues . both duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana have trackers to recover approved rto costs , but to the degree duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an rto that are not approved for recovery , their results of operations may be impacted . duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in rto transmission rate design , while being able to allocate costs of projects built by duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana to others . duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an rto rather than their own internal planning process . in addition , rtos have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability , reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on the results of operations , financial position and cash flows of duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana . as members of an rto , duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are subject to certain additional risks , including those associated with the allocation among rto members , of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the rto markets not covered by collateral requirements and those associated with complaint cases filed against an rto that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by rto members . the duke energy registrants may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled . duke energy ’s long - term strategy requires the construction of new projects , either wholly owned or partially owned , which involve a number of risks , including construction delays , delays in or failure to receive required regulatory approvals and/or sitting or environmental permits , nonperformance by equipment and other third - party suppliers , and increases in equipment and labor costs . to limit the risks of these construction projects , the duke energy registrants enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits . if any of these projects are canceled for any reason , including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits , significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur . in addition , if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset , an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end the duke energy registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs . the financial condition of some insurance companies , actual or threatened physical or cyberattacks , and natural disasters , among other things , could have disruptive effects on insurance markets . the availability of insurance covering risks that the duke energy registrants and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease , and the insurance that the duke energy registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles , higher premiums , and more restrictive policy terms . further , the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred . any losses not covered by insurance , or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance , could adversely affect the results of operations , financial position or cash flows of the affected duke energy registrant . our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders . while we strive to maintain constructive communications with our shareholders , activist shareholders may , from time to time , engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals , or otherwise attempt to affect changes and assert influence on our board and management . perceived uncertainties as to the future direction or governance of the company may cause concern to our current or potential regulators , vendors or strategic partners , or make it more difficult to execute on our strategy or to attract and retain qualified personnel , which may have a material impact on our business and operating results . in addition , actions such as those described above could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock , based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business . nuclear generation risks duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress and duke energy florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities . ownership interests in and operation of nuclear stations by duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress and duke energy florida subject them to various risks . these risks include , among other things : the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facilities and the storage , handling and disposal of radioactive materials ; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations ; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives ; and the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of nuclear facilities . ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety - related requirements imposed by the nrc . in the event of non - compliance , the nrc may increase regulatory oversight , impose fines or shut down a unit depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation . revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the nrc , which could be prompted by , among other things , events within or outside of the control of duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress and duke energy florida , such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party , could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures , as well as assessments to cover third - party losses . in addition , if a serious nuclear incident were to occur , it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations , financial position , cash flows and reputation of the duke energy registrants . liquidity , capital requirements and common stock risks the duke energy registrants rely on access to short - term borrowings and longer - term debt and equity markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs . access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions , many of which are beyond the duke energy registrants ’ control . the duke energy registrants ’ businesses are significantly financed through issuances of debt and equity . the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets . accordingly , as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities , the duke energy registrants rely on access to short - term money markets as well as longer - term capital markets . the subsidiary registrants also rely on access to short - term intercompany borrowings . if the duke energy registrants are not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all , the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected . an inability to access debt and equity may limit the duke energy registrants ’ ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth . market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets . such disruptions could include : economic downturns , unfavorable capital market conditions , market prices for natural gas and coal , geopolitical risks , actual or threatened terrorist attacks , or the overall health of the energy industry . additionally , rapidly rising interest rates could impact the ability to affordably finance the capital plan or increase rates to customers and could have an impact on our ability to execute on our clean energy transition . the availability of credit under duke energy ’s master credit facility depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise . systemic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement . duke energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax - exempt bonds that may be put to the duke energy registrant issuer at the option of the holder . the facility includes borrowing sublimits for the duke energy registrants , each of whom is a party to the credit facility , and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity . failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude duke energy from issuing commercial paper or the duke energy registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the master credit facility . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end the duke energy registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings . if the duke energy registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings , they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash , which may materially adversely affect their liquidity . each of the duke energy registrants ’ senior long - term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies . the duke energy registrants can not ensure their senior long - term debt will be rated investment grade in the future . if the rating agencies were to rate the duke energy registrants below investment grade , borrowing costs would increase , perhaps significantly . in addition , the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease . further , if the short - term debt rating were to fall , access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited . a downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit , commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements , which would require cash payments . all of these events would likely reduce the duke energy registrants ’ liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their results of operations , financial position and cash flows . non - compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the duke energy registrants ’ ability to execute future borrowings . the duke energy registrants ’ debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants . failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements . market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the ndtf investments of duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress and duke energy florida , which then could require significant additional funding . ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants . the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations . duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress and duke energy florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts . these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns , which may fall below projected rates of return . although a number of factors impact funding requirements , a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants . if duke energy carolinas , duke energy progress and duke energy florida are unable to successfully manage their ndtf assets or if the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities exceeds the amount available in decommissioning funds and such costs can not be recovered through insurance or regulatory mechanisms , their results of operations , financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected . poor investment performance of the duke energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrants ’ liquidity and results of operations . the costs of providing non - contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors , such as the rates of return on plan assets , discount rates , the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans , future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans . the subsidiary registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans . without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and , depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above , duke energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash . such cash funding obligations , and the subsidiary registrants ’ proportionate share of such cash funding obligations , could have a material adverse impact on the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations , financial position and cash flows . duke energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations . because duke energy is a holding company with no operations or cash flows of its own , its ability to meet its financial obligations , including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock , is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds . prior to funding duke energy , its subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied . these subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide duke energy with funds . in addition , duke energy may provide capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances , which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations , including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on duke energy ’s common stock . general risks the failure of duke energy information technology systems , or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology , could adversely affect the duke energy registrants ’ businesses . duke energy ’s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems , including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes . any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations . in the ordinary course of business , we rely on information technology systems , including the internet and third - party hosted services , to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data , including ( i ) intellectual property , ( ii ) proprietary business information , ( iii ) personally identifiable information of our customers , employees , retirees and shareholders and ( iv ) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments , accounting , procurement , and supply chain activities . our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers , as well as their respective vendors , many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future . these providers ’ systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches , outages from fire , floods , power loss , telecommunications failures , break - ins and similar events . failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect the results of operations , financial position and cash flows of the duke energy registrants . # # table_start risk factors # # table_end in addition to maintaining our current information technology systems , duke energy believes the digital transformation of its business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers . duke energy ’s information technology systems are critical to cost - effective , reliable daily operations and our ability to effectively serve our customers . we expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology - driven solutions and we must enhance or replace our information technology systems in response . this involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand . if we fail to successfully implement critical technology , or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands , such failure could materially adversely affect our business strategy as well as impact the results of operations , financial position and cash flows of the duke energy registrants . potential terrorist activities , or military or other actions , could adversely affect the duke energy registrants ’ businesses . the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the u.s . and its allies may lead to increased political , economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil , which may have material adverse effects in ways the duke energy registrants can not predict at this time . in addition , future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the u.s . and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the u.s . information technology systems , transportation systems for our fuel sources including natural gas pipelines , transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups that could have a material adverse effect on duke energy registrants ' businesses . in particular , the duke energy registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems , transmission and distribution and generation facilities , including nuclear power plants under the nrc ’s design basis threat requirements . these increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident . failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrants ’ results of operations . certain events , such as an aging workforce , mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs , or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs . the challenges include lack of resources , loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development . in this case , costs , including costs for contractors to replace employees , productivity costs and safety costs , may increase . failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees , including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees , or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business , especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized , technology - enabled power grid . if the duke energy registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce , their results of operations , financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected ."

among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors , including price , availability , technological advancements , service , and reliability . these factors are , in turn , affected by , among other influences , regulatory , political , and environmental considerations , taxation , and supply . the retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the state of georgia are regulated by the territorial electric service act of [XXXX] . pursuant to standards set forth in this act , the georgia psc has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier . notwithstanding such assignments , this act provides that any new customer locating outside of [XXXX] municipal limits and having a connected load of at least [XXX] kws may exercise a one - time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice . pursuant to the [XXXX] utility act , the mississippi psc issued "" grandfather certificates "" of public convenience and necessity to mississippi power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern mississippi , then served in whole or in part by mississippi power , authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state . the six cooperatives serve approximately [XXX,XXX] retail customers in a certificated area of approximately [XX,XXX] square miles . in areas included in a "" grandfather certificate , "" the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric system subject to certain regulatory approvals ; extensions of facilities by such utility , or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities , may not be made unless the mississippi psc grants a cpcn . areas included in a cpcn that are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the cpcn , irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality . on the other hand , the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the mississippi psc . generally , the traditional electric operating companies have experienced , and expect to continue to experience , competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self - generation ( as described below ) and distributed generation technologies , as well as other factors . further technological advancements or the implementation of policies in support of alternative energy sources may result in further competition . southern power competes with investor - owned utilities , ipps , and others for wholesale energy sales across various u.s . utility markets . the needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available . southern power 's success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of southern power 's plants , availability of transmission to serve the demand , price , and southern power 's ability to contain costs . i-8

industrial customers . under the terms of this contract , mississippi power purchases any excess generation . during [XXXX] , mississippi power did not make any such purchases . natural gas southern company gas ' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive franchise territories but face competition from other energy products . their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil and propane providers serving the residential , commercial , and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance . competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install . customers generally use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment . customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors , including : • changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy ; • general economic conditions ; • energy conservation , including state - supported energy efficiency programs ; • legislation and regulations , including certain bans on the use of natural gas in new or existing construction and electrification initiatives ; • the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products ; and • technological or regulatory changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances . southern company gas has natural gas - related programs that generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities . in addition , southern company gas partners with third - party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances . seasonality and demand the demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather . while the electric power sales of some electric utilities peak in the summer , others peak in the winter . in the aggregate , during normal weather conditions , the southern company system 's electric power sales peak during both the summer and winter . in most of the areas southern company gas serves , natural gas demand peaks during the winter . as a result , the overall operating results of the registrants in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis . in addition , the subsidiary registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder . see management 's discussion and analysis – future earnings potential – "" general "" and – results of operations – "" southern company gas "" in item [X] herein for information regarding trends in market demand for electricity and natural gas and the impact of seasonality on southern company gas ' business ,

note [X] to the financial statements under "" environmental remediation "" and note [X] to the financial statements in item [X] herein for information concerning environmental laws and regulations impacting the registrants . rate matters rate structure and cost recovery plans electric the rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective retail service territories . rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon kwhs used and include minimum charges . residential and other rates contain separate customer charges . rates for commercial service are also of the block type and , for large customers , the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges . these large customers ' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off - peak usage . additionally , alabama power and mississippi power are generally allowed by their respective state pscs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers , subject to final state psc approval . the traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward - looking , cost - based rate mechanisms . fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions . these fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the respective pscs . approved compliance , storm damage , and certain other costs are recovered at alabama power and mississippi power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective pscs . certain similar costs at georgia power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the georgia psc . costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at alabama power and mississippi power through annual , formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at georgia power through periodic base rate proceedings . see note [X] to the financial statements in item [X] herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms . also see "" integrated resource planning "" herein for additional information . the traditional electric operating companies and southern power company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the ferc to sell power to non - affiliates , including short - term opportunity sales , at market - based prices . specific ferc approval must be obtained with respect to a market - based contract with an affiliate . mississippi power provides service under long - term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern mississippi under requirements cost - based electric tariffs , which are subject to regulation by the ferc . the contracts with these wholesale customers represented [XX.X] % of mississippi power 's total operating revenues in [XXXX] . natural gas southern company gas ' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies . rates charged to customers vary according to customer class ( residential , commercial , or industrial ) and rate jurisdiction . these agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently - incurred costs , including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable roe . with the exception of atlanta gas light , the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas . the natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes . atlanta gas light operates in a deregulated environment in which marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end - use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the georgia psc . i-11 index to financial statements in addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms , other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders , which vary by utility , allow recovery of certain costs , such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation , energy efficiency plans , and bad debts . see note [X] to the financial statements under "" southern company gas "" in item [X] herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms . integrated resource planning each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost - effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers . in addition , each year the southern company system engages in a scenario planning process , developing scenarios which look out over a [XX] - year horizon . in [XXXX] , scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices , load growth , and co [X] prices starting between $ [X] and $ [XX] per metric ton of co [X] emitted and escalating over the [XX] - year horizon . see management 's discussion and analysis – future earnings potential – "" environmental matters "" in item [X]

power 's resource planning process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting alabama power 's portfolio of supply - side and demand - side resources . the irp report facilitates alabama power 's ability to provide reliable and cost - effective electric service to customers , while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet expected customer demand . under state of alabama law , a ccn must be obtained from the alabama psc before alabama power constructs any new generating facility , unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business . alabama power provided its most recent irp to the alabama psc during [XXXX] . see note [X] to the financial statements under "" alabama power – rate cnp new plant "" in item [X] herein for additional information . georgia power triennially , georgia power must file an irp with the georgia psc that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a combination of demand - side and supply - side resources . the georgia psc , under state law , must certify any new demand - side or supply - side resources for georgia power to receive cost recovery . once certified , the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates . certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud , concealment , failure to disclose a material fact , imprudence , or criminal misconduct . in july [XXXX] , the georgia psc approved georgia power 's [XXXX] irp , as modified by a stipulated agreement among georgia power , the staff of the georgia psc , and certain intervenors and as further modified by the georgia psc . on october [XX] , [XXXX] , georgia power filed an updated irp ( [XXXX] irp update ) with the georgia psc , which sets forth a plan to support the recent increase in the state of georgia 's projected energy needs since the [XXXX] irp . georgia power expects the georgia psc to render a final decision on the [XXXX] irp update on april [XX] , [XXXX] . the ultimate

discussion and analysis – future earnings potential in item [X] , and other documents filed by southern company and/or its subsidiaries with the sec , the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating southern company and its subsidiaries . such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statements made by , or on behalf of , southern company and/or its subsidiaries . the risk factors discussed below could adversely affect a registrant 's results of operations , financial condition , liquidity , and cash flow , as well as cause reputational damage . utility regulatory , legislative , and litigation risks southern company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial federal , state , and local governmental regulation , including with respect to rates . compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals , permits , and certificates may result in substantial costs to southern company and its subsidiaries . laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services the southern company system offers , protection of critical electric infrastructure assets , transmission planning , reliability , pipeline safety , interaction with wholesale markets and retail customers , and relationships with affiliates , among other matters . the registrants ' businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if a registrant is found to be noncompliant . the profitability of the traditional electric operating companies ' and the natural gas distribution utilities ' businesses is largely dependent on their ability , through the rates that they are permitted to charge , to recover their costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital . the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities seek to recover their costs , including a reasonable return on invested capital , through their retail rates , which must be approved by the applicable state psc or other applicable state regulatory agency . such regulators , in a future rate proceeding , may alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return ; rate refunds may also be required . the outcome of any such proceeding could be impacted by a variety of factors , including the level of opposition from intervenors , potential impacts to customers , and past or future changes in the political , regulatory , economic , or legislative environment . additionally , the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional electric operating companies and southern power and the rates charged to natural gas transportation customers by southern company gas ' pipeline investments must be approved by the ferc . changes to southern power 's and the traditional electric operating companies ' ability to conduct business pursuant to ferc market - based rate authority could affect wholesale rates . also , while a small percentage of transmission costs are recovered through wholesale electric tariffs , the majority are recovered through retail rates . transmission planning and the resulting grid improvements could be impacted by ferc policy changes as well as north american electric reliability corporation planning standard changes . the ira , among other items , imposes a [XX] % corporate minimum tax on book income and is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the u.s . treasury department and the irs . any rate recovery by the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities will be determined pursuant to the regulatory processes of the ferc , state pscs , or other applicable state regulatory agencies . there is no assurance , however , that such tax expense will be recoverable through the applicable regulatory process . the impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to southern company or any of its subsidiaries is uncertain . changes in regulation , the imposition of additional regulations , changes in application of existing regulations and in enforcement practices of regulators , or penalties imposed for noncompliance with existing laws or regulations could influence the operating environment of the southern company system and may result in substantial costs . the southern company system 's costs of compliance with environmental laws and satisfying related aros are significant . the southern company system 's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air , ghgs , water , land , avian and other wildlife and habitat protection , and other natural resources . compliance with existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs including the settlement of aros , a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates . there is no assurance , however , that all such costs will be recovered . the registrants expect future compliance expenditures will continue to be significant . the epa has adopted and is implementing regulations governing air and ghg emissions under the clean air act and water quality under the clean water act . the epa and certain states have also adopted and continue to propose regulations governing the disposal and management of ccr at power plant sites under the resource conservation and recovery act and applicable state laws . the cost estimates for aros related to the disposal of ccr are based on information using various assumptions i-15 index to financial statements related to closure and post - closure costs , timing of future cash outlays , inflation and discount rates , and the potential compliance methods . the traditional electric operating companies will continue to periodically update their aro cost estimates and those updates could be material . additionally , environmental laws and regulations covering the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances could require the southern company system to incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites , including certain current and former operating sites , and locations subject to contractual obligations . litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types , including property damage , personal injury , and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements has occurred throughout the united states . this litigation has included , but is not limited to , claims for damages alleged to have been caused by co [X] and other emissions , ccr , releases of regulated substances , alleged exposure to regulated substances , and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters . compliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of operations for the southern company system . the southern company system 's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental expenditures will depend on various factors , such as state adoption and implementation of requirements , the availability and cost of any deployed control technology , fuel prices , and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges . compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls , closure and monitoring of ccr facilities , unit retirements , operational changes , or changing fuel sources for certain existing units , as well as related upgrades to the southern company system 's transmission and distribution ( electric and natural gas ) systems . environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated and could adversely affect the registrants if such costs can not continue to be recovered on a timely basis . further , increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas . additionally , many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements , which for some may have the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas . the southern company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of ghg legislation , regulation , and emission reduction goals . concern and activism about climate change continue to increase and , as a result , demand for energy conservation and sustainable assets could further increase . additionally , costs associated with ghg legislation , regulation , and emission reduction goals could be significant and there is no assurance such costs would be fully recovered through regulated rates or ppas . the southern company system has processes for identifying , assessing , and responding to climate - related risks , including a scenario planning process that is used to inform resource planning decisions in the states in which the traditional electric operating companies operate . this process relies on information and assumptions from internal and external sources , which may or may not be accurate in predicting future outcomes . additional ghg policies , including legislation , may emerge requiring the united states to accelerate its transition to a lower ghg emitting economy . the ultimate impact will depend on various factors , such as state adoption and implementation of requirements , natural gas prices , the development , deployment , and advancement of relevant energy technologies , the ability to recover costs through existing ratemaking provisions , and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges . the sec has proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of climate - related matters . if the proposed rules , or similar rules , are enacted , the registrants could incur increased costs to comply with these new rules and could face increased risk of litigation related to disclosures made pursuant to the rules . because natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels , future carbon constraints , including , but not limited to , the imposition of a carbon tax , may create additional demand for natural gas , both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses . however , such demand may be tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain circumstances , including use in new construction and certain household appliances . additionally , efforts to electrify the transportation , building , and other sectors may result in higher electric demand and negatively impact natural gas demand . for example , nicor gas ' regulator , the illinois commission , has ordered a "" future of natural gas "" proceeding to explore the recommendations involved with decarbonization of the gas distribution system in illinois . in addition , future ghg constraints , including those related to methane emissions , designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs to the southern company system and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas . southern company has established an intermediate goal of a [XX] % reduction in ghg emissions from [XXXX] levels by [XXXX] and a long - term goal of net zero ghg emissions by [XXXX] . achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors , including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no - ghg energy technologies and negative carbon concepts . the strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including i-16 index to financial statements low - carbon and carbon - free resources and energy efficiency resources ; customer demand for carbon - free energy ; continuing to transition the southern company system 's generating fleet and making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems ; continuing research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower ghg emissions , including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere ; and constructively engaging with policymakers , regulators , investors , customers , and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future . there can be no guarantee that the southern company system will achieve these goals . see management 's discussion and analysis – future earnings potential – "" environmental matters – environmental laws and regulations – greenhouse gases "" in item [X] herein for additional information . operational risks the financial performance of southern company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions . the financial performance of southern company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation , transmission , and distribution facilities , natural gas distribution facilities , and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions . there are many risks that could affect these matters , including operator error or failure of equipment or processes , accidents , operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements , labor disputes , physical attacks , fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages , transmission disruption or capacity constraints , including with respect to the southern company system 's and third parties ' transmission , storage , and transportation facilities , inability to maintain reliability consistent with customer expectations as the traditional electric operating companies and southern power transition their generating fleets in support of the southern company system 's net zero goal , compliance with mandatory reliability standards , including mandatory cyber security standards , implementation of new technologies , technology system failures , cyber intrusions , environmental events , such as spills or releases , supply chain disruptions , inflation , and catastrophic events such as fires , earthquakes , explosions , floods , tornadoes , hurricanes and other storms , droughts , pandemic health events , wars , political unrest , or other similar occurrences . operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks , including environmental , safety , health , regulatory , natural disasters , cyber intrusions , physical attacks , and financial risks , that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by alabama power or georgia power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage . alabama power owns , and contracts for the operation of , two nuclear units and georgia power holds undivided interests in , and contracts for the operation of , five existing nuclear units . the seven existing units are operated by southern nuclear and represented approximately [XX] % and [XX] % of the total kwhs generated by alabama power and georgia power , respectively , in the year ended december [XX] , [XXXX] . in addition , southern nuclear , on behalf of georgia power and the other vogtle owners , is managing the construction and start - up of plant vogtle unit [X] . nuclear facilities are subject to environmental , safety , health , operational , and financial risks such as : the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials ; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on - site storage ; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning ; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations ; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance , operation , security , and repair of these facilities . damages , decommissioning , or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage , including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance . the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety - related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities . in the event of non - compliance , the nrc has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit , depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation , until compliance is achieved . nrc orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future nrc safety requirements could require alabama power and georgia power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants . in addition , if a major nuclear incident were to occur , it could result in substantial costs to alabama power or georgia power and southern company . a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to require additional safety measures . moreover , a major incident at any nuclear facility in the united states , including facilities owned and operated by third parties , could require alabama power and georgia power to make material contributory payments . in addition , actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs . i-17 index to financial statements generation , transmission , and distribution of electricity and transportation and storage of natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs . the southern company system 's electric generation , transmission , and distribution and natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks , such as accidents , explosions , fires , mechanical problems , discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases , and other environmental risks . these incidents could result in serious injury , loss of life , significant damage to property , environmental pollution , and disruption of the southern company system 's operations . the location of electric generation , transmission , and distribution infrastructure and natural gas pipelines and underground natural gas storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage and liability resulting from any incidents . additionally , electric generation , transmission , and distribution infrastructure and natural gas pipelines and underground natural gas storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements . failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties . physical attacks , both threatened and actual , could impact the ability of the subsidiary registrants to operate . the subsidiary registrants face the risk of physical attacks , both threatened and actual , against their respective generation and storage facilities and the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport energy , which could negatively impact their ability to generate , transport , and deliver power , or otherwise operate their respective facilities , or , with respect to southern company gas , its ability to distribute or store natural gas , or otherwise operate its facilities , in the most efficient manner or at all . transmission and distribution infrastructure can be vulnerable to physical attack because it is often unmanned , widely dispersed , and located in isolated areas . the risk of physical attack may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions . in addition , physical attacks against third - party providers could have a similar effect on the southern company system . despite the implementation of robust security measures , all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability , failures , or unauthorized access due to human error , natural disasters , technological failure , or internal or external physical attacks . if assets were to fail , be physically damaged , or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner , the affected subsidiary registrant may be unable to fulfill critical business functions . insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses . an information security incident , including a cybersecurity breach , or the failure of , or inability to remotely access , one or more key technology systems , networks , or processes could impact the ability of the registrants to operate . the subsidiary registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology systems and network infrastructure , which are part of interconnected systems . because of the critical nature of the infrastructure and the technology systems ' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking , viruses , denial of service , ransomware , acts of war or terrorism , or other types of data security breaches , the registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattack . remote working arrangements also increase the registrants ' data security risks . additionally , the registrants ' field workforces use mobile technology , which have fewer security measures than the registrants ' wired networks . portions of the registrants ' system data , architecture , and other materials may also be disclosed , either intentionally or unintentionally , to third parties and the public by regulators , employees , contractors , and vendors . this system information may be used by malicious actors to understand the registrants ' systems to prepare for a cyberattack . in addition , unpatched software or network vulnerabilities , including those resulting from the use of end - of - life operating systems , could be leveraged by an attacker . cyber actors , including those associated with foreign governments , have attacked and threatened to attack energy infrastructure . various regulators have increasingly stressed that these attacks , including ransomware attacks , and attacks targeting utility systems and other critical infrastructure , are increasing in sophistication , magnitude , and frequency . in particular , certain actors , such as nation - state and state - sponsored actors , can deploy significant resources and employ sophisticated methods to plan and carry out attacks . risk of these attacks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions , such as those caused by the war in ukraine and conflicts in the middle east . the registrants and their third - party vendors have been subject , and will likely continue to be subject , to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations . while there have been immaterial incidents of phishing , unauthorized access to technology systems , financial fraud , and disruption of remote access across the southern company system , there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks . however , the registrants can not guarantee that security efforts will have the maturity to detect or prevent breaches , operational incidents , or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure . this is especially true in the event the registrants are targeted by a sophisticated attacker with significant resources , such as a nation - state or state - sponsored actor . further , the registrants do not have security visibility into all operational technology communications and processes , do not maintain completely exhaustive inventories of assets and applications , and do not centrally manage or monitor all technologies , applications , and environments , which could negatively affect preparation for , investigation of , or response to an information security incident . accordingly , the registrants can not provide any assurance that information security incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future . i-18 index to financial statements in addition , in the ordinary course of business , southern company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information , including personally identifiable information about customers , employees , and stockholders , and other confidential information . in some cases , administration of certain functions may be outsourced to third - party service providers . malicious actors may target these providers to disrupt the services they provide to the registrants , or to use those third parties to attack the registrants . the registrants do not fully assess the security maturity of all third - party service providers and such third - party service providers could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to their systems and/or could fail to timely notify the registrants of an information security incident . internal or external cyberattacks may have wide - reaching impacts due to incomplete segmentation among network assets and/or reliance of segmented networks on a disrupted network , inhibit the affected registrant 's ability to fulfill critical business functions , including energy delivery service failures , compromise sensitive and other data , violate privacy laws , and lead to customer dissatisfaction . any cyber breach or theft , damage , or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the affected registrant to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties . insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses . additionally , the cost and operational consequences of implementing , maintaining , and enhancing system protection measures are significant , and they could materially increase to address ever changing intense , complex , and sophisticated cyber risks . the southern company system may not be able to obtain adequate natural gas , fuel supplies , and other resources required to operate the traditional electric operating companies ' and southern power 's electric generating plants or serve southern company gas ' natural gas customers . scs , on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and southern power , purchases fuel for the southern company system 's generation fleet from a diverse set of suppliers . southern company gas ' primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities . natural gas is delivered daily from different regions of the country . this daily supply is complemented by natural gas supplies stored in both company - owned and third party storage locations . to deliver this daily supply and stored natural gas , the southern company system has firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate pipelines . disruption in the supply and/or delivery of fuel as a result of matters such as transportation delays , weather , labor relations , natural disasters , cyber or physical attacks , other force majeure events , or environmental regulations affecting fuel suppliers could limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and southern power to operate certain facilities , which could result in higher fuel and operating costs , and the ability of southern company gas to serve its natural gas customers . the traditional electric operating companies are also dependent on coal , and related coal supply contracts , for a portion of their electric generating capacity . the counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of financial or technical problems . in addition , the suppliers and/or railroads may be delayed in supplying or delivering or may not be required to supply or deliver coal under certain circumstances , such as in the event of a natural disaster . if the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain their contracted coal requirements , they may be required to purchase additional coal at higher prices or limit coal generation , and these increased costs may not be recoverable through rates if deemed to be imprudently incurred . coal deliveries continued to be delayed early in [XXXX] , which has largely been attributed to labor shortages in the railroad industry . service levels improved over the course of [XXXX] and deliveries returned to normal levels by the end of [XXXX] . as coal - fired generating facilities are retired , the demand for coal is expected to continue to decline . as a result , railroads may commit fewer resources to coal transportation , which could increase these risks . whereas fuel oil directly provides only a small portion of the southern company system 's annual generation , its importance to the reliability of the southern company system 's generation portfolio continues to grow . over the last few years , related cost increases and supply chain challenges have become more common and may increase the risk of reliability challenges . in addition to fuel supply , the traditional electric operating companies and southern power also need adequate access to water , which is drawn from nearby sources , to aid in the production of electricity . any impact to their water resources could also limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and southern power to operate certain facilities , which could result in higher fuel and operating costs . the revenues of southern company , the traditional electric operating companies , and southern power depend in part on sales under ppas , the success of which depend on ppa counterparties performing their obligations , southern company subsidiaries satisfying minimum requirements under the ppas , and renewal or replacement of the ppas for the related generating capacity . most of southern power 's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under ppas with southern power 's top three customers comprising approximately [XX] % of southern power 's total revenues for the year ended december [XX] , [XXXX] . the traditional electric operating companies have entered into ppas with non - affiliated parties for the sale of generating capacity . i-19 index to financial statements the revenues related to ppas are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations . although the credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by southern power and the traditional electric operating companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser , actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted or specified in the applicable contract . additionally , neither southern power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the ppas will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made . if a registrant is unable to replace expiring ppas with an acceptable new revenue contract , it may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale prices and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks , or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations . the failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these ppas , including ppas related to projects under construction , could result in payment of damages or termination of the ppas . increased competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies and changes in customer demand for energy could negatively impact southern company and its subsidiaries . the traditional electric operating companies operate under a business model that invests capital to serve customers and recovers those investments and earns a return for investors through state regulation . southern power 's business model is primarily focused on investing capital or building energy assets to serve creditworthy counterparties using a bilateral contract model . a key premise of these business models is that generating power at power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost . customers and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the registrants ' ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products , services , and offerings . additionally , the risk of global climate change continues to shape customers ' and stakeholders ' sustainability goals and energy needs . new technologies such as distributed energy resources and microgrids and increased customer and stakeholder demand for sustainable assets could change the type of assets constructed and/or the methods for cost recovery . advances in these technologies or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of distributed generation storage technologies or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in smaller - scale , more fuel efficient , and/or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self - generation by customers . broader use of distributed generation by retail energy customers may also result from customers ' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives . additionally , a state psc or legislature may modify certain aspects of the traditional electric operating companies ' business as a result of these advances in technology , which may provide for further competition from these alternative sources of generation . it is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and southern power . changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power . southern company gas ' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy . southern company gas ' gas marketing services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing similar services in southern company gas ' unregulated service territories , most notably in illinois and georgia . if new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale , the market share of the subsidiary registrants could be eroded , and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution facilities could be reduced . additionally , these technology and customer - induced changes to the subsidiary registrants ' business models could change the risk profile of the southern company system 's historical capital investments . southern company gas ' market share could be reduced if southern company gas can not remain price competitive in its unregulated markets . the subsidiary registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations . the southern company system must attract , train , and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs . events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements , increased cost or reduced supply of labor , mismatch of skill sets to future needs , or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources , loss of knowledge , and a lengthy time period associated with skill development , including workforce needs associated with construction projects and ongoing operations . the southern company system may be subject to continuing workforce trends occurring in the united states triggered by decisions of employees to leave the workforce and/or their employer in higher rates during recent years as compared to prior years and challenges competing with other employers offering more flexible or fully - remote work options . the southern company system 's costs , including costs for contractors to replace employees , productivity costs , and safety costs , may rise . the southern company system is also subject to risks associated with the failure to adequately manage contract resources . in addition , the failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees , including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees , or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect southern company and its subsidiaries ' ability to manage and operate their businesses . i-20 index to financial statements supply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact operations . the southern company system 's operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure equipment , materials , and other resources . the delivery of components , materials , equipment , and other resources that are critical to the southern company system 's operations has been impacted by domestic and global supply chain disruptions . future pandemic health events or continued international tensions , including the ramifications of regional conflicts , such as those in ukraine and the middle east , could further exacerbate global supply chain disruptions . these disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations . the constraints in the supply chain also could restrict availability and delay construction , maintenance , or repair of items needed to support normal operations or to continue planned capital investments . supply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components , materials , equipment , and other needed commodities , and these inflationary increases may continue . further inflation , a continued elevated interest rate environment , or other economic factors may negatively affect operations and the timely recovery of costs . construction risks the registrants have incurred and may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recover their investments . also , existing facilities of the subsidiary registrants require ongoing expenditures , including those to meet aros and other environmental standards and goals . the businesses of the registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities as well as capital improvements , including transmission , distribution , and generation facilities for the traditional electric operating companies , generation facilities for southern power , and capital improvements to natural gas distribution facilities for southern company gas . these expenditures also include those to settle aros and meet environmental standards and goals . the traditional electric operating companies and southern power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and/or adding environmental and other modifications to certain existing generating facilities and southern company gas is replacing certain pipe in its natural gas distribution system . the traditional electric operating companies also are in the process of closing ash ponds to comply with the ccr rule and , where applicable , state ccr rules . the southern company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities , expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems , and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations . these projects are long - term in nature and in some cases may include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed . completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks that have occurred or may occur , including labor costs , availability , and productivity ; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors ; subcontractor performance ; adverse weather conditions ; shortages , delays , increased costs , or inconsistent quality of equipment , materials , and labor ; contractor or supplier delay ; the impacts of inflation ; delays due to judicial or regulatory action ; nonperformance under construction , operating , or other agreements ; operational readiness , including specialized operator training and required site safety programs ; engineering or design problems or any remediation related thereto ; design and other licensing - based compliance matters ; challenges with start - up activities , including major equipment failure , or system integration ; and/or operational performance ; challenges related to pandemic health events ; continued public and policymaker support for projects ; environmental and geological conditions ; delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids ; and increased financing costs as a result of changes in interest rates or as a result of project delays . if a subsidiary registrant is unable to complete the development or construction of a project or decides to delay or cancel construction of a project , it may not be able to recover its investment in that project and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts , as well as other costs associated with the closure and/or abandonment of the construction project . in addition , partnership and joint ownership agreements may provide partners or co - owners with certain decision - making authority in connection with projects under construction , including the right to cause the cancellation of a construction project under certain circumstances . any failure by a partner or co - owner to perform its obligations under the applicable agreements could have a material negative impact on the applicable project under construction . southern power participates in partnership agreements with respect to a majority of its renewable energy projects and georgia power jointly owns plant vogtle unit [X] with other co - owners . see note [X] to the financial statements under "" joint ownership agreements "" in item [X] herein for additional information regarding other jointly - owned facilities . if construction projects are not completed according to specification , a registrant may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency , higher operating costs , and reduced net income . furthermore , construction delays associated with renewable projects could result in the loss of otherwise available tax credits and incentives . even if a construction project ( including a joint venture construction project ) is completed , the total costs may be higher than estimated or deemed imprudent and may be disallowed or otherwise not recoverable through regulated rates , if applicable . in i-21 index to financial statements addition , construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues . the largest construction project currently underway in the southern company system is plant vogtle unit [X] . southern company and georgia power recorded cumulative pre - tax charges to income of $ [X.X] billion ( $ [X.X] billion after tax ) through december [XX] , [XXXX] to reflect georgia power 's revised estimate to complete construction and start - up of plant vogtle units [X] and [X] . see note [X] to the financial statements under "" georgia power – nuclear construction "" in item [X] herein for information regarding plant vogtle units [X] and [X] . once facilities become operational , ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain safe and reliable levels of operation . significant portions of the traditional electric operating companies ' existing facilities were constructed many years ago . older equipment , even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices , may require significant expenditures to maintain efficiency , to comply with environmental requirements , to provide safe and reliable operations , and/or to meet related retirement obligations . financial , economic , and market risks the electric generation and energy marketing operations of the traditional electric operating companies and southern power and the natural gas operations of southern company gas are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs . the generation , energy marketing , and natural gas operations of the southern company system are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs , which could increase the cost of producing power , decrease the amount received from the sale of energy , and/or make electric generating facilities and natural gas distribution systems less competitive . the market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand , which could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the registrants . for the traditional electric operating companies and southern company gas ' regulated gas distribution operations , such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates . southern power and the traditional electric operating companies purchase natural gas as a fuel source for their power generation needs and the natural gas distribution utilities purchase natural gas for sale to their customers . accordingly , the price of natural gas affects , among other things , southern power 's and the traditional electric operating companies ' costs of generation and the natural gas distribution utilities ' cost of natural gas . natural gas remains a volatile commodity . slight supply and demand imbalances can quickly result in significant price moves both up and down . these price movements may be short - lived , but the impacts can be pronounced . natural gas supplies , primarily from the permian and haynesville regions , have continued to grow ; however , this growth has been accompanied by lng export growth . forward curves project prices will remain in the range of mid - to high- $ [X] per mmbtu , approaching $ [X] per mmbtu , through [XXXX] ; however , short - term price volatility is expected and future prices could be materially impacted by various factors , including unexpected geopolitical events as well as government policies related to natural gas infrastructure development , production , and exports . the traditional electric operating companies and southern company gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience underrecovered fuel and purchased power and/or purchased gas cost balances . while the traditional electric operating companies and southern company gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and purchased power and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses , recovery may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred . the registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment , customer behaviors , including increased energy conservation , and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the subsidiary registrants . the consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity . this relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy , customer behaviors , and technologies . an economic downturn could be caused by a variety of factors , including wars , geopolitical instability , acts of terrorism , political or financial crises , pandemic health events , or cyclical economic factors . any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer . additionally , any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets , both nationally and internationally , could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the subsidiary registrants . outside of economic disruptions , changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs , changing conditions and preferences , legislation , or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy . for example , some jurisdictions in the united states have banned the use of natural gas in new construction . both federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy , and several of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have state psc or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy efficiency . customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income , increases in energy prices , or individual conservation efforts . i-22 index to financial statements in addition , the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales . many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past . however , electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can create additional demand . the southern company system seeks to incorporate the effects of changes in customer behavior , state and federal programs , state psc or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates , and technology , but the southern company system 's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects . the operating results of the registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis . in addition , catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a subsidiary registrant . electric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses . the subsidiary registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder . volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional electric operating companies , the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and southern power , and the natural gas distribution and underground storage facilities of southern company gas , which is likely to negatively impact revenue . the subsidiary registrants have significant investments in the atlantic and gulf coast regions and southern power and southern company gas have investments in various states that could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters , including hurricanes and wildfires . further , severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities . these volatile weather events may result in unexpected increases in customer load , requiring procurement of additional power at wholesale prices , or create other grid reliability issues . in the event a traditional electric operating company or southern company gas experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event , recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state psc or other applicable state regulatory agency . the traditional electric operating companies from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances . additionally , the applicable state psc or other applicable state regulatory agency may deny or delay recovery of any portion of such costs . in addition , damages resulting from significant weather events occurring within a subsidiary registrant 's service territory or otherwise affecting its customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for energy for extended periods and may impact customers ' ability to perform under existing ppas . acquisitions , dispositions , or other strategic ventures or investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks , including risks not originally contemplated . southern company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions , dispositions , and investments in the past and may continue to do so . such actions can not be assured to be completed or beneficial to southern company or its subsidiaries . southern company and its subsidiaries continually seek opportunities to create value through various transactions , including acquisitions or sales of assets . specifically , southern power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions , including acquisitions , dispositions , and sales of partnership interests , development and construction of new generating facilities , and entry into ppas primarily with investor - owned utilities , ipps , municipalities , and other load - serving entities , as well as commercial and industrial customers . additionally , southern company gas has made significant investments in existing pipelines , most of which are operated by third parties . if one of these agents fails to perform in a proper manner , the value of the investment could decline and southern company gas could lose part or all of its investment . in addition , southern company gas is required to fulfill capital obligations to pipeline joint ventures . southern company and its subsidiaries may face significant competition for transactional opportunities and anticipated transactions may not be completed on acceptable terms or at all . in addition , these transactions are intended to , but may not , result in the generation of cash or income , the realization of savings , the creation of efficiencies , or the reduction of risk . these transactions also involve risks , including that they may not result in an increase in income or provide adequate or expected cash flows or return on capital or other anticipated benefits ; they may result in southern company or its subsidiaries entering into new or additional lines of business , which may have new or different business or operational risks ; they may not be successfully integrated into the acquiring company 's operations , internal control processes , and/or accounting systems ; the due diligence conducted prior to a transaction may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or may not appropriately evaluate the likelihood or quantify the exposure from identified risks ; they may result in impairment or decreased earnings , revenues , or cash flow ; they may result in credit rating downgrades for southern company or its subsidiaries ; they may involve retained obligations in connection with transitional agreements or deferred payments related to dispositions that subject southern company or its subsidiaries to additional risk ; southern company or the applicable subsidiary may not be able to achieve the expected financial benefits from the use of funds generated by any dispositions ; expected benefits of a transaction may be dependent on the cooperation , performance , or credit risk of a counterparty ; minority investments in growth companies may not result in a positive return on investment ; or , for the traditional electric operating i-23 index to financial statements companies and southern company gas , costs associated with such investments that were expected to be recovered through regulated rates may not be recoverable . southern company and southern company gas are holding companies and southern power owns many of its assets indirectly through subsidiaries . each of these companies is dependent on cash flows from their respective subsidiaries to meet their ongoing and future financial obligations . southern company and southern company gas are holding companies and , as such , they have no operations of their own . substantially all of southern company 's and southern company gas ' and many of southern power 's respective consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries . southern company 's , southern company gas ' and , to a certain extent , southern power 's ability to meet their respective financial obligations , including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness , and , for southern company , to pay dividends on its common stock , is dependent on the net income and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds . prior to funding southern company , southern company gas , or southern power , the respective subsidiaries have financial obligations and , with respect to southern company and southern company gas , regulatory restrictions that must be satisfied , including among others , debt service . in addition , southern company , southern company gas , and southern power may provide capital contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances , which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations , including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness , and to pay dividends on southern company 's common stock . a downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the registrants , southern company gas capital , or nicor gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness . there are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to determine credit ratings for the registrants , southern company gas capital , and nicor gas , including capital structure , regulatory environment , the ability to cover liquidity requirements , other commitments for capital , and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events . the registrants , southern company gas capital , and nicor gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated . changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings . if one or more rating agencies downgrade any registrant , southern company gas capital , or nicor gas , borrowing costs likely would increase , including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities , the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease , and , particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade , significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts . any credit rating downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company . uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs . the traditional electric operating companies and southern power each engage in a long - term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations . southern company gas engages in a long - term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines , replacing existing pipelines , and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets . these planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities . inherent risk exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors , including economic conditions , customer usage patterns , efficiency programs , and customer technology adoption . because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all , these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in customers ' rates . in addition , under southern power 's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market - based rates under long - term ppas , southern power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts . southern power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace existing ppas upon expiration , or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended . the traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers , as well as wholesale customers under long - term ppas
